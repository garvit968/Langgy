(Operator Instructions) I\\'d now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nEllen West,  Alphabet Inc. - VP of IR    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\\'s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I\\'ll quickly cover the safe harbor.\\\\nSome of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.\\\\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today\\'s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.\\\\nAnd now I\\'ll turn the call over to Sundar.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Helen. Q2 was an exciting quarter at Google. We made several big announcements at I/O, YouTube\\'s Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. They\\'re all part of our broader vision to build a more helpful Google for everyone. \\\\nWhen we say everyone, we mean users, developers, creators, partners, advertisers and all the customers of our growing cloud business and the communities we call home. From the beginning, Google\\'s mission has been to organize the world\\'s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Over the years, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. Today, I\\'ll share how we are approaching this work.  \\\\nBuilding a more helpful Google starts with advancing our core information mission. In Q2, we have made a number of improvements to our founding product, Search. We redesigned our mobile search page and brought our popular full coverage feature to Search to better organize news results. We are also integrating augmented reality into Search. So if, say, you\\'re searching for new shoes online, you can view the shoes in 3D or even superimpose them onto your wardrobe to see if they match.\\\\nThanks to advancements in AI, we are making significant improvements to the Google Assistant. The next-generation Assistant can process requests up to 10x faster, making it easier to multitask, compose e-mails and even work offline. With features like Duplex on the Web, the Assistant will soon be able to help users book rental cars and buy movie tickets. \\\\nIf you are searching for the fastest way home, Google Maps will now tell you when your bus is delayed or how packed your next train will be. We have rolled this out to people in 200 cities worldwide. \\\\nGoogle Maps can also help people stay safe in times of crisis. Last month, we added more visual information and a new navigation warning system to help you understand where a natural disaster is and better anticipate where it may be headed. \\\\nBuilding a more helpful Google for everyone means that everyone should be able to access and enjoy our products. That\\'s why we are applying the latest advances in AI to dramatically improve experiences for people with disabilities. One example of this is captions, which make content more accessible to the almost 500 million people in the world who are deaf or hard of hearing. In Android Q, we can now add automatic live captions to any media playing on your phone such as videos, podcasts and voicemails. \\\\nWe are also developing technology for the next billion users coming online in places like India, Brazil and Indonesia. Yesterday, we introduced the Gallery Go app. It\\'s a way for people living in low connectivity areas to manage their photos and videos while off-line. Google Photos continues to be one of our most popular and beloved products now with over 1 billion monthly users, and we are excited by the potential of Gallery Go to bring these benefits to the next billion users. \\\\nBuilding for everyone also means ensuring that privacy is equally available to everyone. In Q2, we announced privacy improvements to give users clear choices and more control around their data. We\\'re making privacy controls more easily accessible, expanding our popular Incognito Mode to maps and adding new auto delete controls. And we continue to challenge the notion that products need more data to be more helpful. For example, we invented a new technique called Federated Learning that allows us to train AI models and make products smarter without raw data leaving your device.\\\\nTo make products work even harder for you, we have continued to invest in our hardware business, bringing together the best of Google\\'s hardware, software and AI. At I/O, we introduced some new additions to our hardware lineup, including Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. By taking advantage of our leading software capabilities, we can offer users a premium phone experience at a much lower price point. \\\\nWith the launch of Pixel 3a in May, overall Pixel unit sales in Q2 grew more than 2x year-over-year. In addition to Verizon and the Google Store, we successfully expanded our distribution to T-Mobile, Sprint, U.S. Cellular, Spectrum Mobile and additional partners, which has greatly diversified our sales footprint in the U.S. Finally, we\\'re also pleased that the Pixel 3a launch was met with our highest Net Promoter Score ratings to date. \\\\nWe are also doubling down on creating a helpful Home, bringing all of our Home products together under the Nest brand. In Q2, we launched the Nest Hub in 12 additional countries. Demand across our helpful Home products continues to increase as we expand to new markets. Our new Google Nest Hub Max, a voice-activated smart display powered by the Google Assistant, will be available later this summer. Stay tuned for even more on hardware this fall.\\\\nBeyond hardware, we continue to develop the open platforms and ecosystems that push computing forward such as Android, Google Play and Chrome. At I/O, we showed some exciting improvements to Android Q. It\\'s the first operating system to support 5G, includes support for foldable phones and has nearly 50 updates focused on security and privacy, including more transparency and control over the location data you share with the apps. \\\\nAnd we continue to feel the excitement from users, developers and publishers following the announcement of our new gaming platform, Stadia. We recently announced pricing, availability and over 30 games coming to Stadia in time for the consumer launch in November. \\\\nAnother area where we are investing deeply is YouTube. Every day, users come to YouTube to learn new things. As a result, YouTube has become one of the world\\'s most accessible educational platforms. We see strong growth in a number of areas. Creators continue to build engaged fan bases on YouTube. Channels with more than 1 million subscribers grew by 75% year-over-year. Thousands of channels have doubled their total monthly revenue by using new monetization products like Super Chat, Channel Memberships and Merch. And we are building momentum with our subscription services, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, now available in over 60 countries, up from 5 markets at the start of 2018. \\\\nAt Brandcast, we introduced 2 important changes that help advertisers reach new audiences with premium content. First, new YouTube Original series, movies and live events will soon be made available for free supported by ads. Second, YouTube TV, with its 70-plus channels, will be accessible as a stand-alone lineup in Google Preferred. \\\\nAs we continue to invest in the platform, responsibility remains our top priority. One significant change we made in Q2 was to update our hate speech policy, and we continue to be vigilant about removing harmful content quickly and at scale. In the first quarter alone, we removed more than 8 million videos that violated our community guidelines. The vast majority of those videos were flagged by machines and removed before getting a single view. We are also working to raise up high-quality content and support our creators, who are our next generation media businesses. These are a few of the many investments we have made to protect the community. The work is ongoing and we are committed to it.\\\\nMoving from YouTube to broader advertising platforms. At Google Marketing Live, we introduced new ad formats such as discovery ads, which offer a new visually rich mobile-first ad experience across Google properties. We also announced a unified shopping experience and universal shopping cart, all of which help to make Google more shoppable. We also announced Google Travel, a new centralized travel destination, where people can plan and organize all aspects of their next trip all in one place, from booking flights and accommodations to planning activities.\\\\nNow on to our Cloud business. Q2 was another strong quarter for Google Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of over $8 billion and continues to grow at a significant pace. Customers are choosing Google Cloud for a variety of reasons. Reliability and uptime are critical. Retailers like Lowe\\'s are leveraging the cloud as one of the important tools to transform their customer experience and supply chain. \\\\nCustomers need flexibility to move to cloud in their own way. Anthos, announced earlier this year, provides advanced security and open architecture to support multi- and hybrid cloud environments. That\\'s important to many companies, including financial services customers like HSBC and new clients such as KeyBanc.\\\\nScalable data management and analytics solutions are another strength of Google Cloud. Vodafone is using cloud to drive real-time customer and network analytics; and BrightInsight, a leading health care platform for connected devices and drugs, uses our solutions to improve security and compliance.\\\\nFinally, Google Cloud\\'s AI and ML solutions are also helping health care organizations like Sanofi accelerate drug discovery and [Ascension] improve the health care experience and outcomes. We continue to build our world-class cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business and are looking to triple our sales force over the next few years.\\\\nFinally, to support our rapidly growing cloud customer base and all of Google services globally, we broke ground on 3 data centers and launched our new Osaka cloud region, the seventh in the Asia Pacific. We also announced plans for a new cloud region in Las Vegas, our seventh in the United States. \\\\nLastly, beyond investments in products, we are investing significantly in the communities where we operate. In Europe, we recently announced EUR 1 billion data center investment in the Netherlands as well as the opening of our Google Safety Engineering Center in Munich, Germany. And right here at home, we announced a $1 billion investment in housing across the Bay Area to help address the chronic shortage of affordable housing. \\\\nEarlier this week, we invested $50 million in Housing Trust Silicon Valley\\'s TECH Fund, which furthers our goal to help communities succeed over the long term and expands access to housing for those who need it most.\\\\nFinally, I\\'m excited that Google is an official supporter of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020. It\\'s particularly special since that\\'s where we opened our first international office back in 2001. Ahead of the games, we are working with the City of Tokyo to ensure Japanese businesses can better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time there using products like Search, Maps and Translate.\\\\nAt Google, we feel incredibly privileged to have the opportunity to help so many people every day in moments big and small. There are many reasons to be optimistic about the direction technology is taking from the applications of AI to address disease to the potential of quantum computing to deepen our understanding of the world. \\\\nI want to thank Googlers around the world for another great quarter. With that, I will hand it over to Ruth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Sundar. In the second quarter, total revenues of $38.9 billion were up 19% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search in particular as well as YouTube and Cloud. I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and we\\'ll include with our outlook. We will then take your questions.\\\\nLet me start with a summary of Alphabet\\'s consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $38.9 billion reflect an acceleration in both reported and constant currency revenue growth across all regions compared with the first quarter. Details of our results by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.\\\\nTurning to profitability. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.3 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses. \\\\nThe biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising-supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line was also impacted by growth in hardware costs associated with the launch of our line of mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones.\\\\nOperating expenses were $12.5 billion with headcount growth as the largest driver across each of R&D, sales and marketing and G&A. The biggest increase once again was in R&D expenses reflecting our focus on product innovation. Growth in sales and marketing expenses also reflects an increase in advertising and promotional expense primarily for the launch of our Pixel 3a lineup.\\\\nStock-based compensation totaled $2.8 billion. Headcount was up 4,187 from last quarter. And consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in cloud for both technical and sales roles.\\\\nOperating income was $9.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of the EC fine in the second quarter of last year for an operating margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $3 billion reflecting sizable gains, which are primarily unrealized, from investments made by CapitalG, GV and more broadly at Alphabet. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Net income was $9.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $14.21. \\\\nTurning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6.1 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $12.6 billion with free cash flow of $6.5 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $121 billion.\\\\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were 38.9 -- $38.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27.3 billion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.\\\\nNetwork revenues were $5.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network, namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob. \\\\nOther revenues for Google were $6.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, with an ongoing strong contribution from Play. Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products. G Suite continues to be a valued set of productivity and work transformation apps with results benefiting from both new pricing and seat growth. Play\\'s results were driven by strong growth in a number of active buyers.\\\\nHardware benefited from the successful launch of our Pixel 3a smartphones. We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.\\\\nTotal traffic acquisition costs were $7.2 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 13% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year reflecting primarily a favorable revenue mix shift from network to Sites. The Sites TAC rate increased year-over-year primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, offset by the growth in TAC-free Sites revenues primarily from YouTube. \\\\nIn Q2, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a favorable product mix shift. Operating income was $10.4 billion, up 16% versus last year and the operating margin was 26.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.9 billion reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers followed by servers.\\\\nLet me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. Revenues were $162 million primarily generated by Fiber and Verily with an operating loss of $989 million. \\\\nI\\'ll note a couple of key recent accomplishments. Waymo now has over 1,000 active riders participating in Waymo One and has reached 10 billion miles driven in simulation. Waymo also announced that it has entered into an exclusive partnership with Renault and Nissan to explore driverless mobility services for passengers and deliveries in France and Japan. \\\\nLoon was once again able to step in and provide connectivity in the aftermath of a natural disaster after the recent earthquake in Peru. This follows previous deployments of Loon after hurricanes in Puerto Rico and floods in Peru.\\\\nLet me now conclude with some comments about our longer-term outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the third quarter. As a reminder, FX headwinds affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S. Turning to revenues. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in our revenue growth, especially on a base of nearly $150 billion in revenues over the last 12 months. \\\\nWith respect to Sites revenues. The strength in the second quarter again reflects our ongoing innovation in part from the benefits of applying machine learning. We remain confident about the ongoing opportunity set.\\\\nAnd within other revenues, once again, Cloud was the largest driver within other revenues and the third largest driver of revenue growth for Alphabet overall. In fact, in the second quarter of 2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and Cloud continues to deliver significant growth. \\\\nIn terms of our hardware business, we were pleased with the reception of the Pixel 3a lineup of mid-tier smartphones in the second quarter and look forward to the fourth quarter launch of our newest devices, some of which we showcased at I/O.\\\\nTurning to profitability. With regard to Google operating expenses, the second quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long term. At this point, we expect that our 2019 headcount growth rate will be closer to the 2018 rate, in other words, slightly higher than we originally forecast for a couple of reasons. Strategically, we are increasing our hiring in Cloud and are incorporating the impact of the Looker acquisition, which we expect to close before the end of this year. And operationally, we\\'re taking steps to optimize workforce deployment by moving certain customer support functions in-house, which is both OpEx-neutral and enhances operational effectiveness. As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates.\\\\nIn terms of sales and marketing, consistent with prior years, we expect sales and marketing to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year to support the holiday season. In Other Bets, we continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity we see.\\\\nTurning to CapEx and capital allocation. To give you more insight into our investment and capital expenditures, I will discuss the 2 major components of Google CapEx separately. \\\\nFirst, the majority of our Google CapEx is what we refer to as technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments for compute, storage and networking requirements and includes data center land and construction, servers and network equipment. \\\\nThe second category of CapEx is for our office facilities, including acquisitions, ground-up development projects and related building improvements. In the last couple of years within Google CapEx, on average, approximately 70% was for technical infrastructure and 30% was for office facilities. Both the split between the 2 components and year-on-year growth rates can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due primarily to the timing of sizable purchases of office facilities.\\\\nFor example, in Q1, technical infrastructure was about 80% of Google CapEx, whereas in Q2, it accounts for about 60% due to the purchases of office facilities we made in the quarter. As we discussed on the fourth quarter call, we believe there are 2 important factors when considering our pace of CapEx investing. \\\\nFirst, we expect the overall growth rate will moderate quite significantly for the full year 2019 versus 2018. Second, in terms of the mix within technical infrastructure, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers in contrast to the ranking in 2018.\\\\nGrowth in technical infrastructure is designed to support in particular our efforts in machine learning across our businesses as well as to support growth in Cloud, Search and YouTube. \\\\nWith respect to capital allocation. Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $25 billion of our Class C capital stock. \\\\nIn conclusion, we are confident about the opportunities ahead and continue to invest thoughtfully for the long term. We will now take your questions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nEric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I really appreciate all the additional commentary and disclosure in the remarks. I think investors will find that really helpful. \\\\nSundar, maybe for you. One bigger picture question. A lot of innovation on the product side in the early part of this year. Now those products are going to start getting rolled out in the back part of this year and into 2020. Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what\\'s some of the key investments you\\'re making, some of the key themes you\\'re trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strength within Google? \\\\nAnd then the second part of the question would be as you lower friction for consumers on the product side, what are you hearing from advertisers on the monetization side about how those product might resonate on the monetization piece?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Eric. On -- in terms of the key investments, we still continue. We have been focused on our investments in AI. So that continues to be kind of a foundational investment we are making across the board, including getting a lot of our engineers trained on AI techniques, et cetera, across the board. So it\\'s an important area we are focused on. And making sure digging deeper to push our products to be more helpful is the main theme by which we are evaluating everything we do. \\\\nBeyond that, be it the focus on Cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to scale up YouTube, including being focused on content responsibility. These are all some of the key things we are doing. And of course, deep focus on Search and Assistant being a core part of everything we do. \\\\nIn terms of the work we are doing on consumers and the impact it has on monetization, and I do think they go hand in hand. As we are making the experience better for customers, including on products like Discover, so just getting information to them more seamlessly when they need it, I think they all tend to have a commercial aspect at the right intent when users are interested in it. So we\\'ve always seen them go hand to hand. And so taking a long-term view, I think it will resonate on the monetization side as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And just building a bit on that question and the impact from some of the announcements that you\\'ve seen from us. I\\'ll just comment a bit on the impact from Google Marketing Live that Sundar referenced at the outset. I think what\\'s notable here is that every year at GML, we announce new changes to products and features, and most ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats. And so as a result, the new products that were announced at GML typically are adopted over time. And so I just wanted to add in here because while we\\'re excited about the new ads products we announced at GML last quarter, given they offer great new user experiences across new services, we don\\'t view this year\\'s slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDouglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I was just hoping, Ruth, if you could talk a little bit more just about the accelerating growth that you saw in 2Q relative to the slowdown that we saw in 1Q. It seemed certainly in the previous quarter to skew more to the Google Search side than YouTube. I was just hoping you could provide a little more clarity on maybe how the product changes that you\\'ve talked about in the past played out across 1Q and 2Q. \\\\nAnd then just, Sundar, on user privacy and control over data. That was certainly a key theme across the multiple events in 2Q. Can you just talk about how you balance those initiatives as you\\'re rolling out products going forward?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So starting first with the strength in Sites revenue. The strength that we\\'ve talked about here this quarter reflects the same underlying trends that we discussed previously. And I tried to really call that out in opening comments. And part is the benefit from applying machine learning to both the user and advertiser experience. And it really just -- I\\'m echoing a lot of what we\\'ve said in prior quarters, last quarters. Well, we remain very positive about the opportunity set. We introduce product changes only after extensive testing, which means there can be some variability in quarterly growth rates, as you\\'ve seen. But we are very positive about the opportunity set. \\\\nAnd overall, as it relates to both Search and YouTube strength, just to add on YouTube, revenue growth for YouTube was strong in the first quarter. In fact, we called it out as the second largest driver of revenue growth across Alphabet. And in the second quarter, YouTube was again the second largest contributor of revenue growth. And we\\'re really, really pleased with the ongoing momentum that we\\'re seeing here.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On user privacy and control, it\\'s always been a big focus for us in some of the things we recently announced, where initiative is underway, for example, like Federated Learning for almost 3 years. So going forward, I think you\\'ll continue to see us focus on it. It\\'s one of the most important areas we are working on. But I think with AI, we are excited that we can give better experiences for users with less data over time. And those are the kind of directions we are pushing.\\\\nWe are also -- we\\'ll -- you\\'ll see us continue to work hard to simplify user understanding of how their data is used and giving them better controls and making it more easy for them to manage and making sure more users actually exercise those controls. So those are all our goals, and we\\'ll continue focusing on that as we move forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStephen D. Ju,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So Ruth, in regards to the Cloud, $8 billion annual run rate commentary. Just wondering if we can get some clarifications there. Does this include GCP as well as G Suite? And further, is this apples-to-apples to, I guess, the $1 billion that you -- I think Sundar talked about? I think that was during the fourth quarter of \\'17. And any other commentary you can add there in terms of the mix between, I guess, the more GCP versus the more traditional G Suite?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So it does include the entire business that Thomas Kurian is leading, our Cloud business that includes both GCP and G Suite. And it is on an apples-to-apples basis. It continues to be the business, the Cloud business. We\\'re not breaking out the components of Cloud. As I tried to indicate in opening comments, pleased with the performance of both GCP and G Suite. \\\\nGrowth in GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products, and G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I noted in the opening comments with results benefiting from both new pricing and seat growth. And overall, GCP remains one of the fastest-growing businesses in Alphabet, and we\\'re really pleased with how the team is executing on both.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHeather Anne Bellini,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And I\\'ll just echo people\\'s comments about the new disclosure. It\\'s much appreciated, so thank you so much for sharing. \\\\nI wanted to ask, Sundar, how you\\'ve seen your go-to-market and partnership strategies change under Thomas? It does seem as if Google has become the more friendly cloud company, if you will, from a -- when you think about partnering with other software companies. And I\\'m wondering if there\\'s any tangible benefits you can point to because of this, whether it\\'s in win rates or partner momentum or anything else that you can call out. \\\\nAnd then I also wanted to ask, you obviously made the acquisition of Looker recently. How are you thinking about organic versus inorganic product development? And I\\'m just wondering, has the thought process there changed with Thomas running the business now?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Heather. I appreciate it. Definitely, go-to-market, Thomas, has been heavily focused on it mainly with the realization that we are very competitive when we are there in the mix and so focusing on how we can scale up and really build a customer-facing organization. So we are investing heavily, be it in sales, service, partner and operational teams. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we are looking to triple the size of our sales force over the next few years, and we are doing it aggressively in major markets around the world.\\\\nSome specifics. We did launch our new partner program, Partner Advantage. The SAP relationship has been super important to us. And so we\\'ve really focused on that, helping many customers. McKesson, Carrefour, Home Depot, Cardinal Health are some examples of that. \\\\nAnd a big part of it has been really expanding our customer-facing bench. Several new senior executive hires in addition to our new global Head of Sales. We recently added a 25-year customer experience veteran to build out our customer support.\\\\nSo I think you\\'re going to see that focus of being -- serving customers. We have done it in our other areas. We are used to building ecosystems. If you look at an ecosystem like Android, this is what we do. And so that\\'s going to be a focus for us. \\\\nIn terms of the second question about organic versus inorganic. I think we are clearly focused on the areas where we are differentiated. Data and business analytics was a key -- data management and analytics is a key area for us. And as part of that, we looked at gaps we have, which would help us complete the solution offering we have there for customers. And that\\'s what drove the Looker acquisition. So we\\'ll be customer-focused. And to the extent we see gaps there, gaps anywhere, we\\'ll obviously look at doing it in-house versus whether there\\'s an attractive opportunity outside, and take it on a case-by-case basis. But that\\'s where it will come from.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Two questions, please. First, Ruth, just any color on that $25 billion share repurchase authorization, why $25 billion, not $20 billion, not $30 billion? Any color there?\\\\nAnd then when you think about the ad business, we\\'ve seen this nice acceleration in Q2, but that\\'s kind of back to norm. There\\'s still this question about what happened in Q1. Was there something that happened in Q1 that you needed to correct in Q2? Is it just the normal rhythms of the Search and YouTube and advertising businesses? So I find Q1 still a little bit of a question mark. Q2 seems like very much the norm over the last several years. So any color on what could have transpired in Q1 and did that require a fix in Q2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'ll answer them in reverse order. I tried to comment on that last quarter and reiterated again this quarter. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in the business. And the key point that I\\'ll just reiterate is that as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business, and we\\'ve talked about that, we introduce product changes only after extensive testing, and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates, as you\\'ve seen. And so we\\'re pleased with the strength of the business. The team is extremely focused on ensuring we\\'re delivering for users and advertisers. \\\\nAnd as we\\'re looking out, we talked in the past, we have introduced over 100 enhancements to the user set every quarter and no one change drives results. And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability, and our view is let\\'s ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long term and the quality that we can deliver.\\\\nSo there\\'s really not much more to add there. And then on the capital return, I guess, the main point is we went back to the -- we\\'re staying with the same capital allocation framework we\\'ve talked with you about before. The primary thing is we remain focused on investing for long-term growth and the primary use of capital really is to support that growth. And then the second use is really to support acquisitions and investments as we\\'ve already been talking about.\\\\nAnd given the -- our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We\\'ve increased our program 4x since we began the program in 2015 and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the $25 billion. And I think the main point is we view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBrian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have 2. The first one. Ruth, your color on YouTube was really helpful on it being the second largest driver this quarter and last quarter. I guess with that as a backdrop, with the overall acceleration, can you just give us a couple of examples of what types of products or advertiser segments or regions resonated particularly well on YouTube this quarter versus last quarter? \\\\nAnd then sort of a question for Sundar or Ruth. There has been a decent amount in the press about children\\'s safety on YouTube. And so I guess I\\'d be curious to hear for advertisers and parents on the call, what steps have you taken to really make sure that YouTube is safe for kids? And what are sort of the biggest areas you\\'re focused on to ensure it stays that way?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given your question. I already noted that YouTube revenue growth was strong in the first quarter and again strong here in the second quarter. \\\\nTo clarify, the changes in early 2018 that I referenced on the call last quarter regarding Sites click and CPC growth were not related to policy enforcement actions at YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues, just to be really clear. The revenue growth was strong last quarter. And so the click and CPC growth are unrelated to actions on policy enforcement.\\\\nAnd in terms of our ongoing efforts to protect the YouTube ecosystem, we do remain focused on taking the right steps in line with our goals regardless of the impact on revenues. But an important point is that our removal of content that violates our policies have virtually no impact on YouTube revenues. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. So consistent growth here.\\\\nGoing into your -- the first part of your question. Where is that growth? Again, I\\'m going to reiterate what we\\'ve talked about on prior calls that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response. So brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It\\'s growing at a strong pace. But really, I would reiterate what we said previously that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And on your important question about kids\\' safety. As part of our content responsibility work, it\\'s one of the most important areas we focus on. You will see us -- this is why we have put a lot of effort into developing YouTube Kids. And it\\'s a product you\\'re going to see us focus more and continue to evolve, add more curated content there and make sure it\\'s safe for kids and gives parents peace of mind. Also ensuring that the content responsibility work applies to family-oriented content on the main YouTube app as well.\\\\nSo all the work we are doing, be it the work we are doing to just remove bad content, raise up authoritative content, higher-quality content and reducing the spread of harming content, all applies everywhere and we\\'re really focused on it. Rewarding trusted creators is a big way we can help -- ensuring creators who produce content which is great for children, rewarding them, et cetera, are also important goals for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDaniel Salmon,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Maybe that\\'s for Ruth, but Sundar, please feel free to jump in. The first one here is based on a couple of comments you reminded us in your prepared remarks about YouTube, which was the inclusion of Originals and YouTube TV in the Google Preferred inventory. You\\'ve given us a little bit of color on direct response growth at YouTube over the last little while. Can we assume that those 2 additions were a bit of a boost to the brand advertising side of the business as that\\'s more inventory available for that sort of high-quality type of brand orientation that TV advertisers are looking for? \\\\nAnd then just second, coming back to Google Marketing Live, notwithstanding your comments, Ruth, that it takes some time for products to be adopted. Are there maybe 1 or 2 out of all of those announcements there that you would highlight as being potentially particularly material over the longer term?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the first stuff in terms of YouTube for brand, I would say it\\'s more secular across the platform promoting higher-quality content. Our work on brand safety, content responsibility adds up to it. Also, creators just generating better content. I think all have played a part. And as I would say, it\\'s more crosscutting. \\\\nOn the second thing, on GML, in terms of things we were excited about. To me, be it discovery ads and gallery ads, I mean, they\\'re both pushing us towards mobile-first, visually rich, immersive ad formats, which also offers a really great user experience. So I think I\\'m excited about changes like that, and I think they have the potential.\\\\nThere is advertiser excitement. But as Ruth mentioned, it\\'s early days. Anything we roll out now takes time to play out, but we definitely see excitement there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Former Director & Senior Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, first is for Sundar. I think earlier, Ruth had mentioned the importance of machine learning for driving growth in the quarter and I\\'m sure in many recent quarters. I believe many have kind of a hard time understanding exactly what that means. I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and advertisers. And then, secondly, for Ruth, in terms of the Sites TAC. I know there are a lot of variables that go in the changes in Sites TAC. But when you look at the puts and takes, how do you see that kind of trending over the next year or 2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          For us, machine learning plays a critical role across both the consumer user experience and part of ads, too. Generally, using machine learning to simplify things for advertisers and make campaigns easier and give them better insights is where we see a lot of benefit on the ad side. So for example, processing complex datasets and giving back sophisticated, real-time insights really helps make a difference. And also, on the front end, for marketers, helping them find the right creator for every moment, helping them manage bidding in real time. And so every step in the consumer journey, I think machine learning is just making things more efficient, more easier to use and driving productivity for them. So that\\'s what plays out through our systems.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And in terms of the TAC rate. As we\\'ve talked about previously, the growth in mobile does put upward pressure on the Sites TAC rate, and that was the primary driver of the year-on-year increase in the second quarter. And we do expect the underlying trend to continue given the ongoing growth in mobile.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColin Alan Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          A couple for me as well. First off, as you embrace more commerce and payments on the platform, broadly speaking, along with the new ad formats you\\'ve talked about, can you also talk about what role take rates might play in terms of future initiatives in revenue growth? And then secondly, on Assistant and Duplex, in terms of near-term search innovation, I wonder if you could characterize how important that is in terms of the momentum you\\'re seeing and longer term how this might impact platform monetization.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the first question, I think it\\'s a good question. There\\'s a lot of discovery that happens across Google\\'s properties and -- including Search and YouTube. And so anything we can do to make sure users have a better experience when they are interested in transacting will have a big role. So there\\'s a lot more work underway to make sure payments work better. Sign in works better. Payments works better. And all of that, I think, will be -- over the long term will be drivers, drivers because it improves the overall user experience, especially for commercial queries.\\\\nIn terms of Assistant and Duplex, I mean for us, Assistant is where we can clearly see we can really push our goal of being more helpful to users, helping them get things done, including things that matter in the real world. And so that\\'s what we are focused on. And if we get that right, just like with Search, there are many things which users want to get done which do have commercial intent to them. And I think that\\'s the value-creation opportunity as well. But we are focused on making sure the user experience constantly gets better, and we are investing to get there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJustin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sundar, there\\'s been a lot of regulatory news lately, especially from the DOJ. Just wondering how you think about a more intense regulatory environment, getting a lot of questions. I\\'m wondering if you think about that really affecting Google operations. And then, Ruth, definitely nice acceleration across the board. Of course, Europe accelerated as well. When you think about GDPR implementation last year and you\\'re lapping that, is that helping Europe at all? Or was there really no impact from GDPR?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the regulatory question, we understand that there will be scrutiny. We are -- we will engage constructively. It\\'s not new to us. We have participated in these processes before. Today, we do operate under a lot of regulation, be it on privacy, be it on competition, be it on copyright, intellectual property, et cetera. And even in the U.S., we have engaged in the process before. To the extent we have to answer questions, we will do so constructively. And to the extent there are concerns, we\\'ll address them as well.\\\\nBut I think for me, it\\'s important that we stay focused on building helpful products to users and that\\'s the value we ultimately provide our users. And I think that\\'s what we\\'ll stay focused on as a company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And in terms of GDPR, we did implement late in the second quarter of 2018. We think it\\'s obviously a critical area of making sure we get it right. That said, the overall impact of regulation on consumers and businesses is still playing out, and we\\'re very focused on making sure we\\'re doing what\\'s best for our users and ensuring we\\'re compliant with the law, not based on any potential revenue impact.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Adam Sandler,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Equity Research & Senior Internet Analyst    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          If I can squeeze 2 in real quick. Ruth, the Google segment operating profit was up 16%. That\\'s the highest growth rate in about 2 years. So I guess how should we think about the cadence of that relative to your comments about the headcount growth and the Looker acquisition looking forward? \\\\nAnd then, Sundar, at I/O, you mentioned that the active Android installed base is now over 2.5 billion. That\\'s up about 10% year-on-year, and a lot of that is coming from emerging markets. So I guess just big picture, how do we think about the growth rates that you can sustain in mobile search revenue relative to that 10% active Android growth rate?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks for that. I tried to enumerate the things as we\\'re looking forward very much to your question. Our overall long-term investment thesis is unchanged. We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing growth we see across Google in particular, as we\\'re talking about in Search, while we\\'re also investing to build new businesses, most notably in Cloud, as we\\'ve talked a lot about here today. \\\\nAnd across all of Alphabet, we do continue to benefit from machine learning, that\\'s both OpEx and CapEx. And as we both commented, given the opportunities we see with the application of machine learning across the business, we are continuing to invest. \\\\nOur lens on the pace of investing does have 3 facets in it. First is investing at the appropriate pace to support long-term earnings growth. And then we were very focused, second, on optimizing investments within each product area. And finally, as we\\'ve talked about, investing to support operational excellence. \\\\nBut the mega point is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we\\'re continuing to invest, which is why in opening comments, I wanted to make sure to call out what we\\'re seeing with respect to ongoing investments in -- across the business, the increases in headcount and the reasons for them, the benefits of those investments as well as sales and marketing and the fact that, that is back-half-loaded and back-half-weighted, I should say.\\\\nAnd so tried to lay out the relevant points for you to ensure that we make it very clear. We are committed to continuing to invest for what we see as long-term opportunities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSundar Pichai,  Google LLC - CEO    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And on the mobile question. We are definitely investing in Android with a focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience continues to evolve. In terms of the mobile experience, I still think from a user standpoint, there\\'s a lot of information overload. So being helpful to users and helping them navigate it, be it Search, Assistant, Maps and YouTube, I think we are focused on the opportunities there. \\\\nAnd in terms of the next billion users, there\\'s a lot of headroom there over time and we are focused on. That\\'s why we take efforts like Android Go seriously. We are constantly working hard to lower the barrier so that more people can benefit from being online and participating in the digital economy. And so it will continue to be a focus for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\\'d like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nEllen West,  Alphabet Inc. - VP of IR    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Thank you, and have a good afternoon.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ruth Cotter, Chief Human Resources Officer, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [2]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you and welcome to AMD's second-quarter conference call. By now you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and slides. If you've not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at IOR.AMD.com.\\nParticipants on today's conference call are Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on AMD.com.\\nI'd like to take the opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Lisa Su will present at the Pacific Crest Global Technology Leadership Forum on the 9th of August in Colorado. Raja Koduri, Senior Vice President and Chief Architect, Radeon Technologies Group, will attend the Jefferies Semiconductor Hardware and Communications Infrastructure Summit in Chicago on August 30.\\nMark Papermaster, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, will present at the Deutsche Bank's Technology Conference on September 13 in Las Vegas. And our third-quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, September 16, 2016. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that second quarter -- that the second-quarter 2016 was a 13-week quarter, and we expect to record our extra week in the fourth quarter of 2016.\\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.\\nAdditionally, please note we will be referring to non-GAAP figures during this call except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary that we've posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.AMD.com.\\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 2016.\\nNow with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you, Ruth. And good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our ongoing focus on diversifying our business model and delivering great products is creating solid market and financial momentum. Looking at the second-quarter specifically, strong semicustom demand and better-than-seasonal graphic sales drove a 23% sequential revenue increase and our return to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\nWe also recorded our first full quarter licensing gain from our China server JV, THATIC, and improved our balance sheet with cash proceeds from the formation of our ATMP joint venture, with NFME. Looking at our Computing and Graphic segment, revenue decreased 5% sequentially, as stronger-than-seasonal GPU sales were offset by a decline in desktop processor sales.\\nFirst-half 2016 GPU sales increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, as the investments we have been making to develop leadership graphics hardware, software and drivers, combined with new marketing campaigns, are paying off.\\nOur strong second-quarter graphics performance was capped by the launch of our new Polaris based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June, which helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014. The Radeon RX family resets expectations around the experiences and features gamers now want in a mainstream GPU.\\nWe are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desk top GPUs, and Polaris based notebooks from our OEM customers. We also delivered our third straight quarter of sequential professionals graphics revenue growth and believe we gained share driven by increased adoption of FirePro graphics by OEMs as well as several cloud data center GPU compute wins.\\nIn client, mobile APUs sales increased for the third straight quarter, partially offsetting decreased desktop processor sales led by channel softness in China. Shipments of our recently launched seventh generation APUs are ramping well and outpacing sales of our six-generation APUs at this point in their lifecycle.\\nMore than 25 new seventh generation APU systems, including several premium designs, are expected to be widely available in the coming months from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, providing us with confidence in this part of our business as we enter the seasonally stronger second half of the year.\\nTurning to our enterprise embedded and semicustom segment, our 59% sequential revenue increase is the largest since our first full quarter of semicustom products shipments in 2013. As in the previous two years, we expect semicustom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semicustom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.\\nLast quarter at E3, Microsoft announced two new members of the Xbox One family powered by AMD. The Xbox One S is the slimmest Xbox console ever, and the first to support HDR. The system is expected to go on sale in the coming weeks. Microsoft also announced their next-generation game console, code-named Project Scorpio, for the 2017 holidays.\\nProject Scorpios is designed to be fully compatible with existing Xbox One software, while leveraging AMD's leadership gaming technologies to create more immersive 4K and VR gaming experiences. Project Scorpio is one of the semicustom design wins we communicated previously.\\nOur next generation Zen processor products passed several key milestones in the quarter as well. I'm excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers' labs.\\nWe are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.\\nIn closing, over the last 18 months, we have been diligently executing our strategic plan to improve our financial performance by delivering great products, strengthening our customer relationships, and simplifying our business. In the past six months alone, we released our game-changing Polaris architecture, completed our ATMP JV transaction, announced a JV and IP licensing transaction with THATIC, and returned to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\nWhile we recognize we have more work to do, we believe that, based on the ongoing ramps of our semicustom SoCs, Polaris GPUs, and seventh generation APUs, we can deliver full-year revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on delivering our road map of high performance products and technologies, including Zen and our next generation Vega GPU architecture that can drive long-term growth.\\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second-quarter financial performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [4]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was a strong quarter, punctuated by better-than-expected financial performance, driven by demand for our semicustom SoCs and the closure of our ATMP joint venture transaction with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, which bolstered our cash position.\\nSecond-quarter revenue was $1.027 billion, up 23% sequentially, driven by higher sales of semicustom SoCs. The year-over-year revenue increase was 9% with higher sales in both reportable segments. Gross margin was 31%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of semicustom SoCs sales.\\nOperating expenses were $342 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased marketing investments. We also recognized a $26 million licensing gain associated with our JV with THATIC, and restructuring credits of $7 million, primarily related to facilities. We are pleased to report operating income of $3 million this quarter.\\nNet loss was $40 million with loss per share of $0.05, calculated using 794 million basic shares in the quarter. We recorded a pretax gain of $150 million related to the ATMP JV transaction, an equity loss of $3 million based on our 15% ownership stake, and taxes of $27 million related to the JV transaction. Adjusted EBITDA was a positive $36 million compared to negative $22 million in the prior quarter.\\nNow turning to the business segments -- Computing and Graphics revenue was $435 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of client desktop processors and chipsets. Revenue was up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by higher client notebook Processor and Graphics sales.\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating loss was $81 million compared to $70 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower revenue. Enterprise, embedded and semicustom revenue was $592 million, up 59% from the prior quarter and 5% higher than the prior year, driven by higher semicustom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from [$16 million] in the prior quarter, driven by higher revenue and a $26 million IP licensing gain compared to a licensing gain of $7 million in the first quarter.\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter. Inventory was $743 million, up $68 million or 10% from the prior quarter, and higher than guided, in support of expected higher semicustom sales in the third quarter.\\nIn the second quarter, we recorded a $62 million investment on our balance sheet related to our 15% ownership stake in the ATMP JV. Total wafer purchases from GlobalFoundries in the second quarter were 75 million and year-to-date, we have purchased 259 million.\\nDebt as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, and includes total borrowings of $226 million on our secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow in the second quarter was negative $106 million compared to a negative $68 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the inventory build in support of strong second-half revenue.\\nNow turning to the outlook, which is based on a 13-week fiscal quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by our graphics and semicustom products, including the ramp of new semicustom business; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million, due to an increase in R&D investments; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $22 million to maintain non-GAAP operating profitability; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes or other -- and other to be approximately $45 million; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately flat; and inventory to be approximately $700 million. And lastly, for the full-year 2016, we expect low-single digit revenue growth year-over-year.\\nIn closing, we are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. We launched exciting new products in the second quarter, with more expected to come to help drive strong revenue growth and improved financial performance in the third quarter. We recognize there's a lot more work to be done to return AMD to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation, and look forward to continuing our progress over the coming quarters.\\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [5]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you, Devinder. Operator, if you could poll the audience please for a question-and-answer session?\\n\\n\\n================================================================================\\nQuestions and Answers\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [1]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Operator Instructions) David Wong, Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [2]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMy first question -- can you give us any detail on the ramp in dollar terms of revenues from new semicustom products in the September/December quarters, and what the seasonal pattern of these products might be?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSure, David. This is Lisa. Let me start with that. So, our semicustom business overall, we see as strong for the year. I think the predominant business is the current generation game consoles, and as they ramp into the second half and the stronger holiday season.\\nWe expect the seasonality of semicustoms to be similar to prior years. We'll see a peak in the third quarter and a decline in the fourth quarter, and we will see the new business layer in starting in the third quarter. But I don't expect that to change the seasonality pattern. So, we are building up for a strong holiday season overall.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [4]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Lisa. And since the launch of your Radeon 480 graphics product end of last month, have you been able to supply to demand for the cards? Or if not, when do you expect demand will rise to match supply?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [5]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes. So, David, we're very pleased with the launch of the Radeon RX 480. We had good supply at major retailers on launch day. Since then, the demand has continued to be strong and so some of the retailers are out of supply. We do see that the 14 LPP yields are good and we're ramping up production steeply.\\nSo we expect that will equalize as we go through the quarter. We're also very soon going to launch the rest of the Radeon RX family. And so you'll see three products in the third quarter in terms of overall product momentum.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [6]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGreat. Thanks very much.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [7]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks, David.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [8]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMark Lipacis, Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [9]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks for taking my question. First one -- Lisa, maybe for you -- the China licensing deal was -- I thought it was creative and fascinating. Can you characterize kind of the pipeline of IP deals that you have or the technology deals? Is this it? Or do you have more in the pipe? Can you talk about timing or the types of deals you might be working on?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [10]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSure, Mark. So the China JV, as you said, we announced it last quarter and it's now in operation. It's actually going well, so we're on track for some of the important milestone deliveries that we had.\\nIn terms of the overall pipeline, I would say we have a nice set of interesting opportunities. They're -- very much, as you know, they take a while for them to come to fruition, but we feel good about the model which is partnering with folks that need high-performance technology. And we'll continue to work those deals as we go through the next couple of quarters.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [11]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Great. And I'll follow-up if I may. I was hoping that you could just help me with the accounting of the semicustom design wins. So if I remember properly, there was two that you expect in the back half of this year, and then one -- I thought it was the first half of next year.\\nSo Scorpio is one of those three? But that's next year; so that's the one for next year?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [12]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes, let me help you out with the accounting -- I know that we've had several different pieces of information on the semicustom new design wins. So what we said is we'll have a total of three semicustom new design wins that will account for about -- let's call it $1.5 billion of revenue approximately over the next three to four years.\\nWe are starting the ramp of new business this coming quarter, this third quarter, and that will be one of the semicustom design wins. Scorpio is also a design win, and that, as our customer said, will be in 2017. And we'll give you more information about the third one as we have more visibility.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [13]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAnd do you have more design wins that you just haven't announced or mentioned timing of?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [14]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWell, we're trying to get out a little bit of the counting game, but I think overall, we're pleased with the semicustom pipeline. I think some of the questions that we've been asked are, do we believe we have design wins outside of game consoles, and the answer is yes. We have design wins outside of game consoles. I think we view the pipeline as good, and it's a business model that works well with our high-performance technology plans and our SoC capabilities.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [15]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you. That's very helpful.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [16]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks, Mark.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [17]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMatt Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [18]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks for taking my questions. Lisa, I have a couple of questions on Zen. You gave some color in your prepared remarks about server opportunities for Zen starting in the first half of next year. Maybe you could give us a little color on potentially what markets you are going after there, where you see the opportunities?\\nIt seems to me that a lot of different moving parts in the cloud market with open power and ARM, and then custom CPUs from Intel, but a pretty big enterprise space that's x86 captive for you guys to go after. So I would just be interested to see what the strategy is going forward there and where the design wins might come from?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [19]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSure, Matt. So, yes, let me give you a little bit of color how we see it. First of all, look, Zen is a brand-new CPU design and we had very ambitious goals for it. And given where we are today, it's actually coming up very well.\\nWe've demoed both desktop systems, and now we have server systems working in both our labs and our customers' labs. I would say as the progress of Zen is -- goes along in terms of validation, the customer interest has increased. And so, while we did close a number of design wins in the second quarter and we have a number more in the pipeline, as we go into the third quarter and more widespread availability.\\nOur view is, Zen is a general-purpose server architecture that can play in many different places. So you mentioned the cloud. I think that's certainly one target market given the growth there. We also see there are workloads that would be particularly -- fit well for sort of the performance areas that we're targeting. I think enterprise is also again very much a target area for Zen.\\nWhat we are looking for again is ensuring that we have a very high quality launch, and so we're working very closely with customers to make sure that we run their workloads and demonstrate the performance improvement that we expect. But as I said overall, it's going well, and we continue to work with customers to ensure that they see the benefits of Zen and working with AMD.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [20]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you for the color and it's good to hear. I guess another question on Zen more in the PC market -- because I think your prepared remarks focused a bit more on server -- but maybe you could give us a little bit of an update in the timing of desktop and notebook potential launches.\\nIt just seems to me going into the holiday season that it's still a little unclear as to where Zen is going to land relative to holiday ramps in the Western market and to Chinese New Year. So any color around that would be really helpful. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [21]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes. No, that's a fair question, Matt. So we have been very focused on the server launch for first half of 2017. Desktop should launch before that. In terms of true volume availability, I believe it will be in the first quarter of 2017. We may ship some limited volume towards the end of the fourth quarter, based on how bring-up goes and the customer readiness.\\nBut again, if I look overall at what we are trying to do, I think the desktop product is very well-positioned for that high-end desktop segment, that enthusiast segment, in both channel and OEM, which is very much a segment that AMD knows well. And so that's where we would focus -- on desktop.\\nYou should expect a notebook version of Zen with integrated graphics in 2017, and that development is going on as well. And so I think it's just a time of a lot of activity around the Zen and the different Zen product families.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [22]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you very much. Congratulations on the return to profitability.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [23]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks, Matt.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [24]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [25]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [26]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks for taking my questions. I was looking at the implied guidance for Q4. You said the -- I guess for the full year, up low single digits. So, I mean, call it 3%. But it would imply Q4 down 16%/17% sequentially, and actually down on an absolute basis, lower than I would've thought. I think Q4 also has an extra week in it.\\nI was wondering if you could give us, I guess, some color on how you see the drivers, I guess, for seasonality going from Q3 to Q4 across both of the businesses, given that, I guess, the trajectory of the different product launches that we have in the back half? Like, how do you come to that number?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [27]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSure. Stacy, maybe I'll start and see if Devinder would like to add to it. So, look, our -- when we started the year, our expectation is that we would grow revenue in 2016 versus 2015, but we were coming off of a very low base in the first quarter. So we've been pleased with how it played out certainly in our second-quarter revenue and the third quarter revenue guidance.\\nOverall, the businesses are performing well, so we do expect both Computing and Graphics and EEFC to both grow for the year. I think the semicustom business is the large driver of the fourth quarter in terms of just how we see the overall business playing out. But the Computing and Graphics business is playing out as you might expect.\\nSo the second half should be seasonally higher, certainly with Polaris, and as we launch broader availability across the product line, as well as the seventh generation APUs as they go into back-to-school and holiday. So that's the way we should think about it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [28]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at your notebook shipments in the quarter. So they were up again sequentially -- I think they were up double digits in Q1; I think they were up in Q4 as well. So three quarters in a row of sequential increase. Obviously off a low base as well.\\nBut how confident are you -- like what's driving that? Is this -- is it actually sort of a sell-out that's actually driving the demand? Or is this sell-in into the channel? And how should we think about that potentially normalizing?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [29]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes, so if you're talking about the notebook computing business, actually we are kind of pleased with how it performed. So if you look at it, overall, the -- our OEM customers have adopted our technologies, so we see that across both notebook and desktop, but presumably notebook.\\nWe are also making progress in commercial, and that was a very important initiative over the past five or six quarters. And so that's been nice to stabilize the business. And again, I don't believe it's a sell-in phenomenon. Actually it's consumption share that we see increasing. And I think we have a reasonable opportunity to add to that in the second half of the year. But it's really around our products in the platforms that we're putting together with the OEMs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [30]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGot it. If I could ask one more really quick. I was just a little bit surprised at how much your wafer purchases at GlobalFoundries came down quarter-over-quarter, given the increase in notebooks as well as the timing of the Polaris launch. Any -- what -- should we read anything into that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [31]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nI think basically the purchases of the wafers are in line with product demand and mix of business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the other day we purchased about [$260 million] of wafers, and we are getting into the back half of the year, which as you can see, with our revenue guidance in Q3, is pretty strong.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [32]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you, guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [33]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn Pitzer, Credit Suisse Group.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [34]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on orchestrating the turnaround. I guess, Lisa, my first question, I would kind of like to get your view on the news earlier this week around Softbank and ARM. You are sort of in a unique position because you are both kind of a partner with ARM as an ARM licensee. But if you look at your custom silicon business, especially on the x86 architecture, you could make the argument that you're a little bit of a competitor as well.\\nSo I'm kind of curious to know how you see kind of the reaction to that from a customer perspective? And does that change your view of how you might be able to monetize your own IP in the future?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [35]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn, thanks for the question. Look, I think it's a very interesting deal -- the ARM SoftBank deal. I think we have a lot of respect for ARM; they are a close partner. I'm not sure we would call them a competitor. Overall, they are a partner.\\nAs it relates to how we think about our IP, we really believe that our IP, particularly the high performance element of it on the microprocessor and the graphic side, is very unique, and in some sense, there are very few places in the industry where you have access to it. I think the applications that need it, whether you are talking about consumer applications or enterprise cloud applications, are growing. And so it's an opportunity for us to look for larger markets to monetize beyond just our own products.\\nAnd that's, in general, the way we think about IP monetization. We have a set of products that is very important to our business model, but our IP can go further than our products themselves. And so we would continue to look for opportunities to monetize our IP.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [36]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAnd again, I apologize if I missed this -- you commented on sort of your expectations for GPUs going into Q3 and for semicustom. How do you view the PC outlook within your total outlook above ATM? And I've got a quick follow-on.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [37]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSure. So let me talk about the PC market overall. I think our view of the PC market is pretty similar to others in the industry. We would say, overall for 2016, high-single digit decline. We have seen some positive signals, and we saw some positive data points from IDC earlier the last week. And then we saw a little bit of pickup in consumption in June from our OEM customers. But again, that was compared to -- let's call it a soft April/May.\\nOur view is OEM business looks okay. The channel for us is still weaker than we would like, and that's our view of the PC business. Even in that framework, we believe we can grow our Computing and Graphics business on the strength of the products. The Graphics products, we've talked about, as they ramp in the second half of the year. And on the Computing side as well, I think we have a number of new platforms, and back-to-school and holiday are important for us. So that's the way would characterize PCs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [38]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSo, Lisa, not to put words in your mouth, but for Q3, PC's up but perhaps not up as much as seasonal? Is that the best way to think about it within your guide?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [39]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nI would say roughly seasonal -- roughly seasonal.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [40]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThat's helpful. And then lastly, guys, I apologize, but Devinder, now that you've got revenue growth behind you and you've got some momentum here, how do we think about the gross margin progression from here and kind of the puts and takes? And I know there's lot of different dynamics there, including the mix of semicustom. But from these levels, how should we think about gross margin progression over the next, call it, two to four quarters?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [41]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes, John, I think the way you think about it is, it is the mix of business, so that's a good observation. But also you see us making continuing investments in our roadmap in graphics and in other areas, and we believe that will help us improve the gross margin. And then as you look out longer-term, as you observe -- get beyond a couple of quarters and get into 2017, we do have the Zen product introduction coming up. We also have a product in the pro graphics area, and that should drive even higher gross margins compared to where we are today, given the mix will get better with those products.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [42]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks. Well, thanks, guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [43]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks, John.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [44]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRoss Seymore, Deutsche Bank.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [45]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks for taking my question. This is Sidney Ho asking -- calling in for Ross. Just follow up to -- with the last question by focusing on third quarter, you guided third-quarter gross margin to be flat, but the profile seem -- of revenue growth seems to be -- would suggest gross margin should decline on a mix adjusted basis.\\nHow should we think about gross margin by segment in Q3? What are some of the moving parts? And maybe follow-up to that, do you expect the gross margin of the new custom design wins ramping this quarter to have better or worse margins than your game console business?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [46]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes, I think that's well-put. I mean if you look overall when we have a higher mix of semicustom business, typically the gross margin is lower since the business model on the semicustom side has for the lower margin just the way the model is constructed. So keeping it flat at 31% with the guide in Q3 was variable in Q2. We were pretty pleased with that. And I think you're seeing some of the strength underlying the non-semicustom business is allowing us to keep it flat quarter-on-quarter.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [47]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Great. And then my follow-up question is -- you guys talked about the Zen products at Computex and it's on track for launching in the first half of 2017. Can you talk about the impact on R&D expense and maybe on gross margin on the preparation of this launch over the next few quarters? And if you hit your revenue plan that you have thought about, at what point do you need to start increasing OpEx from the $330 million to $350 million level?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [48]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe OpEx side of it, if I look at it from that standpoint, you have seen our OpEx actually go up; in Q3, we are guiding at the $350 million level with specific targeted investments we are making in key R&D areas and products, in particular the high performance roadmap that we have laid out. But we are also making some specific investments in the marketing area, given the new products that are coming out on the PC side as well as the GPU side, trying to attract end-users back to the AMD brand.\\nAnd I think you'll continue to see us do that. And that helps obviously with this new product underlying the better margins that you get with the fresh cycle, in particular with the new technology areas that we are putting our products in.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [49]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGreat. Maybe just one quick follow-up. For Q4 with an extra week in the fiscal quarter, should we expect OpEx to be at the high end of levels, that that will be enough -- that $350 million?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [50]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nI'm not prepared -- you know, one of the things about OpEx as I always say even if you look at Q3, the OpEx is up on a guided basis at $350 million, but very much as I always say, we manage the OpEx pretty tightly. We've done that over the last several years, and obviously it gets modulated somewhat by revenue. Q3, our revenue is up 18%, OpEx is at $350 million and we'll talk about Q4 when we gather here in about 90 days.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [51]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [52]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nI was also curious about GlobalFoundries being so low in Q2. And I guess have you guys finalized the 2016 wafer supply agreement? And can you talk more generally about which products -- how you are deciding which products are allocated to Global and TSMC? And is there anything that's exclusive to one or the other?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [54]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes, several parts to it. I mean the working relationship, as Lisa said, with GlobalFoundries is very good. We continue to work through the 2016 WSA and that's not finalized; we're in the process of negotiating that. In the meantime, we continue to get delivery of wafers for the products that we need in line with the product demand and mix of business. And relative to your -- which products from which foundry, we typically do not share the source of foundry for any of our wafers or products.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [55]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. That's fair. And then with regards to kind of thinking about next year's OpEx, when you look at the importance of a CPU that can attack the server market and can attack the high end of the sort of enthusiast CPU market, I guess I don't want you to necessarily be constrained by the R&D requirements of the last couple of years.\\nI mean, so how do you think about that? If you start to show some revenue traction, I mean, can you -- how much flexibility do you think there is on spending? I'm not asking for a number, but just qualitatively, how are you thinking about profitability versus investing in these opportunities next year?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [56]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJoe, I would say my engineers would be very happy to hear you say that. So look, I appreciate the question. I think you've seen -- and Devinder said this -- we're going to be disciplined in OpEx. And as this quarter was an important turning point for us, to return to operating profitability, I think we have a nice sort of a view into Q3.\\nWe will look for opportunities to ensure that we are strategically placing the big bets in R&D, and both on the CPU and the GPU side. For example, this year, we have ramped up our investments on the graphics side with the formation of the Radeon Technologies Group, and what we're doing in both hardware and software -- very significant investments.\\nAnd similarly on the CPU side as well. So, I think we take very seriously our commitments in terms of profitability, but we will invest in the future and we'll continue to look for opportunities to balance those in the right way.\\nI don't know, Devinder, if you want to add --?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [57]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNo, I think that's well-said. In 2017, obviously, as we get to the back half of the year, Q3 we have guided, we're getting to that -- get through Q3 and get into Q4. And at that point, we'll start thinking about where we want to place our bets as these are put in terms of the longer-term investments in 2017. Right now we're really focused on getting -- we got to non-GAAP operating profitability this quarter. We want to maintain that in Q3 and then we'll see what happens from there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [58]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGreat. Thank you very much.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [59]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nChristopher Danely, Citigroup.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [60]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis is Marco Chan calling on behalf of Chris Danely. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is, could you please update us on your expectations on the THATIC x86 server JV in China? Are there any potential legal risks with it, potentially Intel?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [61]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes. So relative to the server JV that we have with THATIC, as we stated before, we believe that our joint venture is operational. I think it's well underway. The technology that we're licensing is AMD technology, and so we don't have any issues relative to licensing. I think --\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [62]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes. If I may add, I mean, one thing on the update, I guess, if you look at the prepared remarks and the commentary for Q3 is, we now expect, based on technology transfer milestone completion, to recognize $22 million to authorize a gain in Q3 and approximately $75 million for the year, which is higher than what we had said previously when we said it was $52 million for the year. So you can see it's incremental and therefore, as Lisa said, things are operationally on track and we continue to meet our technology transfer milestones from a date standpoint.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [63]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThat's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up -- I know you guys mentioned PCs and Graphics segment should be up year-over-year. Could you guys get into more detail, maybe talk about each segment individually, your trends for PCs versus GPUs?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [64]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes, we don't usually go into granularity about the subsegments of the business. I think it's fair to say that our PC business has stabilized. And what we're seeing now is the opportunity, as we go into the seasonally stronger half of the year on both the PC side and graphics side, on top of that with some new product launches, we believe that we will end up growing year-over-year. But again, we don't usually guide to the details within the segment.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [65]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [66]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAmbrish Srivastava, BMO.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [67]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on your Project Scorpio comment. I think it's going to be launched in 2017. And I think you had significantly higher performance and support 4K and V. So how should we think about the pricing on ASP that compares to what you have indicated on the current generation game console platform?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [68]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes. So, again we don't -- we wouldn't disclose anything that's incrementally more than what our customer has disclosed. So I think Microsoft has talked about their goals with Project Scorpio. I think we are in support of those goals. Given the performance level, you would imagine that there's more capability on chip, but I wouldn't want to go more than that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [69]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. As a follow-up -- I think your competitor has launched a comparable mainstream product -- I think GeForce 10 6P, so given the absence of your maybe higher performance part launching maybe in the second half, so how should we think about the rest of the year on the demand on your graphics side?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [70]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes, we are feeling very good about our Polaris launch. This was our strategy from the beginning. I mean we laid out a strategy where we were going after the mainstream, and growth rate, really a new experience in terms of both capability and price point. And I think we've done that.\\nWe've also been very focused on DX 12 and our performance -- on new APIs like Vulcan. So we are happy with our competitiveness. I think it's played out as we thought it would do. Certainly our aspirations in GPU are to certainly have very competitive products across the entire product line. And so I've talked about working on Vega, which is the next generation high-end architecture.\\nBut in terms of our competitiveness, you know, we -- again, we've executed what we thought we were going to execute. And it seems like, from both customer reviews and analyst reviews, that it's pretty well-received by the market.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [71]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [72]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator, we'll take two more callers, please.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [73]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nIan Ing, MKM Partners.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [74]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes, thank you for fitting me in. So EESC -- looks like you achieved operating income same level as third quarter of last year but with $45 million lower revenue. So just wondering how you got more profitable in this segment, given these are both strong game console quarters and also you've got annual price declines in game consoles, I assume. Thanks.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [75]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nI think if you look at the profitability, you've got to remember that in the EESC segment, we also have other businesses embedded for one, and also the investment we are making for the enterprise side of it, for the data center product that's coming out in 2017. So the profitability -- you're right about the observation, but profitability depends upon obviously -- the largest business we have in there right now is the semicustom business, but also the investments on the OpEx standpoint that we make year-on-year. And we talked about the targeted investments we are making in some of the product areas.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [76]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Great. But these are relatively older products that are embedded into enterprise products at the moment then, it sounds like. Okay, great. And then my follow-on is -- you are at a one-year cadence for GPUs now. Could you talk about expectations on how last year's R9300 series winds down and how that plays out? It looks like in Q2, it was really just a lack of a pause ahead of a known refresh. And do you expect sort of a sharp wind-down at some point? Or is it more gradual?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [77]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nActually, Ian, that's a good observation. The 390 series or the 300 series overall actually did do okay in the second quarter. We were also wondering whether there would be a pause prior to a new generation. I think we see it as a very orderly transition; it's actually one of our better product transitions as we go from the 300 series over to the 400 series.\\nSo again, nothing very spectacular to report other than the sellthrough has continued -- the sellthrough was good in the second quarter. And we believe that it's an orderly transition of the inventory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [78]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay, great. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [79]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks, Ian.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [80]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Jaguar Bajwa from Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [81]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThanks for taking my question. Just a question on Q3. Could you just lay out which would be the fastest-growing sequential segment in Q3? Will that be the GPU business, CPU or semicustom? Thanks.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [82]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJaguar, I think what we would say is that our Q3 guidance is both semicustom and graphics will be the drivers of the sequential revenue growth.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [83]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Thanks. And then could you just give a bit more clarity around Vega timing? And also what do you expect to be your differentiation here versus what Nvidia has done with Pascal?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [84]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAgain, I think we'll talk more about the details of the Vega architecture in time, but certainly Vega is a high-performance GPU that will use high-bandwidth memory as part of it. So, I would leave the details for a more -- as we go -- get closer to the Vega launch date.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [85]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Well, maybe just one final one then. When we get into the server CPU cycle with Zen, should we expect any kind of contribution from an APU format with CPU plus Vega? Because we're seeing a lot of acceleration now in the data center. Do you think that could be a key product for you guys which maybe your competitors may not have, bringing an APU to the server market for high-performance servers?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [86]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYes, I think it's fair to say that we do believe we can combine high-performance CPU with the high-performance GPU. As we look at our GPU compute in general, sort of our both professionals graphics and server markets for GPU, I think that will increasingly become an area of focus for us as we continue to grow the graphics business.\\nSo I think the answer is yes. I mean, obviously, it will come in time, but it's an area where combining the two technologies makes a lot of sense.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [87]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [88]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [89]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator, that concludes the question-and-answer session. If you wouldn't mind wrapping up the call, please?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [90]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCertainly. That concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Before we begin, let me remind everyone that second quarter -- that the second-quarter 2016 was a 13-week quarter, and we expect to record our extra week in the fourth quarter of 2016.\\\\nToday\\'s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.\\\\nAdditionally, please note we will be referring to non-GAAP figures during this call except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary that we\\'ve posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.AMD.com.\\\\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements in today\\'s earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD\\'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 2016.\\\\nNow with that, I\\'d like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Ruth. And good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our ongoing focus on diversifying our business model and delivering great products is creating solid market and financial momentum. Looking at the second-quarter specifically, strong semicustom demand and better-than-seasonal graphic sales drove a 23% sequential revenue increase and our return to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWe also recorded our first full quarter licensing gain from our China server JV, THATIC, and improved our balance sheet with cash proceeds from the formation of our ATMP joint venture, with NFME. Looking at our Computing and Graphic segment, revenue decreased 5% sequentially, as stronger-than-seasonal GPU sales were offset by a decline in desktop processor sales.\\\\nFirst-half 2016 GPU sales increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, as the investments we have been making to develop leadership graphics hardware, software and drivers, combined with new marketing campaigns, are paying off.\\\\nOur strong second-quarter graphics performance was capped by the launch of our new Polaris based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June, which helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014. The Radeon RX family resets expectations around the experiences and features gamers now want in a mainstream GPU.\\\\nWe are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desk top GPUs, and Polaris based notebooks from our OEM customers. We also delivered our third straight quarter of sequential professionals graphics revenue growth and believe we gained share driven by increased adoption of FirePro graphics by OEMs as well as several cloud data center GPU compute wins.\\\\nIn client, mobile APUs sales increased for the third straight quarter, partially offsetting decreased desktop processor sales led by channel softness in China. Shipments of our recently launched seventh generation APUs are ramping well and outpacing sales of our six-generation APUs at this point in their lifecycle.\\\\nMore than 25 new seventh generation APU systems, including several premium designs, are expected to be widely available in the coming months from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, providing us with confidence in this part of our business as we enter the seasonally stronger second half of the year.\\\\nTurning to our enterprise embedded and semicustom segment, our 59% sequential revenue increase is the largest since our first full quarter of semicustom products shipments in 2013. As in the previous two years, we expect semicustom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semicustom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.\\\\nLast quarter at E3, Microsoft announced two new members of the Xbox One family powered by AMD. The Xbox One S is the slimmest Xbox console ever, and the first to support HDR. The system is expected to go on sale in the coming weeks. Microsoft also announced their next-generation game console, code-named Project Scorpio, for the 2017 holidays.\\\\nProject Scorpios is designed to be fully compatible with existing Xbox One software, while leveraging AMD\\'s leadership gaming technologies to create more immersive 4K and VR gaming experiences. Project Scorpio is one of the semicustom design wins we communicated previously.\\\\nOur next generation Zen processor products passed several key milestones in the quarter as well. I\\'m excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers\\' labs.\\\\nWe are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.\\\\nIn closing, over the last 18 months, we have been diligently executing our strategic plan to improve our financial performance by delivering great products, strengthening our customer relationships, and simplifying our business. In the past six months alone, we released our game-changing Polaris architecture, completed our ATMP JV transaction, announced a JV and IP licensing transaction with THATIC, and returned to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWhile we recognize we have more work to do, we believe that, based on the ongoing ramps of our semicustom SoCs, Polaris GPUs, and seventh generation APUs, we can deliver full-year revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on delivering our road map of high performance products and technologies, including Zen and our next generation Vega GPU architecture that can drive long-term growth.\\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second-quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was a strong quarter, punctuated by better-than-expected financial performance, driven by demand for our semicustom SoCs and the closure of our ATMP joint venture transaction with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, which bolstered our cash position.\\\\nSecond-quarter revenue was $1.027 billion, up 23% sequentially, driven by higher sales of semicustom SoCs. The year-over-year revenue increase was 9% with higher sales in both reportable segments. Gross margin was 31%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of semicustom SoCs sales.\\\\nOperating expenses were $342 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased marketing investments. We also recognized a $26 million licensing gain associated with our JV with THATIC, and restructuring credits of $7 million, primarily related to facilities. We are pleased to report operating income of $3 million this quarter.\\\\nNet loss was $40 million with loss per share of $0.05, calculated using 794 million basic shares in the quarter. We recorded a pretax gain of $150 million related to the ATMP JV transaction, an equity loss of $3 million based on our 15% ownership stake, and taxes of $27 million related to the JV transaction. Adjusted EBITDA was a positive $36 million compared to negative $22 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments -- Computing and Graphics revenue was $435 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of client desktop processors and chipsets. Revenue was up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by higher client notebook Processor and Graphics sales.\\\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating loss was $81 million compared to $70 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower revenue. Enterprise, embedded and semicustom revenue was $592 million, up 59% from the prior quarter and 5% higher than the prior year, driven by higher semicustom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from [$16 million] in the prior quarter, driven by higher revenue and a $26 million IP licensing gain compared to a licensing gain of $7 million in the first quarter.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter. Inventory was $743 million, up $68 million or 10% from the prior quarter, and higher than guided, in support of expected higher semicustom sales in the third quarter.\\\\nIn the second quarter, we recorded a $62 million investment on our balance sheet related to our 15% ownership stake in the ATMP JV. Total wafer purchases from GlobalFoundries in the second quarter were 75 million and year-to-date, we have purchased 259 million.\\\\nDebt as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, and includes total borrowings of $226 million on our secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow in the second quarter was negative $106 million compared to a negative $68 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the inventory build in support of strong second-half revenue.\\\\nNow turning to the outlook, which is based on a 13-week fiscal quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by our graphics and semicustom products, including the ramp of new semicustom business; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million, due to an increase in R&D investments; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $22 million to maintain non-GAAP operating profitability; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes or other -- and other to be approximately $45 million; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately flat; and inventory to be approximately $700 million. And lastly, for the full-year 2016, we expect low-single digit revenue growth year-over-year.\\\\nIn closing, we are pleased with the progress we\\'ve made this quarter. We launched exciting new products in the second quarter, with more expected to come to help drive strong revenue growth and improved financial performance in the third quarter. We recognize there\\'s a lot more work to be done to return AMD to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation, and look forward to continuing our progress over the coming quarters.\\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Devinder. Operator, if you could poll the audience please for a question-and-answer session?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) David Wong, Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMy first question -- can you give us any detail on the ramp in dollar terms of revenues from new semicustom products in the September/December quarters, and what the seasonal pattern of these products might be?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, David. This is Lisa. Let me start with that. So, our semicustom business overall, we see as strong for the year. I think the predominant business is the current generation game consoles, and as they ramp into the second half and the stronger holiday season.\\\\nWe expect the seasonality of semicustoms to be similar to prior years. We\\'ll see a peak in the third quarter and a decline in the fourth quarter, and we will see the new business layer in starting in the third quarter. But I don\\'t expect that to change the seasonality pattern. So, we are building up for a strong holiday season overall.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Lisa. And since the launch of your Radeon 480 graphics product end of last month, have you been able to supply to demand for the cards? Or if not, when do you expect demand will rise to match supply?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So, David, we\\'re very pleased with the launch of the Radeon RX 480. We had good supply at major retailers on launch day. Since then, the demand has continued to be strong and so some of the retailers are out of supply. We do see that the 14 LPP yields are good and we\\'re ramping up production steeply.\\\\nSo we expect that will equalize as we go through the quarter. We\\'re also very soon going to launch the rest of the Radeon RX family. And so you\\'ll see three products in the third quarter in terms of overall product momentum.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Thanks very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, David.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis, Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. First one -- Lisa, maybe for you -- the China licensing deal was -- I thought it was creative and fascinating. Can you characterize kind of the pipeline of IP deals that you have or the technology deals? Is this it? Or do you have more in the pipe? Can you talk about timing or the types of deals you might be working on?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Mark. So the China JV, as you said, we announced it last quarter and it\\'s now in operation. It\\'s actually going well, so we\\'re on track for some of the important milestone deliveries that we had.\\\\nIn terms of the overall pipeline, I would say we have a nice set of interesting opportunities. They\\'re -- very much, as you know, they take a while for them to come to fruition, but we feel good about the model which is partnering with folks that need high-performance technology. And we\\'ll continue to work those deals as we go through the next couple of quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. And I\\'ll follow-up if I may. I was hoping that you could just help me with the accounting of the semicustom design wins. So if I remember properly, there was two that you expect in the back half of this year, and then one -- I thought it was the first half of next year.\\\\nSo Scorpio is one of those three? But that\\'s next year; so that\\'s the one for next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, let me help you out with the accounting -- I know that we\\'ve had several different pieces of information on the semicustom new design wins. So what we said is we\\'ll have a total of three semicustom new design wins that will account for about -- let\\'s call it $1.5 billion of revenue approximately over the next three to four years.\\\\nWe are starting the ramp of new business this coming quarter, this third quarter, and that will be one of the semicustom design wins. Scorpio is also a design win, and that, as our customer said, will be in 2017. And we\\'ll give you more information about the third one as we have more visibility.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd do you have more design wins that you just haven\\'t announced or mentioned timing of?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, we\\'re trying to get out a little bit of the counting game, but I think overall, we\\'re pleased with the semicustom pipeline. I think some of the questions that we\\'ve been asked are, do we believe we have design wins outside of game consoles, and the answer is yes. We have design wins outside of game consoles. I think we view the pipeline as good, and it\\'s a business model that works well with our high-performance technology plans and our SoC capabilities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. That\\'s very helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Mark.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my questions. Lisa, I have a couple of questions on Zen. You gave some color in your prepared remarks about server opportunities for Zen starting in the first half of next year. Maybe you could give us a little color on potentially what markets you are going after there, where you see the opportunities?\\\\nIt seems to me that a lot of different moving parts in the cloud market with open power and ARM, and then custom CPUs from Intel, but a pretty big enterprise space that\\'s x86 captive for you guys to go after. So I would just be interested to see what the strategy is going forward there and where the design wins might come from?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Matt. So, yes, let me give you a little bit of color how we see it. First of all, look, Zen is a brand-new CPU design and we had very ambitious goals for it. And given where we are today, it\\'s actually coming up very well.\\\\nWe\\'ve demoed both desktop systems, and now we have server systems working in both our labs and our customers\\' labs. I would say as the progress of Zen is -- goes along in terms of validation, the customer interest has increased. And so, while we did close a number of design wins in the second quarter and we have a number more in the pipeline, as we go into the third quarter and more widespread availability.\\\\nOur view is, Zen is a general-purpose server architecture that can play in many different places. So you mentioned the cloud. I think that\\'s certainly one target market given the growth there. We also see there are workloads that would be particularly -- fit well for sort of the performance areas that we\\'re targeting. I think enterprise is also again very much a target area for Zen.\\\\nWhat we are looking for again is ensuring that we have a very high quality launch, and so we\\'re working very closely with customers to make sure that we run their workloads and demonstrate the performance improvement that we expect. But as I said overall, it\\'s going well, and we continue to work with customers to ensure that they see the benefits of Zen and working with AMD.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you for the color and it\\'s good to hear. I guess another question on Zen more in the PC market -- because I think your prepared remarks focused a bit more on server -- but maybe you could give us a little bit of an update in the timing of desktop and notebook potential launches.\\\\nIt just seems to me going into the holiday season that it\\'s still a little unclear as to where Zen is going to land relative to holiday ramps in the Western market and to Chinese New Year. So any color around that would be really helpful. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. No, that\\'s a fair question, Matt. So we have been very focused on the server launch for first half of 2017. Desktop should launch before that. In terms of true volume availability, I believe it will be in the first quarter of 2017. We may ship some limited volume towards the end of the fourth quarter, based on how bring-up goes and the customer readiness.\\\\nBut again, if I look overall at what we are trying to do, I think the desktop product is very well-positioned for that high-end desktop segment, that enthusiast segment, in both channel and OEM, which is very much a segment that AMD knows well. And so that\\'s where we would focus -- on desktop.\\\\nYou should expect a notebook version of Zen with integrated graphics in 2017, and that development is going on as well. And so I think it\\'s just a time of a lot of activity around the Zen and the different Zen product families.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much. Congratulations on the return to profitability.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Matt.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my questions. I was looking at the implied guidance for Q4. You said the -- I guess for the full year, up low single digits. So, I mean, call it 3%. But it would imply Q4 down 16%/17% sequentially, and actually down on an absolute basis, lower than I would\\'ve thought. I think Q4 also has an extra week in it.\\\\nI was wondering if you could give us, I guess, some color on how you see the drivers, I guess, for seasonality going from Q3 to Q4 across both of the businesses, given that, I guess, the trajectory of the different product launches that we have in the back half? Like, how do you come to that number?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. Stacy, maybe I\\'ll start and see if Devinder would like to add to it. So, look, our -- when we started the year, our expectation is that we would grow revenue in 2016 versus 2015, but we were coming off of a very low base in the first quarter. So we\\'ve been pleased with how it played out certainly in our second-quarter revenue and the third quarter revenue guidance.\\\\nOverall, the businesses are performing well, so we do expect both Computing and Graphics and EEFC to both grow for the year. I think the semicustom business is the large driver of the fourth quarter in terms of just how we see the overall business playing out. But the Computing and Graphics business is playing out as you might expect.\\\\nSo the second half should be seasonally higher, certainly with Polaris, and as we launch broader availability across the product line, as well as the seventh generation APUs as they go into back-to-school and holiday. So that\\'s the way we should think about it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at your notebook shipments in the quarter. So they were up again sequentially -- I think they were up double digits in Q1; I think they were up in Q4 as well. So three quarters in a row of sequential increase. Obviously off a low base as well.\\\\nBut how confident are you -- like what\\'s driving that? Is this -- is it actually sort of a sell-out that\\'s actually driving the demand? Or is this sell-in into the channel? And how should we think about that potentially normalizing?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, so if you\\'re talking about the notebook computing business, actually we are kind of pleased with how it performed. So if you look at it, overall, the -- our OEM customers have adopted our technologies, so we see that across both notebook and desktop, but presumably notebook.\\\\nWe are also making progress in commercial, and that was a very important initiative over the past five or six quarters. And so that\\'s been nice to stabilize the business. And again, I don\\'t believe it\\'s a sell-in phenomenon. Actually it\\'s consumption share that we see increasing. And I think we have a reasonable opportunity to add to that in the second half of the year. But it\\'s really around our products in the platforms that we\\'re putting together with the OEMs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. If I could ask one more really quick. I was just a little bit surprised at how much your wafer purchases at GlobalFoundries came down quarter-over-quarter, given the increase in notebooks as well as the timing of the Polaris launch. Any -- what -- should we read anything into that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think basically the purchases of the wafers are in line with product demand and mix of business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the other day we purchased about [$260 million] of wafers, and we are getting into the back half of the year, which as you can see, with our revenue guidance in Q3, is pretty strong.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer, Credit Suisse Group.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on orchestrating the turnaround. I guess, Lisa, my first question, I would kind of like to get your view on the news earlier this week around Softbank and ARM. You are sort of in a unique position because you are both kind of a partner with ARM as an ARM licensee. But if you look at your custom silicon business, especially on the x86 architecture, you could make the argument that you\\'re a little bit of a competitor as well.\\\\nSo I\\'m kind of curious to know how you see kind of the reaction to that from a customer perspective? And does that change your view of how you might be able to monetize your own IP in the future?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn, thanks for the question. Look, I think it\\'s a very interesting deal -- the ARM SoftBank deal. I think we have a lot of respect for ARM; they are a close partner. I\\'m not sure we would call them a competitor. Overall, they are a partner.\\\\nAs it relates to how we think about our IP, we really believe that our IP, particularly the high performance element of it on the microprocessor and the graphic side, is very unique, and in some sense, there are very few places in the industry where you have access to it. I think the applications that need it, whether you are talking about consumer applications or enterprise cloud applications, are growing. And so it\\'s an opportunity for us to look for larger markets to monetize beyond just our own products.\\\\nAnd that\\'s, in general, the way we think about IP monetization. We have a set of products that is very important to our business model, but our IP can go further than our products themselves. And so we would continue to look for opportunities to monetize our IP.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd again, I apologize if I missed this -- you commented on sort of your expectations for GPUs going into Q3 and for semicustom. How do you view the PC outlook within your total outlook above ATM? And I\\'ve got a quick follow-on.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. So let me talk about the PC market overall. I think our view of the PC market is pretty similar to others in the industry. We would say, overall for 2016, high-single digit decline. We have seen some positive signals, and we saw some positive data points from IDC earlier the last week. And then we saw a little bit of pickup in consumption in June from our OEM customers. But again, that was compared to -- let\\'s call it a soft April/May.\\\\nOur view is OEM business looks okay. The channel for us is still weaker than we would like, and that\\'s our view of the PC business. Even in that framework, we believe we can grow our Computing and Graphics business on the strength of the products. The Graphics products, we\\'ve talked about, as they ramp in the second half of the year. And on the Computing side as well, I think we have a number of new platforms, and back-to-school and holiday are important for us. So that\\'s the way would characterize PCs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo, Lisa, not to put words in your mouth, but for Q3, PC\\'s up but perhaps not up as much as seasonal? Is that the best way to think about it within your guide?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI would say roughly seasonal -- roughly seasonal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s helpful. And then lastly, guys, I apologize, but Devinder, now that you\\'ve got revenue growth behind you and you\\'ve got some momentum here, how do we think about the gross margin progression from here and kind of the puts and takes? And I know there\\'s lot of different dynamics there, including the mix of semicustom. But from these levels, how should we think about gross margin progression over the next, call it, two to four quarters?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, John, I think the way you think about it is, it is the mix of business, so that\\'s a good observation. But also you see us making continuing investments in our roadmap in graphics and in other areas, and we believe that will help us improve the gross margin. And then as you look out longer-term, as you observe -- get beyond a couple of quarters and get into 2017, we do have the Zen product introduction coming up. We also have a product in the pro graphics area, and that should drive even higher gross margins compared to where we are today, given the mix will get better with those products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks. Well, thanks, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, John.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore, Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. This is Sidney Ho asking -- calling in for Ross. Just follow up to -- with the last question by focusing on third quarter, you guided third-quarter gross margin to be flat, but the profile seem -- of revenue growth seems to be -- would suggest gross margin should decline on a mix adjusted basis.\\\\nHow should we think about gross margin by segment in Q3? What are some of the moving parts? And maybe follow-up to that, do you expect the gross margin of the new custom design wins ramping this quarter to have better or worse margins than your game console business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think that\\'s well-put. I mean if you look overall when we have a higher mix of semicustom business, typically the gross margin is lower since the business model on the semicustom side has for the lower margin just the way the model is constructed. So keeping it flat at 31% with the guide in Q3 was variable in Q2. We were pretty pleased with that. And I think you\\'re seeing some of the strength underlying the non-semicustom business is allowing us to keep it flat quarter-on-quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. And then my follow-up question is -- you guys talked about the Zen products at Computex and it\\'s on track for launching in the first half of 2017. Can you talk about the impact on R&D expense and maybe on gross margin on the preparation of this launch over the next few quarters? And if you hit your revenue plan that you have thought about, at what point do you need to start increasing OpEx from the $330 million to $350 million level?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThe OpEx side of it, if I look at it from that standpoint, you have seen our OpEx actually go up; in Q3, we are guiding at the $350 million level with specific targeted investments we are making in key R&D areas and products, in particular the high performance roadmap that we have laid out. But we are also making some specific investments in the marketing area, given the new products that are coming out on the PC side as well as the GPU side, trying to attract end-users back to the AMD brand.\\\\nAnd I think you\\'ll continue to see us do that. And that helps obviously with this new product underlying the better margins that you get with the fresh cycle, in particular with the new technology areas that we are putting our products in.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Maybe just one quick follow-up. For Q4 with an extra week in the fiscal quarter, should we expect OpEx to be at the high end of levels, that that will be enough -- that $350 million?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI\\'m not prepared -- you know, one of the things about OpEx as I always say even if you look at Q3, the OpEx is up on a guided basis at $350 million, but very much as I always say, we manage the OpEx pretty tightly. We\\'ve done that over the last several years, and obviously it gets modulated somewhat by revenue. Q3, our revenue is up 18%, OpEx is at $350 million and we\\'ll talk about Q4 when we gather here in about 90 days.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI was also curious about GlobalFoundries being so low in Q2. And I guess have you guys finalized the 2016 wafer supply agreement? And can you talk more generally about which products -- how you are deciding which products are allocated to Global and TSMC? And is there anything that\\'s exclusive to one or the other?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, several parts to it. I mean the working relationship, as Lisa said, with GlobalFoundries is very good. We continue to work through the 2016 WSA and that\\'s not finalized; we\\'re in the process of negotiating that. In the meantime, we continue to get delivery of wafers for the products that we need in line with the product demand and mix of business. And relative to your -- which products from which foundry, we typically do not share the source of foundry for any of our wafers or products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. That\\'s fair. And then with regards to kind of thinking about next year\\'s OpEx, when you look at the importance of a CPU that can attack the server market and can attack the high end of the sort of enthusiast CPU market, I guess I don\\'t want you to necessarily be constrained by the R&D requirements of the last couple of years.\\\\nI mean, so how do you think about that? If you start to show some revenue traction, I mean, can you -- how much flexibility do you think there is on spending? I\\'m not asking for a number, but just qualitatively, how are you thinking about profitability versus investing in these opportunities next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe, I would say my engineers would be very happy to hear you say that. So look, I appreciate the question. I think you\\'ve seen -- and Devinder said this -- we\\'re going to be disciplined in OpEx. And as this quarter was an important turning point for us, to return to operating profitability, I think we have a nice sort of a view into Q3.\\\\nWe will look for opportunities to ensure that we are strategically placing the big bets in R&D, and both on the CPU and the GPU side. For example, this year, we have ramped up our investments on the graphics side with the formation of the Radeon Technologies Group, and what we\\'re doing in both hardware and software -- very significant investments.\\\\nAnd similarly on the CPU side as well. So, I think we take very seriously our commitments in terms of profitability, but we will invest in the future and we\\'ll continue to look for opportunities to balance those in the right way.\\\\nI don\\'t know, Devinder, if you want to add --?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nNo, I think that\\'s well-said. In 2017, obviously, as we get to the back half of the year, Q3 we have guided, we\\'re getting to that -- get through Q3 and get into Q4. And at that point, we\\'ll start thinking about where we want to place our bets as these are put in terms of the longer-term investments in 2017. Right now we\\'re really focused on getting -- we got to non-GAAP operating profitability this quarter. We want to maintain that in Q3 and then we\\'ll see what happens from there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Danely, Citigroup.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis is Marco Chan calling on behalf of Chris Danely. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is, could you please update us on your expectations on the THATIC x86 server JV in China? Are there any potential legal risks with it, potentially Intel?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So relative to the server JV that we have with THATIC, as we stated before, we believe that our joint venture is operational. I think it\\'s well underway. The technology that we\\'re licensing is AMD technology, and so we don\\'t have any issues relative to licensing. I think --\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. If I may add, I mean, one thing on the update, I guess, if you look at the prepared remarks and the commentary for Q3 is, we now expect, based on technology transfer milestone completion, to recognize $22 million to authorize a gain in Q3 and approximately $75 million for the year, which is higher than what we had said previously when we said it was $52 million for the year. So you can see it\\'s incremental and therefore, as Lisa said, things are operationally on track and we continue to meet our technology transfer milestones from a date standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up -- I know you guys mentioned PCs and Graphics segment should be up year-over-year. Could you guys get into more detail, maybe talk about each segment individually, your trends for PCs versus GPUs?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we don\\'t usually go into granularity about the subsegments of the business. I think it\\'s fair to say that our PC business has stabilized. And what we\\'re seeing now is the opportunity, as we go into the seasonally stronger half of the year on both the PC side and graphics side, on top of that with some new product launches, we believe that we will end up growing year-over-year. But again, we don\\'t usually guide to the details within the segment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava, BMO.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on your Project Scorpio comment. I think it\\'s going to be launched in 2017. And I think you had significantly higher performance and support 4K and V. So how should we think about the pricing on ASP that compares to what you have indicated on the current generation game console platform?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So, again we don\\'t -- we wouldn\\'t disclose anything that\\'s incrementally more than what our customer has disclosed. So I think Microsoft has talked about their goals with Project Scorpio. I think we are in support of those goals. Given the performance level, you would imagine that there\\'s more capability on chip, but I wouldn\\'t want to go more than that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. As a follow-up -- I think your competitor has launched a comparable mainstream product -- I think GeForce 10 6P, so given the absence of your maybe higher performance part launching maybe in the second half, so how should we think about the rest of the year on the demand on your graphics side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we are feeling very good about our Polaris launch. This was our strategy from the beginning. I mean we laid out a strategy where we were going after the mainstream, and growth rate, really a new experience in terms of both capability and price point. And I think we\\'ve done that.\\\\nWe\\'ve also been very focused on DX 12 and our performance -- on new APIs like Vulcan. So we are happy with our competitiveness. I think it\\'s played out as we thought it would do. Certainly our aspirations in GPU are to certainly have very competitive products across the entire product line. And so I\\'ve talked about working on Vega, which is the next generation high-end architecture.\\\\nBut in terms of our competitiveness, you know, we -- again, we\\'ve executed what we thought we were going to execute. And it seems like, from both customer reviews and analyst reviews, that it\\'s pretty well-received by the market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator, we\\'ll take two more callers, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [73]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing, MKM Partners.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [74]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thank you for fitting me in. So EESC -- looks like you achieved operating income same level as third quarter of last year but with $45 million lower revenue. So just wondering how you got more profitable in this segment, given these are both strong game console quarters and also you\\'ve got annual price declines in game consoles, I assume. Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think if you look at the profitability, you\\'ve got to remember that in the EESC segment, we also have other businesses embedded for one, and also the investment we are making for the enterprise side of it, for the data center product that\\'s coming out in 2017. So the profitability -- you\\'re right about the observation, but profitability depends upon obviously -- the largest business we have in there right now is the semicustom business, but also the investments on the OpEx standpoint that we make year-on-year. And we talked about the targeted investments we are making in some of the product areas.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. But these are relatively older products that are embedded into enterprise products at the moment then, it sounds like. Okay, great. And then my follow-on is -- you are at a one-year cadence for GPUs now. Could you talk about expectations on how last year\\'s R9300 series winds down and how that plays out? It looks like in Q2, it was really just a lack of a pause ahead of a known refresh. And do you expect sort of a sharp wind-down at some point? Or is it more gradual?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [77]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nActually, Ian, that\\'s a good observation. The 390 series or the 300 series overall actually did do okay in the second quarter. We were also wondering whether there would be a pause prior to a new generation. I think we see it as a very orderly transition; it\\'s actually one of our better product transitions as we go from the 300 series over to the 400 series.\\\\nSo again, nothing very spectacular to report other than the sellthrough has continued -- the sellthrough was good in the second quarter. And we believe that it\\'s an orderly transition of the inventory.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [78]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay, great. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [79]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Ian.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [80]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Jaguar Bajwa from Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [81]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. Just a question on Q3. Could you just lay out which would be the fastest-growing sequential segment in Q3? Will that be the GPU business, CPU or semicustom? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [82]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar, I think what we would say is that our Q3 guidance is both semicustom and graphics will be the drivers of the sequential revenue growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [83]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thanks. And then could you just give a bit more clarity around Vega timing? And also what do you expect to be your differentiation here versus what Nvidia has done with Pascal?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [84]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAgain, I think we\\'ll talk more about the details of the Vega architecture in time, but certainly Vega is a high-performance GPU that will use high-bandwidth memory as part of it. So, I would leave the details for a more -- as we go -- get closer to the Vega launch date.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [85]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Well, maybe just one final one then. When we get into the server CPU cycle with Zen, should we expect any kind of contribution from an APU format with CPU plus Vega? Because we\\'re seeing a lot of acceleration now in the data center. Do you think that could be a key product for you guys which maybe your competitors may not have, bringing an APU to the server market for high-performance servers?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [86]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think it\\'s fair to say that we do believe we can combine high-performance CPU with the high-performance GPU. As we look at our GPU compute in general, sort of our both professionals graphics and server markets for GPU, I think that will increasingly become an area of focus for us as we continue to grow the graphics business.\\\\nSo I think the answer is yes. I mean, obviously, it will come in time, but it\\'s an area where combining the two technologies makes a lot of sense.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [87]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [88]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [89]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator, that concludes the question-and-answer session. If you wouldn\\'t mind wrapping up the call, please?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [90]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCertainly. That concludes today\\'s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\\\\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ruth Cotter, Chief Human Resources Officer, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you and welcome to AMD\\'s second-quarter conference call. By now you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary and slides. If you\\'ve not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD\\'s website at IOR.AMD.com.\\\\nParticipants on today\\'s conference call are Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on AMD.com.\\\\nI\\'d like to take the opportunity to highlight a few dates for you.

And our third-quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, September 16, 2016. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that second quarter -- that the second-quarter 2016 was a 13-week quarter, and we expect to record our extra week in the fourth quarter of 2016.\\\\nToday\\'s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.\\\\nAdditionally, please note we will be referring to non-GAAP figures during this call except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary that we\\'ve posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.AMD.com.\\\\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements in today\\'s earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD\\'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 2016.\\\\nNow with that, I\\'d like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Ruth. And good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our ongoing focus on diversifying our business model and delivering great products is creating solid market and financial momentum. Looking at the second-quarter specifically, strong semicustom demand and better-than-seasonal graphic sales drove a 23% sequential revenue increase and our return to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWe also recorded our first full quarter licensing gain from our China server JV, THATIC, and improved our balance sheet with cash proceeds from the formation of our ATMP joint venture, with NFME. Looking at our Computing and Graphic segment, revenue decreased 5% sequentially, as stronger-than-seasonal GPU sales were offset by a decline in desktop processor sales.\\\\nFirst-half 2016 GPU sales increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, as the investments we have been making to develop leadership graphics hardware, software and drivers, combined with new marketing campaigns, are paying off.\\\\nOur strong second-quarter graphics performance was capped by the launch of our new Polaris based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June, which helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014. The Radeon RX family resets expectations around the experiences and features gamers now want in a mainstream GPU.\\\\nWe are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desk top GPUs, and Polaris based notebooks from our OEM customers. We also delivered our third straight quarter of sequential professionals graphics revenue growth and believe we gained share driven by increased adoption of FirePro graphics by OEMs as well as several cloud data center GPU compute wins.\\\\nIn client, mobile APUs sales increased for the third straight quarter, partially offsetting decreased desktop processor sales led by channel softness in China. Shipments of our recently launched seventh generation APUs are ramping well and outpacing sales of our six-generation APUs at this point in their lifecycle.\\\\nMore than 25 new seventh generation APU systems, including several premium designs, are expected to be widely available in the coming months from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, providing us with confidence in this part of our business as we enter the seasonally stronger second half of the year.\\\\nTurning to our enterprise embedded and semicustom segment, our 59% sequential revenue increase is the largest since our first full quarter of semicustom products shipments in 2013. As in the previous two years, we expect semicustom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semicustom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.\\\\nLast quarter at E3, Microsoft announced two new members of the Xbox One family powered by AMD. The Xbox One S is the slimmest Xbox console ever, and the first to support HDR. The system is expected to go on sale in the coming weeks. Microsoft also announced their next-generation game console, code-named Project Scorpio, for the 2017 holidays.\\\\nProject Scorpios is designed to be fully compatible with existing Xbox One software, while leveraging AMD\\'s leadership gaming technologies to create more immersive 4K and VR gaming experiences. Project Scorpio is one of the semicustom design wins we communicated previously.\\\\nOur next generation Zen processor products passed several key milestones in the quarter as well. I\\'m excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers\\' labs.\\\\nWe are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.\\\\nIn closing, over the last 18 months, we have been diligently executing our strategic plan to improve our financial performance by delivering great products, strengthening our customer relationships, and simplifying our business. In the past six months alone, we released our game-changing Polaris architecture, completed our ATMP JV transaction, announced a JV and IP licensing transaction with THATIC, and returned to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWhile we recognize we have more work to do, we believe that, based on the ongoing ramps of our semicustom SoCs, Polaris GPUs, and seventh generation APUs, we can deliver full-year revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on delivering our road map of high performance products and technologies, including Zen and our next generation Vega GPU architecture that can drive long-term growth.\\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second-quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was a strong quarter, punctuated by better-than-expected financial performance, driven by demand for our semicustom SoCs and the closure of our ATMP joint venture transaction with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, which bolstered our cash position.\\\\nSecond-quarter revenue was $1.027 billion, up 23% sequentially, driven by higher sales of semicustom SoCs. The year-over-year revenue increase was 9% with higher sales in both reportable segments. Gross margin was 31%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of semicustom SoCs sales.\\\\nOperating expenses were $342 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased marketing investments. We also recognized a $26 million licensing gain associated with our JV with THATIC, and restructuring credits of $7 million, primarily related to facilities. We are pleased to report operating income of $3 million this quarter.\\\\nNet loss was $40 million with loss per share of $0.05, calculated using 794 million basic shares in the quarter. We recorded a pretax gain of $150 million related to the ATMP JV transaction, an equity loss of $3 million based on our 15% ownership stake, and taxes of $27 million related to the JV transaction. Adjusted EBITDA was a positive $36 million compared to negative $22 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments -- Computing and Graphics revenue was $435 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of client desktop processors and chipsets. Revenue was up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by higher client notebook Processor and Graphics sales.\\\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating loss was $81 million compared to $70 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower revenue. Enterprise, embedded and semicustom revenue was $592 million, up 59% from the prior quarter and 5% higher than the prior year, driven by higher semicustom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from [$16 million] in the prior quarter, driven by higher revenue and a $26 million IP licensing gain compared to a licensing gain of $7 million in the first quarter.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter. Inventory was $743 million, up $68 million or 10% from the prior quarter, and higher than guided, in support of expected higher semicustom sales in the third quarter.\\\\nIn the second quarter, we recorded a $62 million investment on our balance sheet related to our 15% ownership stake in the ATMP JV. Total wafer purchases from GlobalFoundries in the second quarter were 75 million and year-to-date, we have purchased 259 million.\\\\nDebt as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, and includes total borrowings of $226 million on our secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow in the second quarter was negative $106 million compared to a negative $68 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the inventory build in support of strong second-half revenue.\\\\nNow turning to the outlook, which is based on a 13-week fiscal quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by our graphics and semicustom products, including the ramp of new semicustom business; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million, due to an increase in R&D investments; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $22 million to maintain non-GAAP operating profitability; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes or other -- and other to be approximately $45 million; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately flat; and inventory to be approximately $700 million. And lastly, for the full-year 2016, we expect low-single digit revenue growth year-over-year.\\\\nIn closing, we are pleased with the progress we\\'ve made this quarter. We launched exciting new products in the second quarter, with more expected to come to help drive strong revenue growth and improved financial performance in the third quarter. We recognize there\\'s a lot more work to be done to return AMD to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation, and look forward to continuing our progress over the coming quarters.\\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Devinder. Operator, if you could poll the audience please for a question-and-answer session?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) David Wong, Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMy first question -- can you give us any detail on the ramp in dollar terms of revenues from new semicustom products in the September/December quarters, and what the seasonal pattern of these products might be?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, David. This is Lisa. Let me start with that. So, our semicustom business overall, we see as strong for the year. I think the predominant business is the current generation game consoles, and as they ramp into the second half and the stronger holiday season.\\\\nWe expect the seasonality of semicustoms to be similar to prior years. We\\'ll see a peak in the third quarter and a decline in the fourth quarter, and we will see the new business layer in starting in the third quarter. But I don\\'t expect that to change the seasonality pattern. So, we are building up for a strong holiday season overall.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Lisa. And since the launch of your Radeon 480 graphics product end of last month, have you been able to supply to demand for the cards? Or if not, when do you expect demand will rise to match supply?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So, David, we\\'re very pleased with the launch of the Radeon RX 480. We had good supply at major retailers on launch day. Since then, the demand has continued to be strong and so some of the retailers are out of supply. We do see that the 14 LPP yields are good and we\\'re ramping up production steeply.\\\\nSo we expect that will equalize as we go through the quarter. We\\'re also very soon going to launch the rest of the Radeon RX family. And so you\\'ll see three products in the third quarter in terms of overall product momentum.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Thanks very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, David.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis, Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. First one -- Lisa, maybe for you -- the China licensing deal was -- I thought it was creative and fascinating. Can you characterize kind of the pipeline of IP deals that you have or the technology deals? Is this it? Or do you have more in the pipe? Can you talk about timing or the types of deals you might be working on?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Mark. So the China JV, as you said, we announced it last quarter and it\\'s now in operation. It\\'s actually going well, so we\\'re on track for some of the important milestone deliveries that we had.\\\\nIn terms of the overall pipeline, I would say we have a nice set of interesting opportunities. They\\'re -- very much, as you know, they take a while for them to come to fruition, but we feel good about the model which is partnering with folks that need high-performance technology. And we\\'ll continue to work those deals as we go through the next couple of quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. And I\\'ll follow-up if I may. I was hoping that you could just help me with the accounting of the semicustom design wins. So if I remember properly, there was two that you expect in the back half of this year, and then one -- I thought it was the first half of next year.\\\\nSo Scorpio is one of those three? But that\\'s next year; so that\\'s the one for next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, let me help you out with the accounting -- I know that we\\'ve had several different pieces of information on the semicustom new design wins. So what we said is we\\'ll have a total of three semicustom new design wins that will account for about -- let\\'s call it $1.5 billion of revenue approximately over the next three to four years.\\\\nWe are starting the ramp of new business this coming quarter, this third quarter, and that will be one of the semicustom design wins. Scorpio is also a design win, and that, as our customer said, will be in 2017. And we\\'ll give you more information about the third one as we have more visibility.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd do you have more design wins that you just haven\\'t announced or mentioned timing of?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, we\\'re trying to get out a little bit of the counting game, but I think overall, we\\'re pleased with the semicustom pipeline. I think some of the questions that we\\'ve been asked are, do we believe we have design wins outside of game consoles, and the answer is yes. We have design wins outside of game consoles. I think we view the pipeline as good, and it\\'s a business model that works well with our high-performance technology plans and our SoC capabilities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. That\\'s very helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Mark.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my questions. Lisa, I have a couple of questions on Zen. You gave some color in your prepared remarks about server opportunities for Zen starting in the first half of next year. Maybe you could give us a little color on potentially what markets you are going after there, where you see the opportunities?\\\\nIt seems to me that a lot of different moving parts in the cloud market with open power and ARM, and then custom CPUs from Intel, but a pretty big enterprise space that\\'s x86 captive for you guys to go after. So I would just be interested to see what the strategy is going forward there and where the design wins might come from?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Matt. So, yes, let me give you a little bit of color how we see it. First of all, look, Zen is a brand-new CPU design and we had very ambitious goals for it. And given where we are today, it\\'s actually coming up very well.\\\\nWe\\'ve demoed both desktop systems, and now we have server systems working in both our labs and our customers\\' labs. I would say as the progress of Zen is -- goes along in terms of validation, the customer interest has increased. And so, while we did close a number of design wins in the second quarter and we have a number more in the pipeline, as we go into the third quarter and more widespread availability.\\\\nOur view is, Zen is a general-purpose server architecture that can play in many different places. So you mentioned the cloud. I think that\\'s certainly one target market given the growth there. We also see there are workloads that would be particularly -- fit well for sort of the performance areas that we\\'re targeting. I think enterprise is also again very much a target area for Zen.\\\\nWhat we are looking for again is ensuring that we have a very high quality launch, and so we\\'re working very closely with customers to make sure that we run their workloads and demonstrate the performance improvement that we expect. But as I said overall, it\\'s going well, and we continue to work with customers to ensure that they see the benefits of Zen and working with AMD.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you for the color and it\\'s good to hear. I guess another question on Zen more in the PC market -- because I think your prepared remarks focused a bit more on server -- but maybe you could give us a little bit of an update in the timing of desktop and notebook potential launches.\\\\nIt just seems to me going into the holiday season that it\\'s still a little unclear as to where Zen is going to land relative to holiday ramps in the Western market and to Chinese New Year. So any color around that would be really helpful. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. No, that\\'s a fair question, Matt. So we have been very focused on the server launch for first half of 2017. Desktop should launch before that. In terms of true volume availability, I believe it will be in the first quarter of 2017. We may ship some limited volume towards the end of the fourth quarter, based on how bring-up goes and the customer readiness.\\\\nBut again, if I look overall at what we are trying to do, I think the desktop product is very well-positioned for that high-end desktop segment, that enthusiast segment, in both channel and OEM, which is very much a segment that AMD knows well. And so that\\'s where we would focus -- on desktop.\\\\nYou should expect a notebook version of Zen with integrated graphics in 2017, and that development is going on as well. And so I think it\\'s just a time of a lot of activity around the Zen and the different Zen product families.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much. Congratulations on the return to profitability.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Matt.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my questions. I was looking at the implied guidance for Q4. You said the -- I guess for the full year, up low single digits. So, I mean, call it 3%. But it would imply Q4 down 16%/17% sequentially, and actually down on an absolute basis, lower than I would\\'ve thought. I think Q4 also has an extra week in it.\\\\nI was wondering if you could give us, I guess, some color on how you see the drivers, I guess, for seasonality going from Q3 to Q4 across both of the businesses, given that, I guess, the trajectory of the different product launches that we have in the back half? Like, how do you come to that number?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. Stacy, maybe I\\'ll start and see if Devinder would like to add to it. So, look, our -- when we started the year, our expectation is that we would grow revenue in 2016 versus 2015, but we were coming off of a very low base in the first quarter. So we\\'ve been pleased with how it played out certainly in our second-quarter revenue and the third quarter revenue guidance.\\\\nOverall, the businesses are performing well, so we do expect both Computing and Graphics and EEFC to both grow for the year. I think the semicustom business is the large driver of the fourth quarter in terms of just how we see the overall business playing out. But the Computing and Graphics business is playing out as you might expect.\\\\nSo the second half should be seasonally higher, certainly with Polaris, and as we launch broader availability across the product line, as well as the seventh generation APUs as they go into back-to-school and holiday. So that\\'s the way we should think about it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at your notebook shipments in the quarter. So they were up again sequentially -- I think they were up double digits in Q1; I think they were up in Q4 as well. So three quarters in a row of sequential increase. Obviously off a low base as well.\\\\nBut how confident are you -- like what\\'s driving that? Is this -- is it actually sort of a sell-out that\\'s actually driving the demand? Or is this sell-in into the channel? And how should we think about that potentially normalizing?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, so if you\\'re talking about the notebook computing business, actually we are kind of pleased with how it performed. So if you look at it, overall, the -- our OEM customers have adopted our technologies, so we see that across both notebook and desktop, but presumably notebook.\\\\nWe are also making progress in commercial, and that was a very important initiative over the past five or six quarters. And so that\\'s been nice to stabilize the business. And again, I don\\'t believe it\\'s a sell-in phenomenon. Actually it\\'s consumption share that we see increasing. And I think we have a reasonable opportunity to add to that in the second half of the year. But it\\'s really around our products in the platforms that we\\'re putting together with the OEMs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. If I could ask one more really quick. I was just a little bit surprised at how much your wafer purchases at GlobalFoundries came down quarter-over-quarter, given the increase in notebooks as well as the timing of the Polaris launch. Any -- what -- should we read anything into that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think basically the purchases of the wafers are in line with product demand and mix of business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the other day we purchased about [$260 million] of wafers, and we are getting into the back half of the year, which as you can see, with our revenue guidance in Q3, is pretty strong.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer, Credit Suisse Group.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on orchestrating the turnaround. I guess, Lisa, my first question, I would kind of like to get your view on the news earlier this week around Softbank and ARM. You are sort of in a unique position because you are both kind of a partner with ARM as an ARM licensee. But if you look at your custom silicon business, especially on the x86 architecture, you could make the argument that you\\'re a little bit of a competitor as well.\\\\nSo I\\'m kind of curious to know how you see kind of the reaction to that from a customer perspective? And does that change your view of how you might be able to monetize your own IP in the future?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn, thanks for the question. Look, I think it\\'s a very interesting deal -- the ARM SoftBank deal. I think we have a lot of respect for ARM; they are a close partner. I\\'m not sure we would call them a competitor. Overall, they are a partner.\\\\nAs it relates to how we think about our IP, we really believe that our IP, particularly the high performance element of it on the microprocessor and the graphic side, is very unique, and in some sense, there are very few places in the industry where you have access to it. I think the applications that need it, whether you are talking about consumer applications or enterprise cloud applications, are growing. And so it\\'s an opportunity for us to look for larger markets to monetize beyond just our own products.\\\\nAnd that\\'s, in general, the way we think about IP monetization. We have a set of products that is very important to our business model, but our IP can go further than our products themselves. And so we would continue to look for opportunities to monetize our IP.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd again, I apologize if I missed this -- you commented on sort of your expectations for GPUs going into Q3 and for semicustom. How do you view the PC outlook within your total outlook above ATM? And I\\'ve got a quick follow-on.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. So let me talk about the PC market overall. I think our view of the PC market is pretty similar to others in the industry. We would say, overall for 2016, high-single digit decline. We have seen some positive signals, and we saw some positive data points from IDC earlier the last week. And then we saw a little bit of pickup in consumption in June from our OEM customers. But again, that was compared to -- let\\'s call it a soft April/May.\\\\nOur view is OEM business looks okay. The channel for us is still weaker than we would like, and that\\'s our view of the PC business. Even in that framework, we believe we can grow our Computing and Graphics business on the strength of the products. The Graphics products, we\\'ve talked about, as they ramp in the second half of the year. And on the Computing side as well, I think we have a number of new platforms, and back-to-school and holiday are important for us. So that\\'s the way would characterize PCs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo, Lisa, not to put words in your mouth, but for Q3, PC\\'s up but perhaps not up as much as seasonal? Is that the best way to think about it within your guide?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI would say roughly seasonal -- roughly seasonal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s helpful. And then lastly, guys, I apologize, but Devinder, now that you\\'ve got revenue growth behind you and you\\'ve got some momentum here, how do we think about the gross margin progression from here and kind of the puts and takes? And I know there\\'s lot of different dynamics there, including the mix of semicustom. But from these levels, how should we think about gross margin progression over the next, call it, two to four quarters?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, John, I think the way you think about it is, it is the mix of business, so that\\'s a good observation. But also you see us making continuing investments in our roadmap in graphics and in other areas, and we believe that will help us improve the gross margin. And then as you look out longer-term, as you observe -- get beyond a couple of quarters and get into 2017, we do have the Zen product introduction coming up. We also have a product in the pro graphics area, and that should drive even higher gross margins compared to where we are today, given the mix will get better with those products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks. Well, thanks, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, John.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore, Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. This is Sidney Ho asking -- calling in for Ross. Just follow up to -- with the last question by focusing on third quarter, you guided third-quarter gross margin to be flat, but the profile seem -- of revenue growth seems to be -- would suggest gross margin should decline on a mix adjusted basis.\\\\nHow should we think about gross margin by segment in Q3? What are some of the moving parts? And maybe follow-up to that, do you expect the gross margin of the new custom design wins ramping this quarter to have better or worse margins than your game console business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think that\\'s well-put. I mean if you look overall when we have a higher mix of semicustom business, typically the gross margin is lower since the business model on the semicustom side has for the lower margin just the way the model is constructed. So keeping it flat at 31% with the guide in Q3 was variable in Q2. We were pretty pleased with that. And I think you\\'re seeing some of the strength underlying the non-semicustom business is allowing us to keep it flat quarter-on-quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. And then my follow-up question is -- you guys talked about the Zen products at Computex and it\\'s on track for launching in the first half of 2017. Can you talk about the impact on R&D expense and maybe on gross margin on the preparation of this launch over the next few quarters? And if you hit your revenue plan that you have thought about, at what point do you need to start increasing OpEx from the $330 million to $350 million level?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThe OpEx side of it, if I look at it from that standpoint, you have seen our OpEx actually go up; in Q3, we are guiding at the $350 million level with specific targeted investments we are making in key R&D areas and products, in particular the high performance roadmap that we have laid out. But we are also making some specific investments in the marketing area, given the new products that are coming out on the PC side as well as the GPU side, trying to attract end-users back to the AMD brand.\\\\nAnd I think you\\'ll continue to see us do that. And that helps obviously with this new product underlying the better margins that you get with the fresh cycle, in particular with the new technology areas that we are putting our products in.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Maybe just one quick follow-up. For Q4 with an extra week in the fiscal quarter, should we expect OpEx to be at the high end of levels, that that will be enough -- that $350 million?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI\\'m not prepared -- you know, one of the things about OpEx as I always say even if you look at Q3, the OpEx is up on a guided basis at $350 million, but very much as I always say, we manage the OpEx pretty tightly. We\\'ve done that over the last several years, and obviously it gets modulated somewhat by revenue. Q3, our revenue is up 18%, OpEx is at $350 million and we\\'ll talk about Q4 when we gather here in about 90 days.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI was also curious about GlobalFoundries being so low in Q2. And I guess have you guys finalized the 2016 wafer supply agreement? And can you talk more generally about which products -- how you are deciding which products are allocated to Global and TSMC? And is there anything that\\'s exclusive to one or the other?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, several parts to it. I mean the working relationship, as Lisa said, with GlobalFoundries is very good. We continue to work through the 2016 WSA and that\\'s not finalized; we\\'re in the process of negotiating that. In the meantime, we continue to get delivery of wafers for the products that we need in line with the product demand and mix of business. And relative to your -- which products from which foundry, we typically do not share the source of foundry for any of our wafers or products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. That\\'s fair. And then with regards to kind of thinking about next year\\'s OpEx, when you look at the importance of a CPU that can attack the server market and can attack the high end of the sort of enthusiast CPU market, I guess I don\\'t want you to necessarily be constrained by the R&D requirements of the last couple of years.\\\\nI mean, so how do you think about that? If you start to show some revenue traction, I mean, can you -- how much flexibility do you think there is on spending? I\\'m not asking for a number, but just qualitatively, how are you thinking about profitability versus investing in these opportunities next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe, I would say my engineers would be very happy to hear you say that. So look, I appreciate the question. I think you\\'ve seen -- and Devinder said this -- we\\'re going to be disciplined in OpEx. And as this quarter was an important turning point for us, to return to operating profitability, I think we have a nice sort of a view into Q3.\\\\nWe will look for opportunities to ensure that we are strategically placing the big bets in R&D, and both on the CPU and the GPU side. For example, this year, we have ramped up our investments on the graphics side with the formation of the Radeon Technologies Group, and what we\\'re doing in both hardware and software -- very significant investments.\\\\nAnd similarly on the CPU side as well. So, I think we take very seriously our commitments in terms of profitability, but we will invest in the future and we\\'ll continue to look for opportunities to balance those in the right way.\\\\nI don\\'t know, Devinder, if you want to add --?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nNo, I think that\\'s well-said. In 2017, obviously, as we get to the back half of the year, Q3 we have guided, we\\'re getting to that -- get through Q3 and get into Q4. And at that point, we\\'ll start thinking about where we want to place our bets as these are put in terms of the longer-term investments in 2017. Right now we\\'re really focused on getting -- we got to non-GAAP operating profitability this quarter. We want to maintain that in Q3 and then we\\'ll see what happens from there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Danely, Citigroup.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis is Marco Chan calling on behalf of Chris Danely. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is, could you please update us on your expectations on the THATIC x86 server JV in China? Are there any potential legal risks with it, potentially Intel?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So relative to the server JV that we have with THATIC, as we stated before, we believe that our joint venture is operational. I think it\\'s well underway. The technology that we\\'re licensing is AMD technology, and so we don\\'t have any issues relative to licensing. I think --\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. If I may add, I mean, one thing on the update, I guess, if you look at the prepared remarks and the commentary for Q3 is, we now expect, based on technology transfer milestone completion, to recognize $22 million to authorize a gain in Q3 and approximately $75 million for the year, which is higher than what we had said previously when we said it was $52 million for the year. So you can see it\\'s incremental and therefore, as Lisa said, things are operationally on track and we continue to meet our technology transfer milestones from a date standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up -- I know you guys mentioned PCs and Graphics segment should be up year-over-year. Could you guys get into more detail, maybe talk about each segment individually, your trends for PCs versus GPUs?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we don\\'t usually go into granularity about the subsegments of the business. I think it\\'s fair to say that our PC business has stabilized. And what we\\'re seeing now is the opportunity, as we go into the seasonally stronger half of the year on both the PC side and graphics side, on top of that with some new product launches, we believe that we will end up growing year-over-year. But again, we don\\'t usually guide to the details within the segment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava, BMO.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on your Project Scorpio comment. I think it\\'s going to be launched in 2017. And I think you had significantly higher performance and support 4K and V. So how should we think about the pricing on ASP that compares to what you have indicated on the current generation game console platform?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So, again we don\\'t -- we wouldn\\'t disclose anything that\\'s incrementally more than what our customer has disclosed. So I think Microsoft has talked about their goals with Project Scorpio. I think we are in support of those goals. Given the performance level, you would imagine that there\\'s more capability on chip, but I wouldn\\'t want to go more than that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. As a follow-up -- I think your competitor has launched a comparable mainstream product -- I think GeForce 10 6P, so given the absence of your maybe higher performance part launching maybe in the second half, so how should we think about the rest of the year on the demand on your graphics side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we are feeling very good about our Polaris launch. This was our strategy from the beginning. I mean we laid out a strategy where we were going after the mainstream, and growth rate, really a new experience in terms of both capability and price point. And I think we\\'ve done that.\\\\nWe\\'ve also been very focused on DX 12 and our performance -- on new APIs like Vulcan. So we are happy with our competitiveness. I think it\\'s played out as we thought it would do. Certainly our aspirations in GPU are to certainly have very competitive products across the entire product line. And so I\\'ve talked about working on Vega, which is the next generation high-end architecture.\\\\nBut in terms of our competitiveness, you know, we -- again, we\\'ve executed what we thought we were going to execute. And it seems like, from both customer reviews and analyst reviews, that it\\'s pretty well-received by the market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator, we\\'ll take two more callers, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [73]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing, MKM Partners.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [74]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thank you for fitting me in. So EESC -- looks like you achieved operating income same level as third quarter of last year but with $45 million lower revenue. So just wondering how you got more profitable in this segment, given these are both strong game console quarters and also you\\'ve got annual price declines in game consoles, I assume. Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think if you look at the profitability, you\\'ve got to remember that in the EESC segment, we also have other businesses embedded for one, and also the investment we are making for the enterprise side of it, for the data center product that\\'s coming out in 2017. So the profitability -- you\\'re right about the observation, but profitability depends upon obviously -- the largest business we have in there right now is the semicustom business, but also the investments on the OpEx standpoint that we make year-on-year. And we talked about the targeted investments we are making in some of the product areas.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. But these are relatively older products that are embedded into enterprise products at the moment then, it sounds like. Okay, great. And then my follow-on is -- you are at a one-year cadence for GPUs now. Could you talk about expectations on how last year\\'s R9300 series winds down and how that plays out? It looks like in Q2, it was really just a lack of a pause ahead of a known refresh. And do you expect sort of a sharp wind-down at some point? Or is it more gradual?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [77]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nActually, Ian, that\\'s a good observation. The 390 series or the 300 series overall actually did do okay in the second quarter. We were also wondering whether there would be a pause prior to a new generation. I think we see it as a very orderly transition; it\\'s actually one of our better product transitions as we go from the 300 series over to the 400 series.\\\\nSo again, nothing very spectacular to report other than the sellthrough has continued -- the sellthrough was good in the second quarter. And we believe that it\\'s an orderly transition of the inventory.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [78]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay, great. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [79]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Ian.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [80]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Jaguar Bajwa from Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [81]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. Just a question on Q3. Could you just lay out which would be the fastest-growing sequential segment in Q3? Will that be the GPU business, CPU or semicustom? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [82]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar, I think what we would say is that our Q3 guidance is both semicustom and graphics will be the drivers of the sequential revenue growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [83]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thanks. And then could you just give a bit more clarity around Vega timing? And also what do you expect to be your differentiation here versus what Nvidia has done with Pascal?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [84]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAgain, I think we\\'ll talk more about the details of the Vega architecture in time, but certainly Vega is a high-performance GPU that will use high-bandwidth memory as part of it. So, I would leave the details for a more -- as we go -- get closer to the Vega launch date.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [85]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Well, maybe just one final one then. When we get into the server CPU cycle with Zen, should we expect any kind of contribution from an APU format with CPU plus Vega? Because we\\'re seeing a lot of acceleration now in the data center. Do you think that could be a key product for you guys which maybe your competitors may not have, bringing an APU to the server market for high-performance servers?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [86]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think it\\'s fair to say that we do believe we can combine high-performance CPU with the high-performance GPU. As we look at our GPU compute in general, sort of our both professionals graphics and server markets for GPU, I think that will increasingly become an area of focus for us as we continue to grow the graphics business.\\\\nSo I think the answer is yes. I mean, obviously, it will come in time, but it\\'s an area where combining the two technologies makes a lot of sense.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [87]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [88]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [89]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator, that concludes the question-and-answer session. If you wouldn\\'t mind wrapping up the call, please?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [90]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCertainly. That concludes today\\'s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. I am pleased with our strong third quarter execution and results. We delivered our highest quarterly revenue since 2005, our highest quarterly gross margin since 2012 and increased net income significantly, all driven by our first full quarter of 7-nanometer Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processor sales. Third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion increased 9% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, and we expanded gross margin by 3 percentage points year-over-year. \\\\nTurning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue increased 36% year-over-year and sequentially. Demand for Ryzen desktop and notebook processors drove a significant increase in unit shipments and ASP, resulting in our highest client processor quarterly revenue since 2011. We saw particularly strong demand for our top-end Ryzen processors, and believe we gained client processor unit share for the eighth straight quarter. In desktops, we are seeing strong demand for our Ryzen 3000 and previous generation Ryzen 2000 processors. Both product families are consistently among the top sellers at leading e-tailers and retailers globally. In commercial, HP and Lenovo announced new desktop PCs powered by our Ryzen PRO 3000 series processors in the third quarter. We are continuing to expand our presence in the commercial market as more financial, retail, education and health care customers purchase AMD-based PCs and Chromebooks to power their businesses. We are on track to expand our desktop product offerings in November with the launches of the industry\\'s first 16-core mainstream desktop processor as well as our third-generation Ryzen Threadripper processor family. These products will offer unmatched combinations of core counts, performance and energy efficiency for the most demanding high-end desktop and content creation applications. \\\\nIn mobile, we had another quarter of strong double-digit percentage notebook processor revenue growth driven by our virtual product mix and increased unit shipments. The number of AMD-powered laptops from major OEMs has increased by 50% this year, including multiple premium notebooks like the first ever AMD-powered Microsoft Surface laptop. We collaborated closely with Microsoft over several years to develop the AMD-exclusive 15-inch consumer Surface laptop 3, which includes a custom Ryzen Microsoft Surface edition processor and multiple operating system and software optimizations that will benefit all AMD-powered Windows systems. We are very pleased with our momentum in the client business this year and expect client processor revenue to grow sequentially in the fourth quarter as we head into the seasonally strong holiday season. \\\\nIn graphics, revenue increased year-over-year driven largely by higher channel GPU sales. Shipments of our Radeon 5000 GPU family, featuring our RDNA architecture, increased sequentially and we are seeing solid demand for the new products based on their competitive performance and features. For mainstream gamers, we began shipping the Radeon RX 5500 GPU in the third quarter. Acer, HP, Lenovo and MSI announced plans to offer the new GPU in their upcoming PCs and multiple AIB partners plan to launch RX 5500 cards during the fourth quarter. \\\\nData center GPU sales were down sequentially and roughly flat year-over-year. We added multiple cloud and HPC wins in the quarter, highlighted by Microsoft\\'s announcement of a new remote desktop offering for graphics-intensive workloads powered by EPYC CPUs and Radeon Instinct GPUs. We are making good progress growing this margin accretive part of our business as we continue expanding our footprint with marquee customers and targeted data center workloads. \\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue decreased 27% from a year ago, as significantly higher server processor revenue was offset by lower semi-custom sales. We expect semi-custom demand to further soften in the fourth quarter now that both Microsoft and Sony have announced new AMD-powered consoles for holiday 2020. \\\\nIn server, we had our highest quarterly CPU revenue since 2006 as strong second-generation EPYC processor demand drove a greater than 50% sequential increase in unit shipments and revenue. Second-gen EPYC processors are the highest performance server CPUs in the industry and have set more than 100 world records. Our newest EPYC processors feature up to 64 cores and deliver a 25% to 50% TCO advantage versus competitive offerings. As a result of our clear performance leadership and differentiated feature set, we are building momentum with cloud, enterprise and HPC customers. \\\\nIn cloud, Amazon AWS, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, OVHcloud, Twitter and Tencent all announced plans to deploy EPYC processors in their data centers. At our launch event, Google became the latest mega data center provider to adopt EPYC processors as they announced second-generation EPYC processors have been deployed across their internal infrastructure production data center environment and will also be used to power the Google Cloud platform. \\\\nIn enterprise, Dell, HPE and Lenovo more than doubled their AMD-powered server portfolio as they launched new platforms featuring second-gen EPYC processors, helping us add dozens of new telecom, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing and energy customers in the quarter. We also secured multiple new HPC wins in the quarter, including 3 separate U.S. Department of Defense supercomputers and what is expected to be the fastest scientific computer in the U.K. We expect server revenue to grow sequentially by a strong double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter as we continue ramping our second-generation EPYC processors. We remain on track to achieve our near-term goal of double-digit server CPU share by mid-next year. \\\\nIn summary, we are right where we want to be on our long-term strategic plan. We have the strongest product portfolio in our history. We executed our product launches and production ramps very well in the third quarter as our new products grow higher revenue, margin expansion and increase profitability. We\\'re on track to exit 2019 with another quarter of significant growth driven by the ramp of our 7-nanometer products and believe we are well positioned to build our momentum in 2020 and beyond as we deliver an even stronger set of leadership products that can drive sustained growth and increase share of the $75 billion market for high-performance Computing and Graphics technologies. \\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong third quarter financial results with revenue of $1.8 billion, up 18% quarter-over-quarter and our highest quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2005. The third quarter showcases our financial momentum and the strength of our business model with operating income and net income growing significantly year-over-year. Quarterly revenue was up 9% from a year ago as strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon gaming GPUs more than offset lower semi-custom sales. Gross margin of 43% was up 320 basis points from a year ago, our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year expansion. Operating expenses grew 13% year-over-year to $539 million primarily driven by increased R&D investments and support for our new product introductions. Operating income was $240 million, up $54 million or 29% from a year ago due to increased revenue from new higher margin products. Operating margin was 13%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. Net income was $219 million, up $69 million or 46% from a year ago. And diluted earnings per share was $0.18 per share compared to $0.13 per share a year ago. \\\\nNow turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.28 billion, up 36% year-over-year driven by strong client processor and gaming GPU sales. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $179 million compared to $100 million a year ago driven by higher Ryzen processor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-custom segment revenue was $525 million, down from $715 million the prior year. As anticipated, semi-custom revenue was lower in the third quarter as the market awaits next-generation AMD-powered game consoles from Sony and Microsoft. EPYC data center CPU revenue grew by over 50% sequentially driven by shipments of our second-generation product in the quarter. EESC segment operating income was $61 million compared to $86 million a year ago due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. I\\'m very pleased with the continuing improvement of our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, higher than the gross debt of $1.1 billion resulting in AMD being net cash positive. During the quarter, we retired $206 million of debt, which resulted in a loss of $40 million recorded on our GAAP income statement. The reduction in debt included $126 million of convertible senior notes in exchange for 16 million shares. Year-to-date, we have reduced gross debt by $441 million. Free cash flow was positive $179 million in the third quarter and cash flow from operations was $234 million. Inventory was $1 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter in anticipation of higher revenue in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million compared to $227 million a year ago driven by higher quarterly earnings. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $745 million and gross leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.5x. \\\\nNow turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $2.1 billion plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 48% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. The sequential and year-over-year increases are expected to be driven by growth in Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon processor sales offset by a further softening of semi-custom processor revenue. In addition, for Q4 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 44%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $535 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $22 million; and fourth quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.21 billion shares. \\\\nIn closing, we had an excellent third quarter and remain focused on ramping our leadership portfolio of high-performance products to deliver strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. \\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready to go ahead and poll for our first question, please.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First one for Lisa. You had mention the total cost of ownership in your prepared comments, and I wonder -- I guess, I could imagine that the total cost of ownership over a lifetime of a 7-nanometer server chip might be greater than the price of a server chip when compared to a 14-nanometer server chip. And so I\\'m wondering if you could maybe just clarify the comments you made on total cost of ownership and quantify, if that is the case, how you see it. And how many -- what percentage of your data center customers actually look at total cost of ownership in evaluating the products? Is it -- does everybody do that? Or do some just look at the price? And I\\'m wondering, like, what do you think that has -- impact that might have on the competitive pricing environment? That\\'s the first question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thanks for the question, Mark. So -- I mean maybe let me give some context on sort of the data center business for us, and then I\\'ll answer your question. Look, I think from what we see, there is a very strong value proposition for Rome. When you look at just what we\\'re able to do from just the amount of performance, the power consumption and then how that plays into total cost of ownership. We see it across all workloads, so whether you\\'re talking about a virtualized environment or you\\'re talking about high-performance computing or you\\'re talking about the Enterprise sort of workloads, we see a strong performance as well as strong total cost of ownership. To your exact question, I think, server purchases -- or server purchasers are very, I would say, sophisticated. And so in most cases, total cost of ownership is definitely in the conversation. And it\\'s not just about performance but performance at a given power level and also in terms of a given density. And that has played out in a number of our customer engagements. And so the overall point of -- we think that Rome is very well positioned. Price in and of itself is one factor, but I would say it\\'s not the primary factor. I think the performance, power, total cost of ownership are all important buying factors, and we\\'ve seen very, very strong engagement from customers across-the-board, across all workloads for these drivers.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And a follow-up, if I may, on the -- when you think about your share gain -- your potential to gain share as you look into 2020, can you talk about what you view as the biggest potential gating factors in that and like how you\\'re managing those potential factors? And I\\'m hoping you can talk to your view on availability of 7-nanometer wafers or -- and engineering support for your customers who are trying to put together solutions.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Sure, Mark. So a couple different questions there. Let me try to get through it. I will say, since our launch of Rome in August, we\\'ve had a very strong start. Now we had a full quarter of revenue here in the third quarter, and we saw that in sort of the ramp of units and revenue. What we are seeing is that the qualifications are going faster with the second-generation of EPYC than with the first generation, so customers are familiar with our platforms. In some cases, customers are doing drop-in platforms, and so they can take virtually the same or a very similar platform that they had for first-gen and drop-in the second-gen. They\\'re familiar with our architecture. And so I think, from a market share standpoint, we feel good about the transition from Naples to Rome. I think the platform readiness across our OEMs and number of platforms that we have across the major OEMs is also very strong, and we\\'re pleased with the set that are -- that have both new and existing platforms there. And so from the standpoint of where we are going in the fourth quarter into 2020, I think we feel very, very good about where we are with the data center customers. \\\\nAs it relates to customer support and all that stuff, like I said, customers are much, much more familiar with the architecture in the second-generation compared to the first generation. And that is good for the ramp of Rome. As it relates to -- I think you asked about the 7-nanometer ramp and the availability there, we had a very large ramp here in the third quarter with 7-nanometer. We essentially ramped 3 full product families, Ryzen, EPYC as well as our Radeon gaming product families, in the third quarter. And it went very well. We\\'re very pleased with it. It\\'s the fastest ramp that we have done certainly in recent memory. And going into the fourth quarter and into 2020, I think we feel very good about the availability of Rome as well as the rest of our products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Instanet.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Can you give us an idea of what your revenues were from 7-nanometer products in the September quarter and what you reckon they\\'ll be in the December quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think what I can say, David, and I\\'ll start. Maybe Devinder has some additional comments. The ramp for 7-nanometer has gone very quickly in -- here in the third quarter. When we look at overall new product revenue, certainly in the third quarter, we had a significant piece of that be 7-nanometer. That will increase again as we go into the fourth quarter as well. And so the way to think about it is, for our major product lines, we\\'re transitioning very fast from 14 to 7.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. And within your Computing and Graphics segment, that 36% sequential growth, could you give us an idea of how -- what client CPU sales grew sequentially and separately, what the PC GPU sales sequential growth was?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So if you look at the CG segment from a sequential standpoint, we saw the client CPUs increase the most, and those were certainly the driver being both desktop and mobile. Desktop was higher than mobile, but both grew very nicely. If you look at GPUs overall, they actually declined a bit sequentially, and that decline was primarily driven by data center GPUs, which declined just due to some of the buying cycles in the cloud. Overall, gaming did well. And we continue to expect that, as we go into the fourth quarter, you\\'ll see that the data center GPUs will increase as well, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that client and graphics would also increase.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Before I jump into questions, just congrats to Devinder on being cash positive. The -- Lisa, a couple questions on Rome. We\\'ve been tracking some of the strength at Google, Microsoft and Amazon, but I wonder if you might comment a little bit about the server business in China given some disruptions there, just overall CapEx and also, the OEM business that you\\'re now ramping with Dell, HP, and Lenovo, and how you expect those things to trend over the next couple of quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Matt, as we look -- so let me answer the first question as it relates to the cloud customers. I think we are very pleased with the cloud adoption. We are engaged across all major Tier 1 and many of the Tier 2 service providers, and I think we\\'re making good progress there. As it relates specifically to China, we are well engaged there in both cloud and enterprise. Obviously, there is a little bit of disruption due to some of the China customers that are on the entities list and we follow that closely. But as it relates -- overall, I think we\\'re -- we believe that there is strong pull for Rome both across cloud as well as Enterprise. On the enterprise side, what I will say is that the HPC market has been really good for us. And so we have won quite a few of the bids and they tend to be early adopters of the technology. And so that\\'s one indication of the strong value proposition. As we go into more general Enterprise, the launch of HPE, Dell and Lenovo as well as Supermicro and the other ODM platforms is broader than our -- the first generation of EPYC, and we\\'re seeing that in the pipeline that we see. So a lot of activity going on right now, and we feel really good about how that\\'s going to develop over the next couple of quarters in terms of Enterprise wins.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just as a follow-up from me on the client business. Obviously, a lot of progress that\\'s been made with the results that you\\'ve just put up. And I kind of go back to some comments made by your primary competitor on their call, I think, talking about tightness in their own 14-nanometer supply and also that they\\'ve maybe not addressed some of the lower tiers of the market, yet your ASPs are up quite strongly. I wonder how much some of the supply tightness from your competitor might have led to these gains versus sort of the merits of your own product. If there\\'s anything you could talk about that, Lisa, that would be really helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Sure, Matt. Well, the client business has really had a very strong year, I mean, if you look at how it\\'s played out over the last couple of quarters. I\\'ll say that, in our desktop portfolio, the third-gen Ryzen has done very, very well. It\\'s extremely well positioned. And where we\\'re seeing the highest demand is at the highest tier sort of in the Ryzen 9 and the Ryzen 7. And so that\\'s why you see the ASP strength in the business. Mobile is also ramping very nicely and what we\\'re seeing, again, in mobile is the mix of Ryzen is now a predominant mix of the business. And we\\'re seeing actually very nice momentum in commercial as well as our traditional consumer market, so we also see good sequential growth in ASPs there. There is some noise in the system as it relates to some supply constraints and all that stuff. I would view that as mostly -- again, it\\'s pockets at the low end. I don\\'t think it\\'s a significant driver of our business. Our business is driven primarily by our new platforms, the fact that we are in a number of premium platforms on both the notebook side as well as just the strength that we\\'re having in the DIY channel is there. And that\\'s contributing to the positive mix as well as the unit growth in the client business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the strong growth and execution. I had 2 questions as well. Lisa, first, on the data center business. I know you mentioned the target is still to be on track for double-digit kind of unit share sometime in the middle of next year. Could you help us level set as to where the share is in Q3 and what the target is in Q4 and if you have seen your competitor react to your server share gains in any way through pricing or other means?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Vivek, as you know, we don\\'t necessarily want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of server share. But what we will say is our -- the Q3 quarter was our highest units sort of with EPYC. And so we are seeing good strength and predominantly a very fast transition to Rome. We expect that to continue to grow as we go into Q4 and into the first half of next year. So this is about more platforms ramping and multiple platforms within a given customer. And you should see -- we saw a number of announcements around our launches here in Q3, and you should see additional announcements as we go into the fourth quarter as well as the first half of next year. \\\\nYour question about do we see any unusual activity from a competition standpoint. Look, our view is that the competition is aggressive, will always be aggressive and we\\'re counting on that. It\\'s a very competitive market out there. That being the case, I think we are feeling very good about how our product is positioned and also the readiness of the product. So the question earlier about are the platforms ready, how\\'s the customer support, I think it\\'s very strong. And I think our OEM and ODM partners have done a phenomenal job with the breadth of platforms, and that will help us continue to grow overall.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And for my follow-up, Lisa, I had kind of a longer-term conceptual question, which is it\\'s good to see growth margins improving and the cost discipline, but do you think this is the time to actually increase OpEx a lot and really go after maximizing footprint, right, adding more resources, more systems rather than trying to optimize profitability? I\\'m just curious to hear how you are looking at the puts and takes around whether you should be maximizing footprint rather than profitability at this level.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Well, it\\'s a good question, Vivek. I get asked it from time to time. But what you will see is I think we\\'re very cognizant of where we\\'re going. So in other words, the roadmap -- and I mean the long term sort of financial roadmap, I think we understand pretty well. We want to show leverage on both top and bottom line, and that\\'s certainly our goal. We did spend a little bit more this year than we originally planned, and that was frankly because the opportunities are very strong. And most of the additional spend is targeted at R&D, with the notion of platform investments, software investments to ensure that we capture the opportunities that we have. I think we have the right balance, Vivek. And certainly, as we go into 2020, we\\'ll continue to look at that balance. But I think we are very well balanced between top line and bottom line growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations, guys. Lisa, I guess, my first question is, can you help me understand a little bit about the traction you\\'re getting in the Enterprise market on both Ryzen and in EPYC? And kind of what milestones should we be looking at relative to that sort of vertical?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So the -- we\\'re very excited about the opportunities for us in the commercial space. And I will tell you, when we look at our go-to-market investments, we are putting a lot of feet on the street as well as just general go-to-market around commercial. Starting with Ryzen, I think you have seen and you should have seen that the number of commercial platforms that we have continues to get stronger, and it\\'s not just the number of platforms but the quality of the platforms. Certainly, Lenovo ThinkPad is a premium brand that is very key. We have very strong HP commercial offerings. We have additional desktops coming out as well. What we are seeing is good traction in the commercial space, and that is the stronger part of the PC market. And we\\'ll continue to talk about that. \\\\nAs it relates to new platforms, certainly as we refresh our mobile platform going into next year, I think you\\'ll see even stronger commercial offerings there. We\\'re investing heavily in security and manageability and all of those other aspects that are important in the commercial space. As it relates to EPYC in the Enterprise, I\\'m actually very encouraged with what we see in the Enterprise. We had originally said that we thought we would be more cloud -- sort of cloud would go first and then Enterprise would take longer. I think what we currently see is cloud is certainly a big driver of our business. But our Enterprise business is coming along very nicely. And I really would say that the key metrics there are more top tier brands adopting EPYC and talking about that publicly. We have had a number of engagements, and I mentioned earlier that the pipeline that we see in Enterprise across our top OEMs has increased very significantly just in the last sort of 2 months since we launched. So the awareness around EPYC as well as the awareness around these new platforms, I think, is strong, and we\\'ll continue to build that out as we go forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s helpful, Lisa. Then maybe for my follow-up. As we, the analyst community, look out to modeling 2020, the GPU/CPU is relatively straightforward relative to market share expectations we might have. I\\'m just kind of curious if you can give us some help on the semi-custom business, if it\\'s impacted by ASC 60? And also, we\\'ve got a new gaming cycle next year. I know you don\\'t want to preannounce customer product, but how should we think about the semi-custom business trending throughout 2020 in broad strokes?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I think it\\'s a good question, and we will certainly give you more guidance as we get into 2020. But the way to think about it at a high level is we are going through a product transition with semi-custom now. And in 2019, for example, we\\'ve had the unusual cycle, where the second half of 2019 is pretty soft for semi-custom compared to the first half. And what you should expect in 2020 is that, that would flip strongly. So I think both of our large customers have said that they\\'re planning a holiday 2020 launch. That would mean that the semi-custom business would be quite heavily weighted in the second half, so you should expect that revenue in the first half will be, again, quite soft with a strong recovery in the second half of the year. And the way I look at it is, the gaming business, the console business is a strong business for us. And so it will be one of the growth drivers as we go into 2020 and beyond.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First, I wanted to ask about gross margins. I mean, I guess, I\\'m glad to see them up. But given what\\'s going on with the mix, I mean, I think you said GPUs were down sequentially. We\\'ve got data center up more than 50%. Ryzen is growing. You have the Samsung IP in there. I guess, I\\'m just surprised not to see them up more both in the quarter as well as into Q4. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color about what\\'s driving that margin evolution given the positive drivers of mix that I think should be there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think if you look at it from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, if you\\'re talking about Q2 to Q3, you\\'re right about the mix of the product, in particular, with the ramp of the 7-nanometer products. And the margins are up. Last quarter, we had, call it 41%. And this time, it\\'s slightly above 43%. And that is fundamentally due to the new products that are ramping and obviously some benefit from the semi-custom business, it\\'s been down slightly in Q3 compared to Q2. So that\\'s that. And then as you get into the Q4 timeframe, in the guide at 44%, it\\'s driven by the new legacy products, demand for the high end of product -- of our product stack is driving a richer mix, and obviously, there\\'s little bit of benefit as Lisa said earlier with the softer semi-custom revenue. So I think overall...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I thought all those new products were supposed to have gross margins in aggregate of over 50% and they\\'re driving like a massive mix shift, and yet, you\\'ve only got gross margins up a couple of points. What am I getting wrong?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the numbers are coming out to be a couple of hundred basis points up on a quarterly basis with the ramp of the 7-nanometer product. I don\\'t think you get anything wrong. You have to look at the mix of the product relative to the total revenue of the company at the $1.8 billion, and I think that\\'s how it comes out, Stacy.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think, Stacy, maybe if this will help. In each of the product lines, we are certainly mixing up, and that\\'s why you see some of the ASP goodness. But you also have some legacy product, right? And we continue to sell some legacy product as well. And so that\\'s the -- that\\'s perhaps the other piece. But I think, as Devinder said, look, we\\'re very happy with the way that the gross margin has progressed. I think if you look at our long-term model, we had said 40 to 44 points, and we\\'ll be exiting the year at 44, and I think very well -- positions us well as we go into 2020 and turn over more of the product portfolio to the new products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the EPYC server ramp into next quarter. So you were up, you said, more than 50% this quarter. So that might be, what, $80 million to $100 million maybe sequentially, which is, I guess, good. Your competitor added almost $1.5 billion sequentially in data center this quarter. So when you say next quarter that you\\'re -- I guess, you did gain share. You\\'re up about 50%, their units were up 20% but even so. So when you\\'re saying, next quarter, you\\'re going to grow it by strong double digits on EPYC, do you think that that\\'s like better than the trend that we saw in Q3 as more stuff ramps? I mean, if we were up 50% sequentially in Q3, do you think we can be better than that in Q4? Is that was strong double-digit means? Or do you have a different meaning in mind?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, I think we have in mind strong double digits. So I would say -- and Stacy, I\\'m not being facetious, but again, there are all kinds of puts and takes. What I will say, though, is put in context that the product has basically been in markets since early August. And if you put that in context, and we\\'re saying that the transition is going quickly, and we have a number of new platforms that are -- literally, they\\'ve been in market 4 to 8 weeks. With the way the server cycle goes, I\\'m actually pretty happy with how it\\'s ramping. And I expect, as I said, that Q4 will be another strong quarter for us, and it\\'s just a matter of continuing to diligently ramp the platforms.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have a question and a follow-up as well. Sticking to the server, the EPYC ramp. I\\'m just curious, out of the gate, what kind of mix have you seen maybe skew towards the 48 and 64 core solutions? And what I\\'m really getting at is how do we think about the blended ASP trend on EPYC as Rome fully ramps?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Aaron, it\\'s fair to say that initially, out of the chute, we are seeing a higher mix to the higher end. So more 48 and 64 cores as a mix. I think those are very, very attractive products and really take the full advantage of the EPYC product line. We are seeing, as you might expect with that mix, that the Rome ASPs are showing lift versus the previous first-generation EPYC. As we go forward, you would expect that to build out a little bit more. So we have a full product portfolio for the server parts, but then, you also expect that you\\'ll get more Enterprise in that, and Enterprise tends to have a higher ASP. So the net of all that is, I can say, in the server market, we feel very good about where we\\'re positioned from an ASP standpoint. And from a sort of unit share to revenue share, I think they\\'re actually quite close.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then as just as a quick follow-up, maybe more of a model question. I think last quarter, you talked about the semi-custom business being down in the mid-30% range. You also talked about Samsung contributions being around $100 million for the full year. I\\'m just curious, is that still where we stand? And what was kind of the Samsung contribution this last quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So I think on the Samsung base, if you look at the second half, it\\'s approximately $100 million. Slightly about half was taken in Q3, and the other half will come in Q4. So that\\'s absolutely right.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then on the -- yes, on the semi-custom side, we had said last quarter that it would be down, let\\'s call it, mid-30s. It\\'s probably, when you look at it in aggregate for the second half of the year, it will be down a bit more than mid-30s. Let\\'s call it high-30s.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I had a follow-up question on your server CPU business. And I guess the question is, when you think about pricing and sort of the margin profile that you\\'re seeing in that business today, how does that compare with what you had planned for 6 or 9 months ago? Is this pricing and margin coming in pretty much in line with expectations or are they coming in a little bit better? And then as you think about the margin profile for that business going into 2020, given 7-nanometer potentially maturing into next year, given the mix and given the change in customer mix from cloud to Enterprise, should those 2 dynamics serve as tailwinds for your margin in that business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I would say that the margin mix, as we look here in the beginning of the ramp, is about what we expected. It\\'s about what we expected. So the only thing I would say, and I said it earlier, is the product mix is perhaps a little bit higher in the early part of the ramp. But overall, the margins are pretty close to what we expected. The pricing environment is pretty close to what we expected. And as we go into 2020, I think the other piece of it is that the business scale will increase as we grow the business. And so that actually helps to absorb some of the fixed costs as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And as a quick follow-up, your nearest competitor talked about pull-ins in their data center business, particularly in China, was there anything in the quarter that you thought was kind of abnormal from a customer activity standpoint on the client side or the server side? And if so, how big was that? And how should we think about kind of the implications into Q4 and potentially the early part of 2020?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. When we look at both the client and the server business, I wouldn\\'t say that we saw any significant pull-ins due to tariffs or other reasons. We monitor sort of certainly very closely the sell-in and sell-through trend. And we believe that what we\\'re seeing in terms of the growth of the business is actually just new platforms running -- ramping. And given where we are in the product cycle, that makes sense. And so I wouldn\\'t say that we saw any significance of pull-ins in the quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I just had 2. I guess first for Devinder. I realize you don\\'t want to provide any kind of 2020 numbers, but you were already asked this 100 different ways, so I may as well save you guys some time. So if I look at the first half of \\'20, is there any reason why the gross margins won\\'t be higher than they are in December quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We don\\'t even want to get into 2020. There are several product transitions in play this year, as you\\'ve heard in the prior questions. OEM, the semi-custom business, that\\'s in transition. We have obviously the rest of the business in transition with the ramp in 7 nanometers. Lisa reported some of the legacy products. So there\\'s a lot of puts and takes and I think we want to talk about 2020 once we get past 2019 and put it to bed, and we can come back and talk about 2020 in about 90 days from now.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Got you. And then secondly, just for Lisa here. There\\'s been a lot of articles just in terms of some firmware issues, there\\'s some software bugs and things out there. Can you maybe just help us address all of them at once and just kind of talk about what you guys did to fix them? Because we\\'re still seeing kind of articles pop up here and there, and I just want to make sure that there are no issues in terms of the software.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let me make sure I understand what you mean, Mitch. Which product line are you referring to? Or what are you exactly referring to?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So there have been specific articles with Ryzen, right, saying that there\\'s issues with the bios and things like that and performance metrics are a little bit lower. But then you guys kind of relate -- noted that you\\'ve improved them or fixed them, but we\\'re still kind of seeing them in the market even today, for example. So I just wanted to know in terms of what happened? And then secondly, if everything\\'s been resolved?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So your question was relative to the third generation of Ryzen. Look, I think, overall, when you look at the third-generation of Ryzen and the platforms that we\\'ve put out, we\\'re very, very pleased with how that ramp has gone. And when we look at the sales from a sell-through standpoint, we\\'re very pleased with where it is. There have been some platform sort of optimizations that we\\'ve done through working with our ODM partners and the motherboard partners to try to sort of improve the optimization of the maximum boost frequency, which is, I think, what you\\'re referring to. And that has largely been addressed over the last couple of weeks. But I would consider that more of an optimization versus any type of major update. And we\\'re going to continue to improve the platform. So you\\'re going to see that as is normal with a new platform, that we\\'ll continue to improve the platforms over time. But I will say that we\\'re very pleased with how third-gen Ryzen has done in the marketplace. And we\\'re excited with the launch of the 16-core 3950X as well as the Threadripper family in the next couple of weeks as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Operator, we have time for about 2 more questions, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarsh V. Kumar,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just a quick one. As you look at your leverages for gross margins, what would you consider as your greatest leverage? Is it just sales growth as you take share? Or is it more products going to 7-nanometer?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think, if you look at the products, definitely, the new products in the 7-nanometers are very good tailwinds for the gross margin. But also, the mix of the business comes into play. The more data center revenue we capture in terms of market share obviously helps the gross margin. The high end of the stack, in particular, in the client PC business, that helps the gross margin. So it\\'s basically those are the things that help the gross margin as we go forward from 2019.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarsh V. Kumar,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And as you look out, where do you think margins can go?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, we think that, as Lisa said earlier, when we painted our long-term target model, we painted 40% to 44% in the 2017 time frame. That\\'s what we said. We -- exiting, we had 44%, and we\\'ll come back and update that sometime in 2020.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think in the past, you\\'ve given the percentage of total revenue that was data center CPU and GPU combined. Can you give us that number?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I mean, as a percentage of revenue, it\\'s similar to what it has been the past few quarters, although the server portion was significantly higher as we saw -- as we said early, greater than 50% sequential increase and so was CPU revenue -- unit shipments and revenue, so that definitely helps.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, got it. Okay. And then, I guess, just a bigger picture question. In terms of the kind of competitive edge you have, some of it relates to process technology, but of course, your competitor could just go to TSMC to build CPUs as well. But I guess, there\\'s other parts that relate to your fundamental architecture, which is the chiplet, the memory density and your IPC advantage. So I guess can kind of break down -- Lisa, can you break down how much of the advantage really is process related versus how much is actually architecture related?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Timothy, the way I would answer that question is, look, we made a set of choices, and the set of choices include process technology, they include architecture, our chiplet architecture. They include sort of our overall system architecture. And I think we\\'ve made a set of good choices. Going forward, we are not relying on process technology as the main driver. We think process technology is necessary. It\\'s necessary to be sort of at the leading edge of process technology. And so today, 7-nanometer is our great node, and we\\'re getting a lot of benefit from it. We will transition to the 5-nanometer node at the appropriate time and get great benefit from that as well. But we\\'re doing a lot in architecture. And I would say that the architecture is where we believe the highest leverage is for our product portfolio going forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We\\'ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\\'d like to turn the floor back over for any further and closing comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you very much, operator.

Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Three years ago, we set out a strategic plan to reshape AMD to become a high-performance computing leader through great products, deep customer relationships and a simplified and focused business strategy. 2017 marked a key product and financial inflection point for AMD. Our newest wave of high-performance products and consistent execution created significant momentum for our business over the last year. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.48 billion grew 34% from the year-ago period, and we significantly expanded our gross margin and improved profitability. For the full year, we increased annual revenue by over $1 billion, resulting in 25% annual revenue growth. We expanded gross margin and achieved full year profitability.\\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment in the quarter, we delivered very strong Q4 results as we continued the ramp of our Ryzen CPU and Radeon Vega GPU products. Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 60%, and we significantly improved operating income from a year ago.\\\\nClient computing revenue increased both year-over-year and sequentially. We outperformed seasonality in Q4, driving strong double-digit sequential revenue and unit growth based on very strong sellout of Ryzen processors throughout the holiday season. We expanded our Ryzen CPU family further into the consumer market with the introduction of the AMD Ryzen Mobile processor with Radeon Vega graphics, combining the power of our Zen CPU and Vega GPU architectures into the fastest processor in the industry for ultra-thin notebooks. Ryzen Mobile-based notebooks are currently available from Acer, HP and Lenovo with multiple new systems expected from all top 5 PC manufacturers in the first half of this year.\\\\nIn graphics, we delivered our second straight quarter of record GPU revenue with significantly improved ASP and increased unit sales from a year ago, driven by strength across our entire graphics product portfolio. We saw strong demand for our Polaris products across both the gaming and blockchain markets, and Radeon Vega GPU revenue more than doubled from the prior quarter driven by strong gaming demand in the add-in-board channel as well as strength with strategic OEMs.\\\\nApple launched the new iMac Pro, the most powerful Mac ever made, featuring AMD\\'s Radeon Pro Vega product in the quarter. We also began shipments of a new semi-custom GPU that is integrated into an Intel multi-chip processor package. This semi-custom product opens up a complementary market for our high-performance graphics products and expands the power of Radeon graphics to more gamers and premium PC buyers.\\\\nOur professional graphics business had its best quarter ever based on growing data center sales highlighted by strong Radeon Instinct MI25 sales to a major cloud provider. For the full year, Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 54% over the prior year as we launched more than 40 new high-performance CPUs and GPUs.\\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 3% from a year ago driven by the ramp of our EPYC processors. Q4 server revenue and unit shipments increased sequentially and from a year ago as the market continues to qualify and deploy our family of high-performance EPYC processors. We closed dozens of new server deals in the quarter, securing key design wins with education, financial services and hosting companies.\\\\nWe also had several key announcements in the quarter as we continued to see a steady drumbeat of adoption. Microsoft Azure became the first public cloud instance powered by AMD with their L-series of virtual machines for storage-optimized workloads. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise began volume shipments of the EPYC-based ProLiant DL385 Gen10 server, which recently set world records for floating point performance. Baidu deployed AMD FX single-socket platforms into their data centers to power AI, Big Data and cloud computing services. And Dell EMC has completed the qualification phase for their EPYC-based systems and will be sharing more on launch plans shortly.\\\\nOur reentry into the server market remains on track with a steady ramp of new platforms and deployments across our OEM and hyperscale data center customers. Our semi-custom business performed as expected in the quarter as unit shipments declined from a year ago as we completed the fifth year of the current game console cycle.\\\\nBefore I close, I\\'d like to address the recent important security issues facing our industry. Security is and always has been a fundamental focus for AMD across all our products. We are vigilant about security in both our product design and throughout the product life cycle. As new exploits arise like we have seen with Spectre and Meltdown, we are dedicated to responding with speed and focus to keep our customers and partners informed and protected. As a reminder, we believe Meltdown is not apropos to AMD processors.\\\\nFor Spectre variant 1, we continue actively working with our ecosystem partners on mitigations, including operating system patches that have begun to roll out. We continue to believe that variant 2 of Spectre is difficult to exploit on AMD processors. However, we are deploying CPU microcode patches that, in combination with OS updates, provide additional mitigation steps. \\\\nLonger term, we have included changes in our future processor cores starting with our Zen 2 design to further address potential Spectre-like exploits. We continue to collaborate closely with the industry on these vulnerabilities and are committed to protecting AMD users from these and other security threats as they arise.\\\\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our quarterly and full year results. We made significant progress in 2017 as we completely reshaped AMD\\'s product portfolio and launched a highly competitive set of new products. In 2018, we expect to increase our momentum with the next wave of premium products and expanded go-to-market activities to increase our market penetration. \\\\nIn the client market, we will expand our Ryzen portfolio with new product launches, including: AMD Ryzen desktop processor with Radeon Vega graphics, which is expected to deliver the industry\\'s highest performance graphics engine in a desktop processor; our second-generation Ryzen desktop CPU based on our higher-performance 12-nanometer Zen Plus architecture; and for business notebooks, our AMD Ryzen PRO Mobile processors with Radeon Vega graphics.\\\\nWe are also expanding our go-to-market activities with our OEM and retail partners, and we expect to launch more than 60 new Ryzen OEM systems throughout 2018. In graphics, the launch of Radeon Vega Mobile products will expand our Radeon Vega lineup into high-end notebooks. Later this year, we plan to sample our first 7-nanometer Vega GPU optimized for machine learning. In addition, we will continue increasing our software investments around machine learning to address the growing demand for an open ecosystem in the GPU compute space.\\\\nIn the server market, we will continue to work closely with major cloud vendors and OEMs to ramp their first-generation EPYC-based systems while also completing key development milestones on our next-generation Zen 2-based server platforms. Our Zen 2 design is now complete, and we will be sampling to our customers later this year.\\\\n2018 is clearly a defining year for the ramp of our server business, and we remain focused on our goal of achieving double-digit market share in this important market segment. 2017 laid a solid foundation with strong financial results and significant progress towards achieving our long-term goals. I am even more excited about 2018 as we continue our journey to position AMD as one of the premier long-term growth companies in the tech industry.\\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter financial performance. Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2017 was a pivotal year for AMD. We grew annual revenue 25% over 2016 with revenue growth increasing every quarter on a year-over-year basis, culminating in growth of 34% in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, we expanded gross margin by 3 percentage points and achieved GAAP profitability for the year.\\\\nComputing and Graphics annual revenue grew 54% in 2017, while Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-custom annual revenue was flat. Both segments posted operating profits for the year, and it is particularly noteworthy that the Computing and Graphics segment was profitable for the first time in 6 years. Based on the overall strength of the business and our new high-performance products, we have set a strong foundation for achieving our long-term financial model.\\\\nNow let me turn to our results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Total revenue of $1.48 billion grew 34% year-over-year, driven by strong Radeon and Ryzen product demand. On a sequential basis, revenue declined 10%, better than expected, driven by seasonally lower semi-custom sales and partially offset by strong demand for new CPU and GPU products. Gross margin was 35%, expanding 3 percentage points year-over-year, primarily due to a larger portion of revenue coming from Computing and Graphics, driven by our new high-performance products.\\\\nOperating expenses were $412 million compared to $357 million a year ago. The increase was driven primarily by R&D and new product go-to-market investments, partially offset by an R&D credit related to a technology development agreement. Operating income was $103 million, up significantly from $26 million a year ago, and operating margin was 7%, up from 2% a year ago.\\\\nAMD received a onetime tax credit of $18 million as a result of U.S. corporate tax reform, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $8 million in the quarter. Net income was $88 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.08, as compared to a net loss of $8 million or $0.01 per share in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was $142 million compared to $60 million a year ago, and adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $445 million.\\\\nNow turning to fourth quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $958 million, up 60% year-over-year due to strong sales of our Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $85 million compared to a loss of $21 million a year ago. The strong improvement was due to higher revenue.\\\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $522 million, up 3% year-over-year, driven by server revenue. Operating income was $19 million, down from $47 million a year ago, primarily due to the absence of a licensing gain and ongoing R&D investments, partially offset by the benefit from a richer product mix.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.18 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $879 million in Q3 due to significantly higher cash flow from operations. Inventory was $739 million, down slightly from the prior year and down 7% from the prior quarter. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.7 billion.\\\\nIn the fourth quarter, we deployed cash to repurchase $38 million of long-term principal debt resulting in a total reduction of long-term debt of $138 million in 2017. Our gross leverage ratio has improvement from 10x in 2016 to 3.8x at the end of 2017.\\\\nFree cash flow was $339 million, up sharply from $32 million in the prior quarter. Q4 is typically our strongest cash flow quarter, and for the year, free cash flow was $45 million negative due to increased working capital in support of higher revenue.\\\\nBefore we turn to guidance, I want to highlight that we are adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard effective 2018. We are adopting this standard under the full retrospective method, which we believe is most helpful to our investors. For the full year 2017, the impact of the accounting change to revenue was immaterial, and we expect the impact to be immaterial on 2018 annual revenue.\\\\nFor the first quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.55 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year, primarily driven by the strength of the ramp of Ryzen GPU and EPYC products. For comparative purposes, under the new accounting method, Q1 \\'17 restated revenue was $1.18 billion and Q4 2017 restated revenue was $1.34 billion. In addition, for Q1 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 36%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $435 million or approximately 28% of revenue; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million; and inventory to be up sequentially in support of higher revenue.\\\\nFor 2018, we expect double-digit percentage growth in annual revenue, greater than 36% non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 28% of revenue. In addition, we expect a tax rate of approximately 10% of pretax income for 2018.\\\\nIn summary, we made significant progress in 2017. We are pleased with the momentum in our business and delivered outstanding top line revenue growth, margin expansion and achieved profitability for the year. We continue to make strong progress towards our long-term target financial model, and our goal in 2018 is to deliver significant revenue growth and increase profitability as we continue to invest in our multi-generational high-performance product road maps.\\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready for our first question.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Can you please give us the puts and takes for the Q1 guide? There are lots of moving parts, and so I think that would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Hans. Thanks for the question. So our Q1 revenue guidance was up 32% year-on-year, and if you take a look at that, it\\'s actually significantly better than our typical seasonality. Primarily, that\\'s due to the new product strength. So we see GPUs, Ryzen and EPYC, all up in Q1, and that\\'s contributing to the strong guidance. We do expect that the semi-custom business will be down in Q1 relative to the first quarter of 2017 just due to the fact that we\\'re in the sixth year of the cycle. So if you actually take the new product strength, the guidance is actually over 32% year-on-year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then the seasonality of semi-custom will continue to be weaker on a year-over-year basis for the rest of the year. Is that the way to model that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So what you should be -- expect with semi-custom is, on a full year basis, the revenue will be likely down compared to 2017 just due to where we are in the cycle, and units will be down. There will be a bit of an adjustment to the seasonality as we move over to the new accounting regulations with 606, and so we\\'ll see, let\\'s call it, a bit more revenue in the first half and a bit less revenue in the second half. So for the year, it is very similar, and then we\\'ll see a little bit of shift in the quarterly profile. But again, back to the -- your question -- your initial question on the Q1 revenue guidance, it is really driven by new product strength.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Following on from your answer to Hans\\' question, Lisa, can you give us some feel for the revenue, the new product momentum in terms of sales in the fourth quarter \\'17? And in particular, any numbers on Ryzen, EPYC or Vega? Absolute sales dollars or sequential growth in Q4 would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, David. So we had a very strong Q4. If you look at the overall business, it was up 34% year-on-year. If you look underneath that, the Computing and Graphics business was very strong. So we saw 17% sequential growth, significantly better than seasonality. That was up on client, particularly Ryzen desktop, had a very strong holiday. We also started initial shipments on Ryzen Mobile. And then on the graphics side, we saw strength in all product lines, so we saw strength in the channel for both gaming as well as blockchain. We saw strength in OEMs as we ramped Apple with our Vega processors. We also saw strength in professional graphics as we launched some GPU compute into the data center. So overall, those were the puts and takes. Semi-custom was down sequentially, and again, that\\'s as expected given the typical seasonality of the semi-custom business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And Devinder, it might have been nested in what you -- your prepared remarks. But do you expect your net debt will grow in the seasonally weak first half of 2018? And if so, how much might net debt go up?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Net debt, when you say net debt, just explain that, David. What do you mean by that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, debt minus cash. Presumably, well, do your cash balances fall during the first half of the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The debt levels came down in 2017 because we did repurchase some of the long-term principal debt to the tune of $134 million. And in the guidance we provided, we said that 2018 would be free cash flow positive. So if anything, I guess, the net debt, as you look at it, would come down as we get to the second half of 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          But any help in the first half? What happens to the net debt in the first half?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Typically, we invest in the business. As you saw in the guidance, I expect inventory to be up in Q1. And obviously, with the strength of the business momentum that Lisa just talked about, we\\'re prepared to go ahead and purchase product, a way for us to go ahead and fund the business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I was hoping you could give us a little more color on EPYC. Are we starting to get past pilot programs now and getting deployed into production environments? And can you give us a sense of the take of EPYC in the cloud versus enterprise?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Mark. So well, we are pleased with where we are with EPYC. We think we\\'ve made a very nice progress as in the fourth quarter. We announced that the large OEMs are now qualified and starting to ship to end customers. And so we have seen some very nice design wins in sales at some marquee end customers. If you look across education, financial services and the hosting business, those are looking good. On the cloud side, we have publicly talked about Microsoft Azure as well as Baidu adopting EPYC in their cloud of environments. We are working with a number of the other cloud players to adopt EPYC, and we\\'re working on some of the optimizations required there. So overall, we\\'re very pleased with the momentum. I think we always knew that there was a qualification cycle to go through, but we\\'ve gotten through some of the major qualifications here in the fourth quarter and especially as we looked in December, we actually closed a number of new deals with the platforms being available for sale.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s helpful. And then on the C&G side, very impressive growth. Can you give us a sense of to what extent that growth was driven by Ryzen products versus Radeon? And then on the Radeon side, can you give us a sense of what blockchain was to the contribution and how you\\'re viewing the sustainability of that? It seems like it\\'s getting consistently strong. So appreciate any updates on your view on that segment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Mark. So look, on the Computing and Graphics segment, we grew about $140 million sequentially, and if I look at that growth, it was across Ryzen and Radeon. If you look at blockchain in particular, our estimates are that it was about 1/3 of the growth, 1/3 of the $140 million, and then the rest of the 2/3 are around the GPUs -- the other segments of GPUs and Ryzen. When I look going forward, clearly, blockchain is a little bit of a fluid and dynamic market. We did see some strength as we went into December. We see strength as we\\'re going into the first quarter. I\\'m sure many of you have seen that the graphics channel is very low, and we\\'re certainly working to replenish that channel environment. So we think that graphics in general is going to be strong into the first half, and that\\'s some of what\\'s contributing to our strong Q1 guidance. But overall, my comments are we\\'re seeing nice momentum across Ryzen and all of the GPU segments, which is important for us as we go into 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          My first is on gross margin. Can you give us a feeling -- do you expect Q1 to be the trough for gross margins through the year given you\\'re guiding in line to maybe a little above for the year, where you\\'re guiding Q1? And can you give us some feeling on the puts and takes of gross margins as we go through the year, particularly around things like business mix, lower seasonality and lower growth on semi-custom versus some of the new products for example?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Stacy, I can take that, and then Lisa maybe can add. As we start the year, as Lisa said, we do see momentum from the new products, the Ryzen, the GPUs and EPYC, and the margin is up on a sequential basis. We\\'re starting off the year at 36%. We previously said that, for 2018, we expect margin to be greater than 36%, so it is a good start to the year, starting off well with a 36% guide. Obviously, the new products are having benefit then. And then the one thing I will add from what Lisa said earlier, in particular with the semi-custom business timing, is there is some incremental semi-custom revenue that gets recognized in Q1 as compared to the past from a timing in the year standpoint. But overall, I think the 36% is where we are starting off in Q1 and very pleased with that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Stacy, the only...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So you do believe Q...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sorry, go ahead.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I was just saying, so you do believe Q1 is probably a trough in terms of gross margins?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Clearly, Stacy, the first half of the year is usually the weaker half of our business because we are a consumer-led business. So as we -- starting off with 36% margin in Q1 is a good start. And we do expect that the new products will continue to ramp as we go through 2018. So I think that\\'s how we view the puts and takes going forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          For my follow-up, I know your competitors saw some unusual strength in the enterprise market and enterprise spending in Q4. I understand your exposure at this point to those enterprise wins is certainly less. But what are you seeing in terms of enterprise ramp? Are you seeing anything unusual or more or less sustainable in terms of strength versus what you\\'d ordinarily expect to see this time of the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Stacy. I think your question is about the market, and our market share is still relatively low. So our exposure with EPYC is there\\'s a lot of activity, so there\\'s a significant amount of activity with customers, both in all segments, cloud and enterprise. Although I wouldn\\'t say that, that\\'s necessarily a market trend. I would say that\\'s sort of where we are with our EPYC qualifications and ramp. And so we don\\'t see -- for example, we don\\'t see that Q4 was especially strong, and there will be a drop-off in Q1. In fact, we expect that EPYC should grow as we go through Q1 and the rest of 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          For my first one, just a clarification. I know it\\'s been off a few times. But what would your Q1 sales and gross margin outlook have been under the older accounting methodology?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Vivek, we\\'re adopting the new revenue accounting standard under what is the full retrospective method because we believe this is most helpful to the investors, and for good measure, we have provided the Q1 \\'17 and Q4 \\'17 on a restated -- we restated the revenue and obviously, the Q1 2018 guidance under 606. We will publish the restated numbers as part of our 10-K. And from a Q1 2018 standpoint, if you look at the numbers, let\\'s say, you compare to Q4 \\'17 on a seasonal -- on a sequential basis, the revenue is up quarter-on-quarter, and largely that\\'s the strength of the new products in Q1 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right. I ask that -- you\\'re starting the year at a very strong 30%-plus base, and you\\'re saying double-digit growth for the year. And double digit is a very, very wide range. So Lisa, could you help us at least get some level set of what double-digit growth means for the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we are starting the year strong, Vivek. I think maybe to give you a little bit more color on your question as it relates to the Q1 guidance. We are -- as Devinder said, we are giving all guidance and forward-looking comments on 606. However, the largest impact, particularly as it relates to revenue, is really sort of the semi-custom business. As you know, our custom business is a little bit unique because it\\'s a singular customer, and so under the new revenue recognition rules, we would actually take revenue with non-cancelable POs. So that impact in the first quarter sort of guidance would have been about, let\\'s call it, $100 million or about thereabouts. And so that might help you calibrate where we are. I think the -- any way you look at it, the new product strength is the most important factor, but we also want to be clear on what the accounting rule impact would be. Does that help you, Vivek?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Lisa, very helpful. And for my follow-up, traditionally, there has been a very large price delta between in your and Intel product, sometimes 50%, 60% plus on PCs and servers. As you look ahead with the new products, are you starting to see some of that price conversion? Like, are you being positioned in segments where you had not been previously, so you can get the benefit of much better ASPs than you\\'ve had historically?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Vivek, absolutely. So if we look at 2017 full year and look at our ASPs in the client business, the graphics business and the server business, albeit it\\'s early, we are definitely seeing a significant ASP expansion as a result of the fact that our products are now covering the higher end of the market. So we\\'re competing very well in the higher end of the market. I expect that there\\'s still a delta, but that delta is converging given our product coverage.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, while the year-over-year gross margin improvement has been strong both in the calendar sort of third quarter, fourth quarter and now on the guide in the first quarter, the sequential gross margin leverage is perhaps a little bit less than I would have thought, especially as you move into Q4 and Q1 and semi-custom comes down. Now I know there\\'s been sort of a lag effect as Ryzen grows as a percent of the mix, but maybe you can help me understand where we are as far as Ryzen as a percent of the mix being a positive influence on gross margin. And then just relative to your long-term gross margin target of 40% to 44%, how far does Ryzen get you before you become more dependent on EPYC ramps later this year into 2019 and beyond?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So a lot of different questions there, John. Let me try to unpack it there. So let\\'s talk about sort of Ryzen and sort of the margin both Q4 and Q1. On the Ryzen -- to give you sort of a flavor of where we are in terms of the new product ramp, Ryzen Q4 was probably in the high 40s percentage of our overall client business, and we expect that, that will be over 50% starting in the first quarter of 2018. And so that ramp definitely helps, and it\\'s part of our sequential 100 basis point improvement from Q4 to Q1. I think in terms of overall new product revenues, if you take Ryzen, EPYC and then our new graphics products in totality, in Q4, they were about 33% of our revenue, and we expect that to ramp nicely as we go into 2018. So I think we are getting the margin leverage. The margin leverage certainly from Q4 to Q1 is due to the fact that we have strong products. And the thing that\\'s a little bit different this quarter is because we are guiding under 606, and as a result of that, semi-custom, which is typically seasonally down Q4 to Q1, in this case, is actually up a little bit Q4 to Q1. And so that\\'s a headwind on the margin, but overall, we\\'re still up 100 basis points. Does that kind of get to the gist of your question?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, that\\'s helpful, Lisa. And then maybe a second question just on the OpEx. Revenue for the calendar first quarter, significantly above where the Street was expecting but so was OpEx. And I\\'m curious, is there any sort of unusual expenses around Spectre or Meltdown that\\'s going on? And then to continue that, for the full year, you\\'re guiding OpEx about in line with your long-term target. So is there opportunity that your long-term target can come down and maybe 28% of revenue on OpEx comes down over time? Or how should we think about that leverage?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So look, so relative to OpEx, I think our long-term guidance was 26% to 30%. Calendar year 2017, we were roughly approximately 30% if you look at it for the full year basis. We\\'re guiding 2018 to approximately 28%, so we\\'re starting to see some of that leverage granted we\\'re starting off in Q1, which is usually a low quarter for us. And then as we go forward, we\\'re certainly looking at more leverage in the model, but we are investing in sort of the key new products. We are investing in software, and I think that\\'s absolutely the right thing for us to do. As it relates to any unusual expenses with Spectre and Meltdown, there are no particular unusual expenses related to that. I think what we are doing is we\\'re investing in the business. We believe strongly in the product road map that we have, and given the significant revenue growth, we believe we can afford to invest in the business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the product that you announced with Intel over the course of Q4, the semi-custom graphics product. I guess, interesting to see a few companies working together. Can you put that product into context for us? Are there things that you could do going forward? And then just is that going to be in the semi-custom part of revenues or in the compute part?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Joe. So the product that we announced with Intel was a semi-custom graphics product. So what we\\'re doing is we\\'re selling silicon to them. And then they\\'re packaging it in a multi-strip module, and they\\'re marketing it and selling to end customers. From my standpoint, this is an excellent way to get more Radeon GPUs in as many applications as possible. And so our strategy is we\\'ll build our own standard products. We will build custom products for customers and then look for how do we get Radeon in as many places as possible. For this graphics revenue, because it\\'s very similar to discrete graphics, we\\'re actually reporting it in the Computing and Graphics segment, and we did see some initial revenue from that in Q4. But it is -- as I said, it\\'s a semi-custom chip that is sold to them with their -- to be packaged with their products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, one for you back on the crypto side of things. It was great to see the incremental color that you gave. But is there any way you could give an absolute dollar amount, whether it be in the fourth quarter or just full year \\'17 and how much you believe crypto contributed to your revenues?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Ross. So it is hard to estimate. I think we said before it\\'s hard to estimate just given some of the crypto -- sort of GPUs are sold through the same channels as our gaming channel. I previously said we thought it was about mid-single digits percentage of our annual revenue. It may be a little bit higher than that. Let\\'s call it 1 point or so, but it\\'s really a lot of our growth is outside of the blockchain market. What we see in the market though is, because I know there\\'s a lot of conversation about this out in the market, it is an important market. I mean, we\\'re now seeing it from the standpoint of there is a lot of dynamic movement in the market, but it is consuming a lot of GPUs. It\\'s a good part of our business, and we intend to sort of work with the large players to better forecast that business going forward. But I don\\'t want that to take away from the fact that we had significant growth in the GPU business outside of blockchain as we really ramped the Vega product line, as we ramped our GPU compute product line, as we ramped our Apple. And so those are all important pieces of our GPU story.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Perfect, that\\'s helpful. As my follow-up, I wanted to go back to a statement you said in answering a prior question about the semi-custom business being up sequentially and then saying it was about $100 million benefit. Is that up sequentially you\\'re talking about relative to the fourth quarter pre or post the ASC adjustment? Just trying to tie this altogether and kind of get the moving parts behind your guidance because it is much higher than, I think, where many of us expected it to be.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So let me try, and Devinder may keep me -- make sure that we\\'re clear here. So the $100 million that I referenced was relative to the Q1 \\'17 adjustment, which was approximately $200 million or so. If you look at it on a sequential basis, it won\\'t be up $100 million. It\\'ll be up somewhat less than that, but typically, we\\'re quite -- we\\'re down quite a bit in semi-custom. And so it is a different seasonal pattern than we would normally see.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Brett Simpson from Arete Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBrett William Simpson,  Arete Research Services LLP - Senior Analyst    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I just had a question on crypto. I mean, if I look at the amount of hash compute being added to Ethereum in January, I mean, it\\'s more than the whole of Q4. So we\\'ve seen a big start to the Q1. So I\\'m just wondering, what\\'s the balance or the sort of mix in your C&G division between GPU and CPU sort of looking at Q4 and how it changes at Q1? And is there any sort of acute shortages here? I mean, can your foundry partners -- do they have the capacity to support you with the ramp of GPUs at the moment? And is there enough HBM2 DRAM to source as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, right. So in relation to your question about client and graphics, look, both the client business and the graphics business grew sequentially in Q4. So both of them were strong businesses for us, and as I said, there are -- crypto was one driver, but there were numerous other drivers as well. Relative to just where we are in the market today, for sure, the GPU channel is lower than we would like it to be. So we are ramping up production. At this point, we\\'re not limited by silicon per se, so our foundry partners are supplying us. There are shortages in memory, and I think that is true across-the-board, whether you\\'re talking about GDDR5 or you\\'re talking about high-bandwidth memory. We continue to work through that with our memory partners, and that will be certainly one of the key factors as we go through 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBrett William Simpson,  Arete Research Services LLP - Senior Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And just a follow-up on 7-nanometer. I mean, a lot being talked about at 7 with the TSMC ramping fairly shortly and also Intel being perhaps a little delayed on 10-nanometer. Can you talk about what your plans are for 7-nanometer in 2018? Can you ship a CPU platform based on 7-nanometer in -- this year? Or is there -- are you also seeing some delays in 7 with your foundry partners?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So relative to 7, 7 is a very important node for us. We\\'re doing very active development to the 7 across our GPU and our CPU portfolio. Relative to shipment dates, I\\'ll wait until we get closer to production before we talk about that. But what we have said is that we will sample a GPU here in 2018 targeted at machine learning, and that will be in 7-nanometer technology. And we are also actively working on CPU products in the 7-nanometer technology as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Tristan Gerra from Baird.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTristan Gerra,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You\\'ve mentioned that you expect very strong demand from blockchain in the first half. How aggressive are you in terms of embedding that type of trend in your Q1 guidance? Just trying to get a sense of the contribution from that segment in your Q1 guidance. And also, is the margin profile any different than the rest of your GPU business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So I think as we said on the Q1 guidance, it is really strength across our new products, so it\\'s not just the blockchain or crypto conversation. That\\'s one factor, but we do see strength across the rest of our GPU business as well as our CPU business with Ryzen and EPYC. So of course, we take into account what we believe the demand will be here in the first quarter, and we think we\\'re fairly balanced with that. And overall, given the current lead times, I think we have good visibility into what the order pattern is and so on and so forth. So I think the key point is crypto is strong right now but we do believe that it is a very dynamic environment, and so we have to watch that step very closely. And there are numerous other product drivers in our Q1 guidance, including the CPU business, which is an important driver.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTristan Gerra,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And as a quick follow-up, in terms of the ramp of EPYC, should we look at a linear ramp throughout this year? Or is there more of an inflection point at any given time that you would expect or any given quarter that you would expect this year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I do expect a steady ramp of EPYC as we go through the year. Our target is to be at mid-single-digit unit share by the end of 2018, and so there would be significant revenue from EPYC as we are in the second half of \\'18. But certainly, I would expect a steady ramp throughout the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSrinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just a couple of clarifications. First, I guess, Devinder, the accounting change, you kind of gave us an explanation how the seasonality works for Q1. I\\'m just curious as to how your seasonality changes as we go into Q2, Q3 and Q4 because, historically, you were down in Q1 and kind of flattish in Q2 and then up in Q3 and Q4. So just trying to understand how the accounting change impacts that seasonality.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think the more significant change is from our semi-custom business. So we\\'re going to see acceleration of revenue in the first half as opposed to where it used to be weighted towards the second half of the year. And that\\'s just a timing issue within the year. Annually, there\\'s not much impact. It\\'s pretty immaterial from that standpoint. But timing-wise, you will see recognition of revenue earlier in Q1 and Q2, and then, obviously, we still have it in Q3 and Q4. So seasonality for the semi-custom business changes. As Lisa stated earlier, typically, Q4 to Q1 is down, and now Q4 to Q1 is up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. But I would add, though, just for that seasonality question. I think what you\\'ll see is perhaps a little bit of a flatter profile. We used to have a very high peak in Q3, and now I think you\\'ll see a little bit of a flatter profile with sort of second quarter still being higher than first quarter, third quarter or higher than second quarter, and then fourth quarter, we would expect to be down.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSrinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And then, Lisa, just another clarification on Ryzen. Obviously, you\\'re seeing very strong ramps. I would have expected you to see a little bit of ASP benefit in Q4, but it looks like ASPs came in flattish. I\\'m just curious as to why they\\'re only flat, not up sequentially.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure. So I think when you look at the ASPs, it\\'s very dependent on the actual mix. And so underneath the client ASPs, we actually saw desktop a little bit lower, and that\\'s because the desktop sales in the holiday season were a little bit more weighted to Ryzen 3, which has a lower ASP than some of the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7. But we actually saw mobile ASPs up because we saw the beginning of the shipments of Ryzen Mobile, which pulled ASPs up. So it\\'s just a -- the detailed mix of the business. But overall, I think we saw very strong growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Devinder, I just had a question on free cash flow since I pester you so much on it. Good to see a solid quarter on that front. But my question really is how should we -- you\\'ve guided for an increase in free cash flow for next year. Should we expect the same kind of dynamic that you\\'ve had this year, seasonality in Q4? And then also, you had to build up working capital and inventory specifically because of the dynamics on memory and the tightness earlier on the year. So what are some of the puts and takes there if you could please help us with that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think as you rightly observed, I mean, our strong quarter from an overall standpoint where cash is concerned, and cash from operations are very strong in Q4 and free cash flow was $339 million, ending at the $1.18 million, there is typically pressure on cash in the first half of the year just given the fact that the revenue is there, and we buy the wafers to support the business. And then it gets better in the second of the year. As far as working capital is concerned, it\\'s a little bit early to tell. I think it depends upon how the revenue unfolds. Obviously, we have managed it pretty well, but supporting the higher revenue from the strength of the business is going to be the key from that standpoint. But to your point, I do feel very good as to where the cash ended up. I do feel very good with how we have done from managing the balance sheet for working capital and the debt levels. And 2018, we are guiding to free cash flow being positive for the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And a quick follow-up for you, Lisa. If we look at the double-digit growth for this year, what are the absolute dollar drivers in terms of which product categories do you expect within EPYC GPUs for machine learning or for Ryzen if you were to rank order those in terms of absolute dollar impact this year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So if I were to rank order those, I would say that both EPYC and Ryzen, as we deploy Ryzen more into the notebook form factor, which is very significantly ramped, are very key for that. I think GPUs in machine learning are also a strong growth driver for us. But just given sort of where we are from the base that we\\'re starting with, I think the other 2 are just more significant.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa. Thank you, Devinder, and to everyone who joined our call today. We appreciate you joining the fourth quarter conference call. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That does conclude today\\'s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Before Colette describes our quarterly results, I\\'d like to thank those who are on the front lines of this crisis, first responders, health care workers, service providers, who inspires every day with their bravery and selflessness. I also want to acknowledge the incredible efforts of our colleagues here at NVIDIA. Despite many challenges, they have barely broken stride during one of the busiest periods in our history.  \\\\nOur efforts related to the virus are focused in 3 areas. First, we\\'re taking care of our families and communities. We\\'ve pooled in raises by 6 months to put more money in our employees\\' hands, and NVIDIA and our people have donated thus far more than $10 million to those in need.  \\\\nSecond, we\\'re using NVIDIA\\'s unique capabilities to fight the virus. A great deal of science being done on COVID-19 uses NVIDIA technology for acceleration when every second counts. Some of the many examples, including sequencing the virus, analyzing drug candidates, imaging the virus at molecular resolution with cryo-electron microscopy and identifying elevated body temperature with AI cameras.  \\\\nAnd third, because COVID-19 won\\'t be the last killer virus, we need to be ready for the next outbreak. NVIDIA technology is essential for the scientific community to develop an end-to-end computational defense system, a system that can detect early, accelerate the development of a vaccine, contain the spread of disease and continuously test and monitor.  \\\\nWe are racing to deploy the NVIDIA Clara computational health care platforms, Clara Parabricks can accelerate genomics analysis from days to minutes. Clara Imaging will continue to partner with leading research institutes to develop state-of-the-art AI models to detect infections, and Clara Guardian will connect AI to cameras and microphones and hospitals to help overloaded staff watch over patients.  \\\\nWe completed the acquisition of Mellanox on April 27. Mellanox is now NVIDIA\\'s networking brand and business unit and will be reported as part of our data center market platform, and Israel is now one of NVIDIA\\'s major technology centers.  \\\\nThe new NVIDIA has a much larger footprint in data center computing, end-to-end and full-stack expertise in data center architectures and tremendous scale to accelerate innovation. NVIDIA Mellanox are a perfect combination and position us for the major forces shaping the IT industry today, data center scale computing and AI.  \\\\nFrom micro service cloud applications to machine learning and AI, accelerated computing and high-performance networking are critical to modern data centers. Previously, a CPU compute node was the unit of computing. Going forward, the new unit of computing is an entire data center. The basic computing elements are now storage servers, CPU servers and GPU servers, and are composed and orchestrated by hyperscale applications that are serving millions of users simultaneously. Connecting these computing elements together is the high-performance Mellanox networking. This is the era of data center scale computing. And together, NVIDIA Mellanox can architect end to end. Mellanox is an extraordinary company, and I\\'m thrilled that we\\'re now one force to invent the future together.  \\\\nNow let me turn the call over to Colette.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Jensen. Against the backdrop of the extraordinary events unfolding around the globe, we had a very strong quarter. Q1 revenue was $3.08 billion, up 39% year-on-year, down 1% sequentially and slightly ahead of our outlook, reflecting upside in our data center and gaming platforms.  \\\\nStarting with gaming. Revenue of $1.34 billion was up 27% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. We are pleased with these results, which exceeded expectations in the quarter, marked by the unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19.  \\\\nLet me give you some color. Early in Q1, as the epidemic unfolded, demand in China was impacted with iCafes closing for an extended period. As the virus spread globally, much of the world started working and learning from home, and gameplay surged. Globally, we have seen 50% rise in gaming hours played on our GeForce platform, driven both by more people playing and more gameplay per user.  \\\\nWith many retail outlets closed, demand for our products has shifted quite efficiently to e-tail channels globally. Gaming laptops revenue accelerated to its fastest year-on-year growth in 6 quarters. We are working with our OEMs, channel partners to meet the growing needs of the professionals and students engaged in working, learning and playing at home. In early April, our global OEM partners announced a record new 100 NVIDIA GeForce-powered laptops with availability starting in Q1 and the most to ship in Q2. These laptops are the first to use our high-end GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and 2070 SUPER GPUs, which have been available for desktop since last summer.  \\\\nIn addition, OEMs are bringing to market laptops based on the RTX 2060 GPU at just $999, a price point that enables a larger audience to take advantage of the power and features of RTX, including its unique ray tracing and AI capabilities. These launches are well-timed as mobile and remote computing needs accelerate.  \\\\nThe global rise in gaming also lifted sales of NVIDIA Nintendo Switch and our console business, driving strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year. We collaborated with Microsoft and Mojang to bring RTX ray tracing to Minecraft, the world\\'s most popular game with over 100 million gamers monthly and over 100 billion total views on YouTube. Minecraft with RTX looks astounding with realistic shadows and reflections. Light that reflects, refracts and scatters through surfaces as naturalistic effects like fog. Reviews for it are off the charts. Ars Technica called it a jaw-dropping stunner, and PC World said it was glorious to behold.  \\\\nOur RTX technology stands apart, not only with our 2-year lead in ray tracing but with its use of AI to speed up and enhance games using the Tensor Core silicon on our RTX class GPUs. We introduced the next version of our AI algorithm called Deep Learning Super Sampling. In real time, DLSS 2.0 can fill the missing bits from every frame, doubling performance. It represents a major step function from the original, and it can be trained on nongaming-specific images, making it universal and easy to implement.  \\\\nThe value and momentum of our RTX GPUs continue to grow. We have a significant upgrade opportunity over the next year with the rise and tide of RTX-enabled games, including major blockbusters like Minecraft and Cyberpunk. Let me also touch on our game streaming service, GFN, which exited beta this quarter. It gives gamers access to more than 650 games with another 1,500 in line to get onboarded. These include Epic Games, Fortnite, which is the most played game on GFN; and other popular titles such as CONTROL, Destiny 2 and League of Lighting in the fall. Since launching in February, GFN has added 2 million users around the world, with both sign-ups and hours of gameplays boosted by stay-at-home measures. GFN expands our market reach to the billions of gamers with underpowered devices. It is the most publisher-friendly, developer-friendly game streaming service with the greatest number of games and the only one that supports ray tracing.  \\\\nMoving to Pro Visualization. Revenue was $307 million, up 15% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially. Year-on-year revenue growth accelerated in Q1 driven by laptop workstations and Turing adoption.  \\\\nWe are seeing continued momentum in our ecosystem for RTX ray tracing. We now have RTX support for all major rendering visualization and design software packages, including Autodesk Maya, Dassault\\'s CATIA, Pixar\\'s RenderMan, Chaos Group\\'s V-Ray and many others. Autodesk has announced that the latest release of VRED, its automotive 3D visualization software, supports NVIDIA RTX GPUs. This enables designers to take advantage of RTX to produce more like-life designs in a fraction of the time versus CPU-based systems. Over 45 leading creative and design applications now take advantage of RTX, driving a sustained upgrade opportunity for Quadro-powered systems while also expanding their reach.  \\\\nWe see strong demand in verticals, including health care, media and entertainment and higher education, among others. Higher health care demand was fueled in part by COVID-19 related research at Siemens, Oxford and Caption Health. Caption Health received FDA clearance for an update to its AI-guided ultrasound, making it easier to perform diagnostics-quality cardiac ultrasounds. And in media and entertainment, demand increased as companies like Disney deployed remote workforce initiatives.  \\\\nTurning to automotive and robotic autonomous machines. Automotive revenue was $155 million, down 7% year-on-year and down 5% sequentially. The automotive industry is seeing a significant impact from the pandemic, and we expect that to affect our revenue in the second quarter as well, likely declining about 40% from Q1.  \\\\nDespite the near-term challenges, our important work continues. We believe that every machine that moves someday will have autonomous capabilities. During the quarter, Xpeng introduced the P7, an all-electric sports sedan with innovative Level 3 automated driving features, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier AI compute platform. Our open, programmable, software-defined platform enables Xpeng to run its proprietary software while also delivering over-the-air updates for new driving features and capabilities. Production deliveries of the P7 with NVIDIA DRIVE begin next month.  \\\\nOur Ampere architecture will power our next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE platform called Orin, delivering more than 6x the performance of Xavier Solutions and 4x better power efficiency. With Ampere scalability, the DRIVE platform will extend from driverless robotaxis all the way down to in windshield driver assistant systems sipping just a few watts of power. Customers appreciate the top-to-bottom platform all based on a single architecture, letting them build one software-defined platform for every vehicle in their fleet.  \\\\nLastly, in the area of robotics, we announced that BMW Group has selected the new NVIDIA as a robotics platforms to automate their factories, utilizing logistic robots built on advanced AI computing and visualization technologies.  \\\\nTurning to data center. Quarterly revenue was a record $1.14 billion, up 80% year-on-year and up 18% sequentially, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Announced last week, the A100 is the first Ampere architecture GPU. Although just announced, A100 is in full production, contributed meaningful to Q1 revenue and demand is strong. Overall, data center demand was solid throughout the quarter. It was also broad-based across hyperscale and vertical industry customers as well as across workloads, including training, inference and high-performance computing. We continue to have solid visibility into Q2.  \\\\nThe A100 offers the largest leap in performance to date over our 8 generations of GPUs, boosting performance by up to 20x over its predecessor. It is exceptionally versatile, serving as a universal accelerator for the most important high-performance workloads, including AI training and inference as well as data analytics, scientific computing and cloud graphics.  \\\\nBeyond its leap performance and versatility, the A100 introduces new elastic computing technologies that make it possible to bring rightsized computing power to every job. A multi-instance GPU capability allows each A100 to be partitioned into as many as 7 smaller GPU instances. Conversely, multiple A100 interconnected by our third-generation NVLink can operate as one giant GPU for ever larger training tasks. This makes the A100 ideal for both training and for inference. The A100 will be deployed by the world\\'s leading cloud service providers and system builders, including Alibaba cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud platform, HPE and Microsoft Azure, among others. It is also getting adopted by several supercomputing centers, including the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the J\\\\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre in Germany and Argonne National Laboratory.  \\\\nWe launched and shipped the DGX A100, our third-generation DGX and the most advanced AI system in the world. The DGX A100 is configurable from 1 to 56 independent GPUs to deliver elastic software-defined data center infrastructure for the most demanding workloads from AI training and inference to data analytics.  \\\\nWe announced 2 products for edge AI: the EGX A100 for larger commercial off-the-shelf servers; and the EGX Jetson Xavier NX for micro-edge servers. Supported by full AI optimized cloud, native and secure software, the EGX platform is built for AI computing at the edge. With the EGX, hospitals, retail stores, farms and factories can securely carry out real-time processing of the massive amounts of data streaming from trillions of edge sensors. NVIDIA EGX makes it possible to securely, deploy and manage and update fleets of servers remotely. EGX is also ideal for the massive computational challenge of 5G networks, which we are working on with our partners like Ericsson and Mavenir.  \\\\nAdditionally, we announced CUDA 11 and other important software harnessing the A100\\'s performance and universatility (sic) [universality] to accelerate 3 of the most complex and fast-growing workloads: recommendation systems, conversational AI and data science.  \\\\nFirst, NVIDIA Merlin is a deep recommendator (sic) [recommender] application framework that enables developers to quickly build state-of-the-art recommendation systems, leveraging our pretrained models. With billions of users and trillions of items on the Internet, deep recommendators are the critical engine powering virtually every internet service.  \\\\nSecond, NVIDIA Jarvis is a GPU-accelerated application framework that makes it easy for developers to create, deploy and run end-to-end real-time conversational AI applications that understand terminology unique to each company and its customers using both vision and speech. Demand for these applications are surging. Amid the shift to working from home, telemedicine and remote learning.  \\\\nAnd third, in the field of data science and data analytics, we announced that we are bringing end-to-end GPU acceleration to Apache Spark, an analytics engine for big data processing that uses more than 500,000 data scientists worldwide. Native GPU acceleration for the entire Spark pipeline, from extracting, transforming and loading the data to training to inference, delivers the performance and the scale needed to finally connect the potential of big data with the power of AI. Adobe has achieved a 7x performance improvement and a 90% cost savings in an initial test using GPU-accelerated data analytics with Spark.  \\\\nOur accelerated computing platform continues to gain momentum, underscored by the tremendous success of GTC Digital, our annual GPU technology conference, which shifted this spring to an online format. More than 55,000 online developers and AI research registered for the online event, which includes hundreds of hours of free content from AI practitioners and industry experts who leverage NVIDIA\\'s platforms.  \\\\nOur ecosystem is now 1.8 million developers strong. Times like these truly test a computing platform\\'s metal in the utility it brings to scientist racing for solutions. Researchers around the world are deploying our GPU computing platform in the fight against COVID-19. Scientists are combining AI simulation to detect changes in pneumonia cases, sequence, the virus and seek effective biomolecular compounds for a vaccine or treatment.  \\\\nThe first breakthrough came from researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and National Institute of Health, who used the GPU-accelerated application to create the first 3D atomic scale map of virus using NVIDIA GPUs. This was followed by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who screened 8,000 compounds to identify 77 promising drug targets using the world\\'s fastest supercomputer, Summit, which is powered by more than 27,000 NVIDIA GPUs.  \\\\nThe V100 GPUs at Oak Ridge are in high demand as they can analyze 17 million compound protein combinations in a day. They\\'ll help understand the virus spread pattern, the University of California, San Diego, researchers ported their microbiomic analysis software to GPUs in the San Diego supercomputing cluster of 500x analysis speed up from what some people are more susceptible to the virus.  \\\\nOkay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q1 GAAP gross margins was 65.1% and non-GAAP was 65.8%, up sequentially and year-on-year, primarily driven by GeForce GPU product mix and higher data center sales. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $1.03 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $821 million, up 10% and 9% year-on-year, respectively. Q1 GAAP EPS was $1.47, up 130% from a year earlier, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.80, up 105% from a year ago. Q1 cash flow from operations was $909 million.  \\\\nBefore I turn to the outlook, let me make a few comments on our Mellanox acquisition. Beyond the strong strategic and cultural fit that Jensen has discussed, Mellanox has exceptionally strong financial profile. The company reported revenue of $429 million in its March quarter, accelerating to 40% year-on-year growth, with GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins in the mid- to high 60% range. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. We aim to retain the full Mellanox team and accelerate investments in our combined road map as we jointly innovate on our shared vision for the future of accelerated computing.  \\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which includes a full quarter contribution from Mellanox. We have assumed in our outlook the potential ongoing impact from COVID-19. We expect our automotive platform sales to be down 40% on a sequential basis and Pro Viz to decline sequentially. In gaming, while we will likely see ongoing impact from the partial operations or closures of iCafes and retail stores, we expect that to be largely offset by a shift to e-tail channels. Overall, the precise magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict, given uncertainties around the reopening of the economy. Overall, we expect second quarter revenue to be $3.65 billion, plus or minus 2%. The contribution of Mellanox revenue is likely to be in the low teens percentage range of our total Q2 revenue. We are providing this breakout to help with comparability between Q1 and Q2. But going forward, it will become an integrated part of our data center market platform.  \\\\nGAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The sequential decline in GAAP gross margins primarily reflects an increase in acquisition-related costs, most of which are nonrecurring.  \\\\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.52 billion, and $1.04 billion, respectively. The sequential change in GAAP operating expenses reflects an increase in stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. For the full year, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs also influence.  \\\\nGAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be an increase of approximately $50 million and $45 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $225 million to $250 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.  \\\\nNew this quarter, we have also posted an investor presentation summarizing our results and key highlights. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. Next Thursday, May 28, we will webcast a presentation and Q&A with Jensen on our recent product announcement moderated by Evercore. We will also be at Cowen\\'s TMT Conference on May 27; Morgan Stanley\\'s Cloud Secular Winners Conference on June 1; BoFa\\'s Technology Conference on June 2; Needham\\'s Fourth Automotive Technology Conference on June 3 and Nasdaq Investor Conference on June 16.  \\\\nOperator, we will now open for questions. Can you please poll for questions, please.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCongratulations on a solid quarter. Colette, I\\'m curious of your commentary around visibility in the data center side, that that\\'s comments over the last couple of quarters, how would you characterize your visibility today relative to maybe what it was last quarter? And how do we think about the visibility in the context of trends maybe into the back half of the calendar year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Will, for the question. You are correct. We have indicated a couple of quarters ago that we were starting to see improved visibility after we came out of the digestion period in the prior overall fiscal year. As we move into Q2, we still have visibility and solid visibility into our Q2 results for overall data centers. So at this time, I\\'d say they are relatively about the same of what we had seen going into the Q1 period. And we think that is a true indication of their excitement about our platform and most particularly our excitement regarding A100, and that\\'s launched and its additional products. \\\\nNow regarding the second half of the year, as you know, we have seen broad-based growth in both the hyperscale and the vertical industries, both of them in terms of at record levels. In our Q1 results. And we see in terms of inferencing continuing to grow as well, as well as we\\'re also expanding in terms of edge AI. Our strong demand of the A100 products, including the Delta Board, but also in terms of our DGXs, was just starting an initial ramp. However, we do guide only 1 quarter at a time. So it\\'s still a little bit too early for us to give a true certainty in terms of the macro situation that\\'s in front of us. But again, we feel very good about the demand for A100.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI first wanted to follow-up on your gaming commentary. You sort of mentioned a couple of offsets. COVID potentially still a headwind, e-tail or tailwind and maybe offsetting each other. Were you trying to suggest that those did offset completely and gaming was kind of flattish into Q2? Because I know it has a typical seasonal pattern switches typically up. I guess what were you trying to say with those kind of factors? And what are the kinds of things we should be thinking about when it comes to seasonality, Colette, into Q2 around that business segment?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo let me start, and I\\'ll see if Jensen also wants to add on to it. I think you\\'re talking about our sequential between Q1 and Q2. Some of the...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. That\\'s right.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRight. Some of the pieces that we had seen related to COVID-19 in Q1 may carry over into Q2. COVID-19, in fact, had an impact in terms of our retail channels as well as our iCafes. However, as we discussed, efficiently, moved to overall e-tail. We have normally been seasonally down in desktop between Q1 and Q2, and that will likely happen. But we do see the strength in terms of laptops and overall consoles as we move for Q1 to Q2. So in summary, we do expect grow sequentially between Q1 and Q2 for our overall gaming business. And I\\'ll turn it over to Jensen to see if he has additional commentary.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nNo, that was great. That was fantastic.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. I guess just to follow up on that, though, if it\\'s growing. I mean like in prior years, we\\'ve seen it grow like very strong double digits. Obviously, the mix of the business was different back then. But do you think that the kind of -- I mean are we thinking kind of it\\'s up somewhat? You don\\'t -- is there any chance that it could be up like on -- for what we\\'ve seen in terms of like typical levels in the past? Like can you give us any sense of magnitude, that would be really helpful?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. I think when we think about that sequential growth, we\\'ll probably be in the low -- moving up to probably the mid-single digits in terms of -- that\\'s what our guidance right now, and we\\'ll just have to see how the quarter goes.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. That\\'s very helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy, the thing that I would add is this. I would say, I think the guidance is exactly what Colette mentioned. But if you look at the big picture, there\\'s a few dynamics that are working really well in our favor. First, of course, is that RTX and ray tracing is just the home run. Minecraft was phenomenal. We have 33 games in the pipe that has already been announced or shipping. Just about every game developers signed on to RTX and ray tracing, and I think it\\'s a foregone conclusion that this is the next generation. This is the way computer graphics is going to be in the future. And so I think RTX is a home run. \\\\nThe second, the notebooks that we create is just doing great. We got 100 notebooks in gaming. We have 75 notebooks designed for either mobile workstations or what we call NVIDIA studio for designers and creators. And the timing was just perfect. With everybody needing to stay at home, the ability to have a mobile gaming platform and a mobile workstation, it was just perfect timing. And then, of course, you guys know quite well that our Nintendo Switch is doing fantastic. There are 3 -- the top 3 games in the world. The top games in the world today are Fortnite, Minecraft and Animal Crossing. All 3 games are NVIDIA platforms. And so I think we have all the dynamics working in our favor. And then we just got to see how it turns out.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI wanted to ask about the rollout of Ampere how quickly does that roll in the various segments between hyperscale as well as on the DGX side as well as on the HPC side. And is it a smooth transition? Is there -- I remember when you launched Volta, there was a little bit of a transitional pause. Just can you tell us how you see that ramping up with the different customer segments?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Thanks a lot, Joe. So first of all, taking a step back. Accelerated computing is now common sense in data centers. It wasn\\'t the case when we first launched Volta. If you went back to Volta, Volta was the first generation that the deep learning training in a really serious way, and it was really focused on training. It was focused on training and high-performance computing. We didn\\'t come until later with the inference version called T4. \\\\nBut over the course of the last 5 years, we\\'ve been accelerating workloads that are now diversifying in data centers. If you take a look at most of the hyperscalers, machine learning is now pervasive. Deep learning is now pervasive. The notion of accelerated deep learning and machine learning using our GPUs is now common sense. It didn\\'t used to be. People still saw it as something esoteric. But today, data centers all over the world expect a very significant part of their data center being accelerated with GPUs. The number of workloads that we\\'ve accelerated since in the last 5 years have expanded tremendously, whether it\\'s imaging or video or conversational AI or deep recommender systems that probably unquestionably, at this point, the most important machine learning model in the world. And so the number of applications we now accelerate is quite diverse. And so that\\'s really -- that\\'s contributed greatly to the ramp of Ampere. When we came -- when we started to introduce Ampere to the data center, it was very commonsensical to them that they would adopt it. They have a large amount of workload that\\'s already accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs. \\\\nAnd as you know, our GPUs are architecturally compatible from generation to generation. We\\'re forward compatible or backwards compatible. Everything that runs on T4 runs on A100, everything that runs on V100 runs on A100. And so I think the transition is going to be really, really smooth. On the other hand, because V100 and T4 -- which, by the way, V100 and T4 had a great quarter. It was sequentially up. And then on top of that, we grew with the A100 shipment. A100 -- or excuse me, V100 and T4 are now quite broadly adopted in hyperscalers for their AI services, in cloud computing, in a vertical industries, which is almost roughly half of our overall HPC business. All the way out to the edge, which had a great quarter. Much smaller part, of course -- supercomputing is important, but it\\'s a very small part of the high-performance computing. But that\\'s also -- we also shipped A100 to supercomputing centers. And so I think the general sense of it -- the summary of it is that the number of workloads for accelerated computing has continued to grow, the adoption of machine learning and AI and all the cloud and hyperscalers has grown. The common sense of using acceleration is now a foregone conclusion. And so I think we\\'re ramping into a very receptive market with a really fantastic -- with a really fantastic product.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCongratulations on the strong growth and execution. Just a quick clarification. Colette, 66% kind of the new baseline for gross margin? And then the question, Jensen, for you, is give us a sense for how much inference as a workload and payer as a product are expected to contribute? I\\'m just curious where you are in terms of growing in the inference and edge AI market? And where are we kind of in the journey of Ampere penetration?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo let me start on the first question regarding the gross margin and our gross margin as we look into Q2. We are guiding Q2 non-GAAP gross margins at 66%. This is -- would be another record gross margin quarter just as we finished an overall record level, even as we are continuing right now to ramp our overall Ampere architecture within that. The Q2 also incorporates Mellanox. Mellanox has a very similar overall margins to our overall data center margins as well. But we see this new baseline as a great transition and likely to see some changes as we go forward. However, it\\'s still a little early to see where these gross margins will go. But we\\'re very pleased with the overall guidance right now at 66% for Q2.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAccelerated computing is just at the beginning of its journey. If you look at -- I would characterize it as several segments. First is hyperscaler AI microservices, which is all the services that we enjoy today that has AI. Whenever you shop on the web, it recommends a product. When you\\'re watching a movie, it recommends a movie or it recommends a song. All of those -- or recommends news or recommends a friend or recommends a website, the first 10 websites that they recommend. All of these recommenders that are powering the Internet are all based on machine learning today. It\\'s the reason why they\\'re collecting so much data. The more data they can collect, the more they could predict your preference, and that predicting your preference is the core to a personalized Internet. It used to be largely based on CPU approaches. But going forward, it\\'s all based on deep learning approaches. The results are much more superior and a few percentage change in preference prediction accuracy could result in tens of billions of dollars of economics. \\\\nAnd so this is very, very big deal. And the shift towards deep learning in hyperscale micro services or AI micro services is still ramping. Second is cloud. And as you know, cloud is a $100 billion market segment of it today, growing about 40% into $1 trillion opportunity. This -- cloud computing is the single largest IT industry transformation that we have ever seen. The 2 powers that is really -- the force -- the 2 forces that is really driving our data center business is AI and cloud computing. We\\'re perfectly, perfectly positioned to benefit from these 2 powerful forces. So the second is cloud computing. And that journey is -- has a long ways to go. Then the third is industrial edge. In the future, today -- it\\'s not the case today. But the combination of IoT, 5G, industrial 5G and artificial intelligence, it\\'s going to turn every single industry into a tech industry. And whether it\\'s logistics or warehousing or manufacturing or farming, construction, industrial, every single industry will become a tech industry. And there\\'ll be trillions of sensors, and they\\'ll be connected to little micro data centers. \\\\nAnd those data centers will be in the millions. They\\'ll be distributed all over the edge. And that journey has just barely started. We announced 3 very important partners in 3 domains. And they\\'re the lead partners that we felt that people would know, but we have several hundred partners that are working with us on edge AI. We announced Walmart for smart retail. We announced the U.S. Postal Service, the world\\'s largest mail sorting service and logistics service. And then we announced this last quarter, BMW, who is working with us to transform their factory into a robotics, automated factory of the future. And so these 3 applications are great examples of the next phase of artificial intelligence and where Ampere is going to ramp into. And that is just really at its early stages. And so I think it\\'s fair to say that we\\'re really well positioned in the 2 fundamental forces of IT today, data center scale computing and artificial intelligence. And the segments that it\\'s going to make a real impact are all gigantic markets. Hyperscale AI, cloud and edge AI.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI guess if I could ask 2. Colette, can you help us with what you think the growth rate for Mellanox could look like in calendar \\'20? And then Jensen, a bigger picture question for you and really not specific to health care, more broad-based. But how do you think about the long-lasting impact of COVID on worldwide demand for AI?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nC.J., can you help me? You cut out in the middle of your sentence to me. Can you repeat the first part of it for me?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nNo, sorry about that. I\\'m curious if you could provide a little handholding on what we should think about for growth for Mellanox in calendar \\'20?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAt this time, it\\'s a little early for us. And as you know, we generally just go 1 quarter out, and we\\'re excited to bring the Mellanox team on board so we can start beginning the future of building products together. For the overall margin, their overall performance over the last couple of quarters, they had a great last year. They had a great March quarter as well. And we\\'re just going to have to stay tuned to see equally with them what the second half of the year looks for them. Okay?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, C.J., thanks for the question. This pandemic is really quite tragic, and it\\'s reshaping industries and markets. And I think it\\'s going to be structural. I think it\\'s going to remain. And I think your question is really good because now it\\'s a good time to think about where to double down. There\\'s a few areas that I believe are going to be structurally changed. And I think that once I say it, it\\'ll be very sensible. The first is that the world\\'s enterprise digital transformation and moving to the cloud, that is going to accelerate. Every single company can\\'t afford to rely just on on-prem IT. They have to be much more resilient. And having a hybrid cloud computing infrastructure is  going to provide them the resilience they need. And so that\\'s one. And when the world moves and accelerates into this $1 trillion IT infrastructure transformation, which is now $100 billion into that journey, it\\'s growing 40% a year, I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see that accelerate. And so cloud computing AI is going to accelerate because of that. The second is the importance of creating a computational defense system. The defense systems of most nations today are based on radar. And yet in the future, our defense systems are going to detect things that are unseeable. It\\'s going to be infectious disease. \\\\nAnd I think every nation and government and scientific lab is now gearing up to think about what does it take to create a national defense system for each country that is based on computational methods? And NVIDIA is an accelerated computing company. We take something that otherwise would take a year in the case of Oak Ridge, and they filter 1 billion compounds in a day. And that\\'s what you need to do. You need to find a way to have an accelerated computational defense system that allows you to find insight, detect early warning ASAP. And then, of course, the computational system has to go through the entire range from mitigation to containment to living within the monitoring. And so scientific labs are going to be gearing up. National labs are going to be gearing up. The third part is AI and robotics. We\\'re going to have to have the ability to be able to do our work remotely. \\\\nNVIDIA has a lot of robots that are helping us in our labs. And without those robots helping us in our labs, we\\'ll have a hard time getting our work done. And so we need to have remote autonomous capability for -- to handle all of these -- either dangerous circumstances to disinfect environments, to fumigate environments autonomously, to clean environments, to be able to interact with people where as little as possible in the event of an outbreak. All kinds of robotics applications are being dreamed up right now to help society forward in the case of another outbreak. And then lastly, I think more and more people are going to work permanently from home. There\\'s a strong movement of companies that are going to support a larger percentage of people working from home. And when people work from home, it\\'s going to clearly increase the single best home entertainment, which is video games. I think video games is going to represent a much larger segment of the overall entertainment budget of society. \\\\nAnd so these are some of the trends, I would say. I would say cloud computing, AI. I would say national labs, a computational defense system, robotics and working from home are structural changes that are going to be here to stay. And these dynamics are really good for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI had one for Colette and then one for Jensen as well, if I may. Colette, I wanted to come back to the gross margin question. You\\'re guiding July essentially flat sequentially, despite what I\\'m guessing is better mixed with non-ops coming in and automotive guided down 40% sequentially. I guess the question is, what are some of the offsets that are pulling down gross margins in the current quarter? And sort of related to that, how should we be thinking about the cadence and OpEx going forward, given the 6-month pull in that you guys talked about on the compensation side? And then one quick one for Jensen. I was hoping you could comment on the current trade landscape between the U.S. and China. I feel like you guys shouldn\\'t be impacted in a material way directly nor indirectly. But at the same time, given the critical role you play in scientific computing, I can sort of see a scenario where some people may claim that you guys contribute to efforts outside of the U.S. So if you can kind of speak on that -- speak to that, that will be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Toshiya, for your question. So regarding our gross margins in the second quarter, our second quarter guide at 66% is up sequentially from even a record level in terms of what we had in terms of Q1. This next record that we hope to achieve with our overall guidance is even with including our overall Ampere architecture. So typically, when we transition to a new architectures, margins can somewhat be a little bit lower on the onset but tend to kind of move up and trend up over time. Additionally, as you articulated, our automotive is lower. But also, we\\'re going to see growth in some of our platforms in gaming such as consoles, which may offset those 2. But overall, there\\'s nothing structural to really highlight other than our mix in business and the ramp of Ampere and its transition.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLet\\'s see, the trade tension. We\\'ve been living in this environment for some time, Toshiya. And as you know, the trade tension has been in the background for coming up on a year, probably gotten longer. And China\\'s high-performance computing systems are largely based on Chinese electronics anyhow. And so that\\'s -- I think our condition won\\'t materially change going forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo Toshiya, let me respond to your second question that you had for me, which was regarding to our OpEx and our decision to pull forward our overall local into Q2. This is something that we\\'ve normally done later in the year. We felt it was prudent during the current COVID-19. Although our employees are quite safe. We just wanted to make sure that their family members also were safe and had the opportunity to have cash upfront. It is about a couple of months, about 4 months earlier than normal, and it is incorporated in our guidance for Q2.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nA question coming back to the A100. I\\'m trying to understand how this kind of fits into the evolution of your solution set over time and the evolution of the demand for the applications. Is -- and I guess if I think about it going back, you had a solution, which is largely training based. And then you kind of introduced solutions that were targeted more inferencing. And now you have a solution, it sounds to my understanding that it solves both inferencing and training efficiently. And so I guess I\\'m wondering is 3 years, 5 years, 10 years down the line, is this part of the kind of general purpose computing or acceleration framework that you had talked about in the past, Jensen, where Ampere is kind of like an Ampere-class product? Or is this -- would you still -- should we still expect to see inferencing-specific solutions in the market and then training-specific solutions and then an Ampere solution for a different class application? If you could provide a framework for thinking about Ampere in those context, I think that would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Thanks for the call, Mark. Good Question. I think the -- if you take a step back, currently in our data centers, the current setup in data centers, starting from probably all the way back, 6, 7 years ago, but really accelerating in the last 5 years and then really accelerating in the last couple of years, we learned our way into it. There are 3 classes of workloads, and they kind of came into acceleration over time. The first class of workload that we discovered was -- the major workload was deep learning training. Deep learning training. And the ideal setup for that today prior to Ampere or yesterday prior to Ampere is the V100 SXM with NVLink, 8 GPUs on one board, and that architecture is called scale up. It\\'s like a supercomputer architecture. It\\'s like a -- it\\'s like a weather simulation architecture. You\\'re trying to build the largest possible computing node you can for one operating system called scale up. And the second thing that we learned along the way was then cloud computing started to grow because researchers around the world needed to get access to an accelerated platform for developing their machine learning algorithms. And because they have a different degree of budget, and they want to get into it, a little bit more lightly and have the ability to scale up to larger nodes, the perfect model for that was actually a V100 PCI Express, not SXM, but PCI Express that allows you to offer 1 GPU all the way up to many GPUs. \\\\nAnd so that versatility, V100 PCI Express, not as scalable in performance as the V100 SXMs, but it was much more flexible for rentals. Cloud renting was really quite ideal. And then we started to get into inference, and we\\'re on our seventh generation of TensorRT, TensorRT 7.0. Along the way, we\\'ve been able to accelerate more and more. And today, we largely accelerate every deep learning inference computational graph that\\'s out there. And the ideal GPU for that was something that has the reduced precision, which is called (inaudible), reduced precision not with electronics that is focused more for inference -- and because inference is a scale-out application, where you have millions of queries, and each one of the queries are quite small versus scale up, where you have 1 training job and that 1 training job is running for a day. \\\\nIt could be running for days and sometimes even weeks. And so scale-up application is for 1 user that uses it for a long period of time on a very large machine. Scale out, it\\'s for millions of users, each one of them have a very small query and that query could last hundreds of milliseconds and where ideally, you like to get it done in hundreds of milliseconds. And so notice, I\\'ve said 3 different architecture in a data center today. Most data centers today has a storage server, has CPU servers, and it has scale-up acceleration service with Voltas has scaled out servers with GeForce and then it has scale cloud computing, flexible servers based on V100. And so the ability to predict workload is so hard, and therefore, the utilization of these systems will be spiky. And so we created an architecture that allows for 3 things. \\\\nSo things -- the 3 characteristics of Ampere are: number one, it is the greatest generational leap in history. I mean I don\\'t remember a generation where we increased throughput for training and inference by 20x. And it\\'s just a gigantic -- for training and for inference, it is a gigantic leap forward. The second, it\\'s the first architecture that is unified. We could use this to the computational -- the computation engine of Ampere accelerates the moment the data comes into the data center. From data processing, it\\'s called [ETO]; the engine, which many of you probably know, it\\'s the single most important computational engine in the world today for big data. It used to be Hadoop, but now it\\'s Spark. Spark is used all over the world, 16,000 customers. We finally have the ability to accelerate that. \\\\nAnd then it\\'s -- Ampere is also good for training, deep learning, machine learning, extra boost as well as deep learning, all the way out to inference. And so we now have a unified acceleration platform for the entire workload. And then the third thing is it\\'s the first GPU ever, the first acceleration platform ever that\\'s elastic. You could reconfigure it. You could configure it for either scale up or you can configure it for scale out. When you configure it for scale up, you\\'re gaining a whole bunch of GPUs together using NVLink, and it creates this 1 gigantic GPU. When you want to scale it out, that same computation node becomes 56 small GPUs. Each one of those 56 partitions, each 1 is more powerful than Volta. \\\\nI mean it\\'s really quite extraordinary. And so Ampere is a breakthrough on all of these fronts for performance for the fact that it unifies the workload, and you can now have 1 acceleration cluster; and then number three, it\\'s elastic. You could use in the cloud, you could use for inference, you could use it for training. And so the versatility of Ampere is the thing that I\\'m most excited about. And now you could have 1 acceleration cluster that serves all of your needs. That\\'s very helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nActually I had 2, I guess, Jensen, first for you. Just on the data center business, things have been very strong recently. Obviously, there\\'s always concerns that customers are pulling in CapEx, but it sounds like you have pretty good visibility into July. But I guess last time, most folks also thought that your kind of attrition really was so low that you would be immune into any digestion, but that wasn\\'t the case. So I guess I\\'m wondering, if things are different now with A100 and whatnot, but my question is how do you handicap your ability to this time, maybe get through any digestion on the CapEx side? And then I guess, second question, Colette, stock comp had been running like 220 a quarter, and the guidance implies that it goes to like 460 a quarter. So it goes up a lot. Is that all executive retention? And is that sort of the right level as you look into 2021?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette, did you want to handle that first? And then I\\'ll do the...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. So let me help you out on the overall GAAP adjustments, so the delta between our GAAP OpEx and our non-GAAP OpEx. If you look at it for the full year and what we guided, we probably have about $1.55 billion associated with GAAP level expenses. Keep in mind, there is more in there than just our stock-based compensation. We have also incorporated the accounting that we will do for the overall Mellanox, and a really good portion of those costs are associated with the amortization of intangibles and also in terms of acquisition-related costs and deal fees and onetime items. So our stock-based compensation includes what we need for NVIDIA and also the onboarding of Mellanox. There is some retention with the overall onboarding of Mellanox. But for the most part, it is just working them in to the year for 3 quarters, which is influencing the stock-based compensation.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTim, there are several differences between our condition then and our condition today. So the first -- the first difference is the diversity of workload we now accelerate. Back then, we were early in our inference. We were still early in our inference, and most of the data center acceleration was used for deep learning. And so today, the versatility stands from data processing to deep learning and the number of -- the number of different types of AI models that\\'s being trained for deep learning is growing tremendously from detecting, from training video, from training a model to detecting unsafe video. The natural language understanding the conversational AI to now a gigantic movement towards deep recommender systems. And so the number of different models that are being trained is growing. The size of the models are gigantic. Recommendation systems are gigantic. They\\'re training on models that are hundreds. The data sizes, hundreds of terabytes. Terabytes, hundreds of terabytes. And it would take tens of -- hundreds of servers to hold all of the data that is needed to train these recommender systems. And so the diversity of -- from data analytics to training all the different models to the influence of all different models. We didn\\'t inference recurring elements at a time, which is probably the most important model today. Text language models, speech models are all recurrent, Euronet models. And so those models were early for us at the time. So number one is the diversity of workload. The second is the acceleration of -- to cloud computing. I think that accelerated cloud computing is a movement that is going to be a multiyear if not a decade-long transition. From where we are today, it\\'s only $100 billion industry segment of the IT industry. It\\'s going to be $1 trillion someday, and that movement is just starting. We\\'re also much more diversified out of the clouds. At the time, cloud was largely where our acceleration went for deep learning. And today, hyperscale only represents about half. And so we\\'ve diversified significantly out of cloud, not out of cloud, but including vertical industries. And a lot of that has to do with edge AI and inference. And as I mentioned earlier, we\\'re working with Walmart and BMW and USPS, and that\\'s just the tip of the iceberg. And so I think the conditions are a little different. And then what I would say lastly is Ampere. I mean we are -- we\\'ve ramped a few weeks. Even though it was quite significant, it was a great ramp. The demand is fantastic. It is the best ramp we\\'ve ever had. The demand is the strongest we\\'ve ever had in data centers. And we\\'re starting to ramp of a multiyear ramp. And so -- those are some of the differences. I think the conditions are very different.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen, the team has showed the importance of networking, networking fabric and the Mellanox acquisition, like, for example, when you guys move from Volta DGX-1 to Volta DGX-2, you guys didn\\'t change the GPU chipset. But by adding a custom networking fabric chip and more Mellanox network interface cards, among other things, you guys drove a pretty significant improvement in performance per GPU. But now when we think about scaling out compute acceleration to data center skilled implementation, how does Mellanox\\' Ethernet switching platforms differ from those provided by other large networking OEMs, some of whom have been your long-term partners? And then how does the Cumulus acquisition fit into the switching and networking strategy as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Great. Thanks a lot, Harlan. I appreciate the question. So DGX, you know this is our third-generation DGX and it\\'s really successful. People love it. It\\'s the most advanced AI instrument in the world. If you\\'re a serious AI researcher, this is your instrument. And in the DGX, there are 8 A100s and there are 9 Mellanox NICs, the highest speed NICs they have. And so we have a great appreciation for high-performance networking. High-performance networking and high-performance computing go hand-in-hand. And the reason for that is because the problems we\\'re trying to solve no longer fit in one computer, no matter how big it is. And so it has to be distributed. And when you distribute a computational workload of such intense scale, the communications overhead becomes one of its greatest bottlenecks, which is the reason why Mellanox is so valuable. There\\'s reason why this company is so precious and really a jewel and one of a kind. And so -- and it\\'s not just about the link speed. It\\'s not mostly. \\\\nI mean we just have a deep appreciation for software. It\\'s a combination of architecture and software and electronics design, chip design. And in that combination, Mellanox is just world-class. And that\\'s the reason why they\\'re in 60% of the world\\'s supercomputers. That\\'s why they\\'re in 100% of the AI supercomputers. And their understanding of large-scale distributed computing is second to none. Now in the world of -- and I just talked about scale up. And you\\'re absolutely right. \\\\nNow the question is why scale out? And the reason for that is this. This is the reason why they\\'re doing so well. The movement towards disaggregated microservice applications where containers, microservice containers are distributed all over the data center and orchestrated so that the workload could be distributed across a very large hyperscale data center. That architecture -- and you probably know the 3 most important application in my estimation in the world today, number one, would be TensorFlow and PyTorch; number two would be Spark; and number three would be Kubernetes. And you could rank it however you desire. \\\\nAnd these 3 applications, in the case of Kubernetes, it\\'s a brand-new type of application where the application is broken up with a small pieces and orchestrated across an entire data center. And because it\\'s broken up into small pieces and orchestrate across the entire data center, the networking between the compute nodes becomes the bottleneck again. And that\\'s the reason why they\\'re doing so well. By increasing the network performance by offloading the communications of the CPUs, you increase the throughput of a data center tremendously. And so it\\'s the reason why they had a record quarter last quarter. It\\'s the reason why they\\'ve been growing 27% per year. And their stock was back, their integration into the hyperscale cloud companies, they\\'re low latency, they\\'re incredibly low latency of their link makes them really unique, even whether it\\'s Ethernet or InfiniBand in both cases. \\\\nAnd so they\\'re -- it\\'s a really fantastic stack. And then lastly, Cumulus, we would like to integrate -- we would like to innovate in this world where the world is moving away from just a CPU as a compute node. The new computing unit, a software developer is writing a piece of software that runs on the entire data center. In the future, going forward, the computing, the fundamental computing unit is an entire data center. It\\'s so incredible. It\\'s just utterly incredible. You write an application, 1 human could write an application, and it would literally activate an entire data center. And in that world, we would like to be able to innovate from end to end, from networking storage, security. Everything has to be secured in the future so that we can reduce the attack surface down to practically nothing. \\\\nAnd so networking storage, security are all completely offloaded, all incredibly low latency, all incredibly high performance and all the way to compute, all the way through the switch. And then the second thing is we\\'d like to be able to innovate across the entire stack. You know that NVIDIA is just supremely obsessed about software stacks. And the reason for that is because software creates markets. You can\\'t create new markets like we\\'re talking about, whether it\\'s computational health care or autonomous driving or robotic or conversational AI or recommender systems or edge AI. All of that requires software stacks. It takes software to create markets. And so our obsession about software and creating open platforms for the ecosystem and all of our developer partners, Cumulus plays perfectly into that. They are -- they pioneered the open networking stack. And they pioneered, in a lot of ways, software-defined data centers. And so we\\'re super, super excited about the team. And now we have the ability to innovate in a data center scale world from end to end and then from top to bottom of the entire stack.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWilliam Stein,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen, I\\'d like to focus on something you said. I think it was in one of your earlier responses, you said something about a very significant part of data centers are now accelerated with GPUs. I\\'m sort of curious how to interpret that. If we think about sort of the evolution of compute architecture going from almost entirely, let\\'s say, [REX and REXs] CPUs to some future day where we have many more accelerators and maybe a much smaller number of CPUs relative to those. Maybe you can talk to us about where we are in terms of that architectural shift and where you think it goes sort of longer term, where we are in the position of that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. I appreciate the question. And this, for computer architecture geeks and people who follow history, you know well that in the entire history of time, there are only 2 computing architectures that has made it so far, which is one of them is x86. The other one\\'s ARM in any reasonable way. And if you get an ARM computer, you get an x86 computer, you can program it. And  in fact, there\\'s no such thing as an accelerated computing platform until we came along. \\\\nAnd today, we\\'re the only computing -- accelerated computing platform that you could really largely address. We\\'re in every cloud. We\\'re in every computer company. We\\'re in every country. We have every single size, and we accelerate applications from computer graphics to video games to scientific computing to workstations to machine learning to robotics. This journey took 20-some-odd years. Inside our company, it took 20-some-odd years. And we\\'ve been focused on accelerated computing since the beginning of our company. And we made a general purpose. We made a general purpose really starting with an endeavor cost Cg, C for graphics, and then it became CUDA. And we\\'ve been working on accelerated computing for quite a long time. \\\\nAnd I think at this point, it\\'s a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing has reached the tipping point and is well beyond it. The number of developers this year that support -- that we supported was almost 2 million developers around the world, and it\\'s growing what appears to be exponentially. And so I think accelerated computing is now well established. NVIDIA-accelerated computing is well established. It\\'s common sense, and people who are designing data centers expect to put accelerated computing in it. The question is how much? How much accelerated computing do you use? And what part of the date in your pipeline do you do it? And the big -- the gigantic breakthrough, of course, we know well now, and NVIDIA is recognized as one of the 3 pillars that ignited the modern AI, the big bang of modern AI. \\\\nAnd the other 2 pillar, of course, is deep learning algorithm and the abundance of data. And so the 3 -- these 3 ingredients came together and was -- people use NVIDIA accelerated computing largely for training. But over time, we expanded training to have a lot more models. And as I mentioned earlier, the single most important model of machine learning today is the recommender system. It\\'s the most important model because it\\'s the only way that you and I could use the Internet in any reasonable way. It\\'s the only way that you and I could use a shopping website or a video web -- a video app or a music app or book or news or anything. And so it is the engine of the Internet from the consumer\\'s perspective. On the company perspective, it is the engine of commerce. Without the recommender system, there\\'s no way they could possibly make money. \\\\nAnd so their accuracy in predicting user preferences is core to everything they do. You just go up and down the list of every company. And that engine is gigantic. It is just a gigantic engine. And from the data processing part of it, which is the reason why we went and spent 3 years on Spark and RAPIDS, which made Spark possible and all the work that we did on NVLink and all that stuff was really focused on big data analytics. The second is all of the training of the deep learning models and the inference. So the number of applications, the footprint, the accelerated computing has grown tremendously, and its importance has grown tremendously because of the applications are the most important applications of these companies. And so I think when I mentioned -- when I said that, that acceleration is still growing, it is. But the major workloads, the most important workloads of the world\\'s most important companies are now -- solidly require acceleration. And so I\\'m looking forward to a really exciting ramp for Ampere for all the reasons that I just mentioned.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJust 2 quick ones. Colette, I hate to ask something as mundane as OpEx, but just given the full year guide, there\\'s sort of a lot to unpack. And you talked about some of it like the raises. I mean I think you also probably have some COVID plus or minuses in that. I think there\\'s an extra week this year as well. And then, of course, there\\'s Mellanox and how you\\'re thinking about investing in that asset. \\\\nI guess I\\'m just kind of curious, when we look at the full year guide, is there something structural going on OpEx as you try to take advantage of all these opportunities? Or can we use it as sort of a guidepost to how you\\'re thinking about revenue for the back half of the year as well? How do I understand that? And then, Jensen, just a quick one for you. It kind of makes sense to me that COVID is accelerating activity in sort of HPC and hyperscale and maybe even in certain verticals like health care. But in the other verticals, has the sort of shelter in place kind of hurt engagement? And could we actually come out of COVID with some pent-up demand in those vertical markets?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thanks, John, for the question. Let\\'s start from the first perspective on the overall OpEx for the year. We\\'ve guided the non-GAAP at approximately $4.1 billion for the year. Yes, that incorporates 3 full quarters of Mellanox, Mellanox and its employees. We have about close to 3,000 Mellanox employees coming on board. You are correct. We have a 53rd week in this quarter -- excuse me, not this quarter, this year. \\\\nAnd that is -- has been outlined in SEC filings, and you should expect that as well. We pulled forward a little bit our focal by several months in order to take care of our employees. And then lastly though, we are investing in our business. We see some great opportunities. You\\'ve seen some good results from our investment, and there\\'s more to do. We are hiring and investing in those businesses. So there\\'s nothing different structurally, but just this onset of Mellanox and are investing together, I think, we\\'ll produce long-term great results.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd as usual, John, you know that we\\'re investing into the IT industry\\'s largest opportunities, cloud computing and AI. And then after these 2 opportunities is edge AI. And so we\\'re looking down the fairway with some pretty extraordinary opportunities. But as usual, we\\'re thoughtful about the rate of investment, and we\\'re well-managed. And NVIDIA\\'s leadership team are excellent managers, and you could count on us to continue to do that. Simona, what was John\\'s question? Could you just give me one hint? I haven\\'t...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJust the idea of engagement levels in verticals, just with shelter in place. Has that hampered...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOh yes. Right. Yes, right. Yes, right. A few -- some of the industries have been affected. We already mentioned automotive industry. The automotive industry has been grounded to a halt. Manufacturing hasn\\'t largely stopped. And you saw that in our guidance. We expect automotive to be down 40% quarter-to-quarter. It\\'s not going to remain that way. It\\'s going to come back. And nobody knows what level is going to come back to you and how long, but it\\'s going to come back. And there\\'s no question in my mind that the automotive industry, they\\'re hunkered down right now, but they will absolutely invest in the future of autonomous vehicles. \\\\nThey have to, or they\\'ll be extinct. It\\'s not possible not to have autonomous capability in the future of everything that moves. Not so that it could just completely drive without you. That a nice benefit, too. But mostly because of safety and comfort and just a joy of what seems like the car is reading your mind. And of course, you\\'re still responsible for driving it and -- but it just seems to be coasting down the road, reading your mind and helping you. And so I think the future of autonomous vehicles is a certainty. People recognize the incredible economics that the pioneer, Tesla, is enjoying. And the industry is going to go after it. \\\\nThe future car companies are going to be software-defined companies and technology companies. And they would love to have an economic that allows them to enjoy the installed base of their fleets. And so they\\'re going to go after it. And so this is -- I\\'m certain that this is going to come back. And well, I have every confidence is going to come back. And let\\'s see, the energy sectors are -- have been impacted. The retail sector has been impacted. There\\'s -- those aren\\'t large industries for us. The impact in some of the industries is accelerating their focus in robotics. Like, for example, on the one hand, BMW has obviously impacted in manufacturing, which is the reason why they\\'re moving so rapidly towards robotics. They have to figure out a way to get robotics into their factories. So same thing with retail. You\\'re going to see a lot more robotic support in retail, you\\'re going to see a lot more robotic support in warehouses, in logistics. And so during this time, when the market -- when the industry is disrupted and impacted, it allows the market leaders to really lean into investing into the future. And so when they come back, they\\'ll be coming back stronger than ever.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd your next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTwo different topics, Jensen. Well, first of all, congrats on Ampere. It\\'s a heck of a product. The first question...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Matt. I\\'m so proud.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThe first question is it might have been a little bit hard to talk when the deal was pending about this topic, but now that it\\'s closed, maybe you could talk a little bit about opportunities to innovate on and customize the Mellanox stack and the balance of having an industry standard. And the second one is E3 canceled, Computex moved around. At the same time, there\\'s obviously stay-at-home gaming demand. Just how you think about gaming product, launch logistics? And any comments on there would be really helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Thanks a lot, Matt. I appreciate your questions. I\\'ll go backwards because it\\'s kind of cool. On the one hand, I do miss that we can\\'t engage the developers face to face. It\\'s just so much fun. GTC is doing all their work and the hundreds of papers that are presented, I learned so much each time. And frankly, I really enjoyed the analyst meeting that we have. And so there\\'s all kinds of stuff that I missed about the physical GTC, but here\\'s the amazing thing. \\\\nWe had almost -- the GTC kitchen keynote. I did it from my kitchen just right behind me, and the kitchen keynote has been viewed almost 4 million times. And the video is incredible. And so I think our reach is -- could be quite great. And so I\\'m not too -- we\\'ve got an amazing marketing team, and we just -- we\\'ve got great people. They\\'re going to find a way to reach our gamers. And whenever we launch something next, you know that gamers are going to be and our customers are going to be -- our end markets are going to be really excited to see it. And so I\\'m very confident that we\\'re going to do just fine. Matt, what was the question before? I should never do backwards.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJust the industry standard versus customization of Mellanox opportunity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI see. Okay. Yes. There\\'s -- we work so closely with Mellanox over the years. And on the day that we announced GTC, you could see the number of products that we have working together. The product synergies are really incredible, and the product synergies include a lot of software development that went in and a lot of architectural development that went in. DGX comes with 9 Mellanox, Matt, as I mentioned. If you look at our data center, we ship -- before we ship DGXs to the customers, we ship it to our own engineers. And the reason for that is because every single product in our company has AI in it. \\\\nFrom Jarvis to Metropolis to Merlin to DRIVE to Clara to Isaac to -- right? All of our products has AI in it, and we\\'re accelerating frameworks for all of the AI industry. And Ampere comes with a brand-new numerical format called Tensor Float 32. And TF32 is just a fantastic [medium medical] format and the performance is incredible. And we had to get it integrated in with the industry standard frameworks. And now Tensor Float comes standard with Tensor Flow -- with TF -- NVIDIA TF32, and PyTorch come standard with TF32. And so we need our own large-scale data center. And so the first customer we ship to was ourselves. And then we started shipping as quickly as we could to all of the customers. You saw that in our data center, in our supercomputer. \\\\nWe have 170 -- 170 state-of-the-art, brand-new Mellanox switches. And almost 1,500 -- 200 gigabit per second Mellanox mix. And 15 kilometers of cables, fiber optic cables. And that is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world today, and it\\'s based on Ampere. And so we have a great deal of work that we did there together. We announced our first edge computer between us and Mellanox in this new card, we call it the EGX A100. It integrates Ampere and it integrates Mellanox\\' CX-6 Dx, which is designed for 5G telcos and edge computing. It\\'s incredible security and has a single route of trust, and it\\'s virtualized. And so basically, we -- this EGX A100, when you put it into a standard center x86 server, turns that server into a cloud computer in a box. \\\\nThe entire capability of a cloud, of a state-of-the-art cloud, which is cloud native, it\\'s secure, it has incredible AI processing, it\\'s now completely hyperconverged inside 1 box. The technology that made EGX A100 is really quite remarkable. And so you could see all the different product synergies that we have in working together. We could have done Spark acceleration without the collaboration with Mellanox. They worked on this piece of networking software called UCX. We worked on [nickel] together. It made possible the infrastructure for large-scale distributor computing. I mean just the list goes on and on and on. And so we -- the 2 teams have great chemistry. The culture -- it\\'s a great culture fit. I love working with them. And right out of the chute, you saw all of the great product synergies that are made possible because of the combination.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat is all the time we have for questions. I\\'ll turn the call back to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIt\\'s coming. Let me just -- thank you. We had a great and busy quarter. With our announcements, we highlighted several initiatives. First, computing is moving to data center scale where computing and networking go hand in hand. The acquisition of Mellanox gives us deep expertise and scale to innovate from end to end. Second, AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. Our Ampere generation offers several breakthroughs. It is the largest ever generational leap 20x in training and inference throughput; the first unified acceleration platform for data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, training and inference; and the first elastic accelerator that can be configured for scale-up applications like training to scale-out applications like inference. \\\\nAmpere is fast, it\\'s universal and it\\'s elastic. It\\'s going to re-architect the modern data center. Third, we are opening large new markets with AI software application framework, such as Clara for health care, DRIVE for autonomous vehicles, Isaac for robotics, Jarvis for conversational AI, Metropolis for edge IoT, AERIAL for 5G and Merlin with the very important recommender systems. And then finally, we have built up multiple engines of accelerated computing growth. RTX computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and data center scale computing from cloud to edge. I look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks, everybody.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis concludes today\\'s conference call.

Lisa? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our strong third-quarter results highlight the progress we have made across AMD this past year, as we improved our financial performance by delivering great products. Third-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion increased 27% sequentially and 23% from the year-ago period, driven by upside demand for our graphics products, and record semi custom sales. \\\\nIn addition to the significant revenue growth, we also achieved several financial and operational milestones in the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet and improved our P&L through a series of capital markets transactions that reprofiled and reduced our debt. We also signed a strategic amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES that provides sourcing flexibility and financial predictability. Most importantly, we delivered non-GAAP net income in the quarter, based on strong execution of our product road map, and growing momentum across our business. \\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we had solid growth in the quarter. Revenue increased 9% sequentially, and 11% from the year-ago period, driven by improved sales of mobile APUs and discrete GPUs. Mobile processor revenue and unit shipments increased for the fourth straight quarter, as 7th-generation APU shipments continued ramping, highlighted by the launch of our new PRO Series APUs earlier this month with HP. \\\\nCustomer and partner excitement for our Zen-based desktop product, Summit Ridge, is growing as we successfully passed several key engineering and design win  milestones in the quarter. We provided our first competitive performance preview of Summit Ridge in the quarter, and believe we will have a very competitive offering for the $4 billion high performance desktop processor market. We are working closely with our infrastructure partners and customers, in preparation for the launch in early 2017. \\\\nIn graphics, we had a very strong quarter, with discrete GPU revenue and unit shipments growing by double-digit percentages sequentially and year-over-year. The launch of our expanded family of Polaris desktop GPUs, and our first full quarter of RX 480 sales drove our highest quarterly channel GPU revenue and ASP since early 2014. Radeon RX GPUs now account for more than 50% of our channel GPU revenue. \\\\nPolaris GPUs continued to gain traction based on their leadership performance in VR and on the rapidly expanding number of software titles that feature the latest generation of APIs, like DirectX 12 and Vulkan. Our progress in the quarter was punctuated by Oculus, announcing a limited edition Oculus-ready PC, powered by an AMD FX processor, and Radeon RX 470 GPU that brings the cost of entry for a VR-ready system down to $500 for the first time. This is a meaningful milestone for consumers, and I am excited that AMD is enabling the ecosystem, and driving broader adoption of VR, by making premium experiences available at such an attractive price point.  \\\\nWe also delivered our fourth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth for our professional graphics products. In addition to solid workstation sales growth, we expanded our presence in the server GPU market, as HP announced availability of multiple Radeon options across their traditional and blade server offerings. And just last week, we announced the collaboration with Alibaba Cloud, China\\'s largest cloud provider, to deploy Radeon PRO server GPUs across their datacenters to expand the scale and services of their global cloud offering. \\\\nWe now have material server GPU engagement with multiple cloud datacenter providers, demonstrating that our strategy to grow our presence in this profitable market by delivering superior performance with Radeon PRO hardware, in conjunction with industry-standard programming tools and APIs, is beginning to pay off. Now, turning to our enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment. \\\\nRevenue increased 41% sequentially, and 31% from the year-ago period, driven by record semi- custom sales, which included the ramp of three new FinFET-based products powering the Xbox One S, updated PlayStation 4, and our new design win in the Sony PlayStation 4 Pro. We are on track to grow semi-custom unit shipments and revenue for the third straight year, demonstrating our leadership in high-performance gaming technologies for the very successful game console market. We expect fourth-quarter revenue to be down seasonally, as we transition from our annual semi custom sales peak in the third quarter. \\\\nOur embedded product sales grew sequentially, as our newer design wins reached production. In server, our Zen-based high-performance processor remains on track for introduction in the first half of 2017. We successfully passed several silicon and platform technical milestones in the quarter, and have secured multiple new design wins across OEM, enterprise, and cloud providers. \\\\nIn closing, as I complete my second year as CEO of AMD, I am pleased with the solid progress we have made across the Company on multiple operational, product, and financial fronts. We are executing our long-term strategy, and a set of near term priorities that I believe provide AMD with significant opportunities over the next 18 to 24 months, to drive top line revenue growth, operating margin expansion, and free cash flow generation. \\\\nWe have strengthened the core of the Company, by clearly defining the markets where we have technology and expertise to win; bringing a laser focus to our product execution around our graphics and microprocessor road map; creating deeper, more lasting relationships with strategic customers; monetizing our assets and valuable IP with two joint ventures in China; and reengineering our balance sheet to increase our cash balance and reduce debt. I want to thank the thousands of AMDers whose determination this past year has allowed us to put in place the financial and operational foundation to drive growth and profitability. \\\\nIn 2017, with Zen and Vega, we are focused on delivering our strongest product portfolio in over a decade, capable of unlocking multiple growth pillars for our business across the data center, gaming, and high performance graphics and PC markets. I am proud of what we have accomplished, and I believe that the best is yet to come. Now, I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder, to provide some additional color on our third-quarter financial performance. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Lisa, and a very good afternoon to everyone. In the third quarter, we achieved another milestone in our progress as we return to non-GAAP net income profitability. The third-quarter financial performance was driven by strong demand for our semi custom SoCs, higher graphics revenue, and positive free cash flow. \\\\nWe executed a series of capital markets transactions that have significantly improved our balance sheet, and turned that profile, and will reduce interest expense beginning in Q4. We also finalized a long-term strategic Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. \\\\nThird-quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 27% sequentially, driven by higher sales of our record semi custom SoCs and higher graphics processor sales. The year-over-year revenue increased 23%, driven by higher sales of our semi custom SoCs, client mobile processors, and graphics processors. \\\\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 31%, flat from the prior quarter, driven by a richer mix of PC and graphics products, offsetting lower margin semi custom product. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $353 million, up $11 million from the prior quarter, due to increased R&D investment. We recognized $24 million of net licensing gains, associated with our server JV with THATI. Non-GAAP operating income was $20 million this quarter, up $67 million from the prior quarter. \\\\nThird-quarter other net expense was $63 million, mostly consisting of a $61 million loss related to debt retirement. The equity loss in the ATMP JV was $5 million based on our 15% JV ownership stake. Non-GAAP net income was $27 million, with earnings per share of $0.03. \\\\nNon-GAAP EPS was calculated using 865 million diluted shares of common stock, which includes 12 million shares associated with the equity offering that closed late in the third quarter. Included in our GAAP operating loss and GAAP net loss is a $340 million charge associated with our fixed amendment to the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Adjusted EBITDA was $103 million, compared to $36 million in the prior quarter. \\\\nNow, turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $472 million, up 9% from the prior quarter, and up 11% year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales of GPUs and client mobile APUs. Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was $66 million, compared to $81 million the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue. \\\\nEnterprise embedded and semi custom revenue was $835 million, up 41% from the prior quarter, and 31% higher year-over-year, driven by higher semi custom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $136 million, up from $84 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up $301 million from the end of the prior quarter, including $274 million remaining from the proceeds of our capital market transaction. Excluding this amount, the cash was $984 million, as compared to $957 million last quarter. Free cash flow was a positive $20 million in the third quarter. \\\\nInventory was $772 million, up $29 million or 4% from the end of the prior quarter, in support of holiday season GPU and semi custom product sales expectations in the first part of the fourth quarter. Total wafer purchases from  GLOBALFOUNDRIES in third quarter were $168 million, and we continue to expect overall wafer purchases of approximately $650 million in 2016, including $155 million purchased in early 2016, as part of the fixed amendment to the WSA. \\\\nDebt as of the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter, due to our significant debt reduction effort. During the third quarter, we raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock, which includes the exercise of an underwriter\\'s option to purchase 15% or $90 million of additional common stock, and the issuance of $700 million in 2 1/8% convertible notes due in 2026. We used the majority of these funds to redeem outstanding term debt through cash tender offers, and we paid off the outstanding ABL balance of $226 million. \\\\nIn addition, early in the fourth quarter, another $105 million of convertible notes were issued as part of the exercise of an underwriter\\'s option, bringing the total principal amount of the 2026 convertible notes to $805 million. We also redeemed the remaining principal debt balance of $208 million of the 2020 senior note, which was our most expensive debt. This debt has now been fully paid off. \\\\nThe debt reductions and issuance of the new convertible notes due 2026 that occur in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter will result in approximately $55 million of annualized cash interest savings, beginning in the fourth quarter. Please refer to today\\'s CFO written commentary for further details of the capital markets transactions and debt on the balance sheet. Free cash flow in the third quarter was a positive $20 million, compared to a negative $106 million in the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased revenue, improvement in working capital, and a reduction in capital expenditures. \\\\nNow turning to our fourth quarter 2016 outlook, a 14 fiscal week quarter, as it has an extra week. We expect revenue to decrease 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by a seasonal decline in our semi custom business, and an improvement in our CG business. Revenue at the midpoint of guidance would be up 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 32%. \\\\nNon-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million. IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $25 million. To maintain non-GAAP operating profitability, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $32 million. Cash and cash equivalents to be up, in line with our guidance of ending 2016 with positive free cash flow, excluding cash from capital market transactions, and the net proceeds from the ATMP JV. \\\\nInventory to be down to approximately $660 million. Basic share count to be approximately 930 million, including 115 million shares related to the third-quarter equity issuance. And we now expect full-year revenue growth to be up approximately 6% from 2015, based on the midpoint of fourth quarter revenue guidance. \\\\nIn closing, we are very pleased with the progress we have made in the third quarter. With focused execution we continue to build a solid financial foundation for the Company. In just the last three months alone, we achieved non-GAAP net income profitability, amended the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES across multiple years, and deleveraged and derisked the balance sheet with our capital markets transaction, such that over the next five years, there is less than $200 million of term debt due. \\\\nWe look forward to continued execution, and further improving our financial performance. With that, I\\'ll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Devinder. Operator, we would be pleased to poll the audience for questions, please. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) \\\\nOur first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously a lot has gone on in the last quarter. I figured I would ask a couple things about Zen, since that\\'s been one of the things that\\'s most topical, in my conversations with investors. \\\\nLisa, you talked about in your prepared remarks, there are  multiple OEM engagements and design wins for desktop, and also the same on server. Maybe you could do a little bit to expand upon those? The timing of launch of each, and in particular in the server market, the focus, whether that be enterprise, or whether that be cloud-based. Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAbsolutely, Matt. Thanks for your question, and as you said, it\\'s been a very busy quarter for us. As it relates to Zen, we are on track to launch in the first half of the year, for both our desktops and our servers. The desktop launch will go first, and it is on track for the first quarter, and then the server launch will go in the second quarter. \\\\nWe\\'ve had a wide amount of sampling that\\'s gone on in the third quarter. We have multiple customers on both the PC side, as well as the server side, who have working hardware now in their labs. They\\'re bringing up their platforms and software, and we\\'re very pleased with how smoothly it\\'s coming up, actually. \\\\nSo you asked specifically about the server side. Our focus on servers is really across the OEM business, including enterprise, as well as the cloud data centers. And I think the key for us is we\\'re getting a lot of interest from our partners, and we continue to work with them to bring up their systems. But I think we are optimistic about where we are in the Zen bring-up, and the Zen launch cycle. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you for that. That\\'s helpful. I guess as a follow-up there, in the server market, I think obviously your GPU primary competitor has had some very stellar traction with server acceleration around GPUs, and you highlighted in the prepared remarks some wins and engagements that you had on Polaris, and I assume on Vega for server acceleration. \\\\nMaybe you could expand on that commentary a bit, what you\\'re investing there, how the GPUOpen, or the OpenCL Environment is developing relative to the CUDA environment in server acceleration, and just what proportion of your GPU business could be driven by that server opportunity in the long term? Any commentary there would be great. Thanks. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So let\\'s talk overall about our graphics business. So when you look at our graphics business, certainly we\\'re very pleased with the progress that we\\'ve made on the consumer side, with Polaris. But we\\'ve also mentioned that we\\'ve made good progress on the professional graphics side, including both workstations, as well as server GPUs. \\\\nI think the market is certainly very receptive to growth in the server GPU area. I was just at the Alibaba Cloud computing conference last week, where we announced our collaboration with them. They\\'re actually using parts that are pre-Polaris and pre-Vega. We were demoing a GPU-based cloud server based on some of our FirePro technology, using hardware-based virtualization. \\\\nI think the main feedback that we\\'ve gotten from them, as well as multiple other cloud engagements, is the hardware looks very good. We\\'re working with them on  the overall infrastructure and software to bring that up, and we believe that the products are very competitive in this market. And the market is nice because it\\'s certainly margin accretive, to the consumer side of the business. \\\\nSo we do expect as we bring out Vega in the first half of 2017, that will certainly strengthen the product portfolio. But there\\'s a lot of interest in the cloud space around what we\\'re doing with Radeon PRO and on the server GPU side. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much. I\\'ll get back in queue. Appreciate it.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.  \\\\n(Operator Instructions) \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWe can go to the next caller, operator. Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCertainly. Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI had two questions. First one, on the Alibaba deal, so this is not a new set of products you\\'re developing, it\\'s products you already have. And can you talk about, to the extent this is   a cloud services offering versus  deep learning applications, that they might be doing with your products? And I guess when I think about the architecture, I normally think about having an X86 processor sitting next to the GPU. I was wondering is it logical to assume that Zen is the natural X86 pairing with your GPUs in the Ali deployments? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Mark. So again, I think on the Alibaba deployment, it is the beginning of what we expect to be a long-term collaboration. So the work today is being done on a pre-Polaris base, but we do expect that will upgrade as we go forward. \\\\nI think the key is, there are many, many applications, but what we\\'re starting from is a GPU base cloud server application, so in virtualized environments, you can imagine cloud gaming or remote workstation-type environments which need a lot of graphics horsepower, as well as virtual desktop environments. And I think as we go forward, certainly, we view the opportunity to expand that into a broader set of workloads, as well as obviously on the CPU side as well. We think the cloud is a very important market for us to focus on, on both the GPU and the CPU side, and we\\'re ramping up our efforts there. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. A follow-up if I may. Last night Tesla announced that it was using NVIDIA for their self-driving car, but on the conference call Elon Musk, I think the expression he used, was that it was a tight decision between NVIDIA and AMD, which suggests that you\\'re further along in solutions for deep learning and neural networking than most, including myself, thought. \\\\nAnd so I was wondering, can you talk about your efforts in deep learning and artificial intelligence, how big is that business now? Do you have anything in that business now? And how do you grow that, going forward? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Mark. So look, there is a lot of interest in the deep learning space overall, and certainly our GPUs are very applicable to that space. So when we look at competitiveness and all that stuff, we think we can be very competitive there. \\\\nWe will be talking more about our strategy in the coming quarters, so maybe let me refer to that, Mark. But I think suffice it to say, I think we looked at GPUs as overall secular growth, whether you\\'re talking about consumer, professional workstations, server GPUs, or any of this machine learning area. So we\\'re going to continue to invest and lean in, in those areas. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa, Devinder, nice job on the quarter. I guess, Devinder first. Just going to the December quarter guidance, you\\'re characterizing it as seasonal. \\\\nI know  the trappings of talking about normal seasonal, because there\\'s so much variance around it, but it does seem like in prior quarters, where you had a 14th week, that extra week actually did help revenue a little bit. I\\'m just kind of curious within the context of the December quarter guidance, how you\\'re thinking about that extra week, both on the revenue line and on expenses. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think if you look at a 14-week quarter, I think, John, you\\'re right, it depends upon many factors. Our 14-week quarter is in the Q4 time frame, which is this quarter we are in. On the revenue side, I would say looking at it overall, there\\'s not much of an impact, as the extra week falls during the holiday season, when a large portion of our operations and our customers are in shutdown mode. There is an impact on the expense side, but that\\'s already contemplated within the guidance of OpEx that I gave, the $350 million due to the extra week. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s helpful. And then Lisa, a little bit longer term. Over the last  several quarters, you\\'ve been somewhat forced to try to manage profitability levels to that breakeven line, given the lack of revenue growth. \\\\nBut now that you\\'re on this path of more sustainable revenue growth, I\\'m just  curious as you think about R&D specifically, how should we think about your desire to want to invest in higher rates, as revenue begins to grow from these levels? Because clearly, as Mark talked about on the last question, you\\'ve got a lot of potential new areas and opportunities to go after. Can you give us a sense as to what -- to what degree you think you\\'ve been under-investing in R&D and how we should think about R&D investments over the next several quarters, as revenue growth  resumes? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAbsolutely, John. I think it\\'s fair to say that we\\'ve been very prudent in how we\\'ve invested overall. If you look at our operating expenses, 2016 to 2015, although we\\'ve been relatively flat overall, we\\'ve actually increased R&D, relative to other elements of the P&L. \\\\nBut as we see revenue growth and as we\\'ve seen progress over the last couple of quarters, I think you\\'ve also seen us increase our R&D spend. I think there are several areas that we see as very large opportunities, and we talked about some of the graphics areas in the previous question with Mark. I also think in the data center, there\\'s a large opportunity for us on the CPU side, as Zen fully comes to market. \\\\nSo I think we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in R&D as our revenue grows, but we\\'re still going to be very prudent with how we do that. I think the key metric there in terms of being net  income profitable this quarter, ensuring that we get free cash flow positive from operations for the full year, those are all important metrics for us, and we\\'re going to continue to manage very diligently. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s helpful. Thank you. Congratulations.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDo you expect GPU sales will grow sequentially in the December quarter, and what about computing revenues? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, so David, I think we would expect overall that the CG business or the Computing and Graphics business will grow in Q4. The EESC business will be down. And then within the Computing and Graphics business, I would expect growth on both the graphics, as well as the computing side. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. And do you have any new semi custom wins you can tell us about, or at least give us some idea of what the momentum is in the pipeline? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think on the semi custom side, David, I will say that we previously announced three, and that\\'s the number that we\\'ll talk about today. Two of them are now known, and they\\'re both in the game console area, one is outside of game console. I will say that we have some very good active discussions on   future products and applications, and we\\'ll update more as we get further along. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Thanks. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, David. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Hemmelgarn,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blaine. With Summit Ridge launching in Q1 of 2017,   how would you expect the channel to ramp that? Do you see it ramping pretty fully in the first couple quarters of the year, or are you looking for more normal PC seasonality? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI would expect that there will be a relatively good initial demand for Summit Ridge, that may be not quite at the seasonal patterns. From where we see, Summit Ridge is playing in a space in the high end desktop, that we currently aren\\'t offering a product. So we believe we\\'ll be competitive certainly with Core I5 as well as Core I7, and we will be launching in those areas. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Hemmelgarn,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks very much. Then looking at the GPU side of things, you saw some pretty nice share gains in the first half of this year with the legacy portfolio. Any metrics you can give to help frame how the business did in the first full quarter with Polaris? And any further color you can provide on how you see  the share situation progressing into the year-end. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWe\\'re very happy with how Polaris ramped in Q3. The customer demand across all geographies was very strong. Q3 was primarily a channel-based quarter. With our board partners, and as some of you noted, in the early part of Q3, we actually had some supply constraints, given the customer demand. We did catch up towards the end of the quarter. \\\\nSo very pleased with how that\\'s ramped. I think it\\'s a very competitive market. We\\'ve leaned into VR, and we\\'ve leaned into  our work with CX12 and I think you can see in some of the benchmarks that we\\'re doing very well there. As we go into Q4, in addition to the channel partners continuing to ramp, you should expect some OEMs launching in Q4 more broadly. And so Polaris is off to a very strong start. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Hemmelgarn,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks very much, Lisa, and congrats on the strong quarter.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI first wanted to ask about the second sourcing ability embedded in the new Wafer Supply Agreement. So you\\'ve said that you\\'re going to be doing some second sourcing,  starting in 2017. I wonder, did that push to actually seek out that supply diversification come from you, or was it from specific requests from your customers? And given that, how do you  make the decision on which products to manufacture at GLOBALFOUNDRIES versus manufacture somewhere else? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Stacy. Let me start with that. I think, relative to our second sourcing or our supply sourcing flexibility, I think we make it on a product-by-product basis, based on where we are in the business. So we will have multiple products in 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer that will be sourced across foundries, and similarly when we talked about the Wafer Supply Agreement, we mentioned 7-nanometer as being a key target node for that. \\\\nRelative to how we make the decisions, I think it\\'s a combination of factors. It includes the complexity of the product. It includes the timing, customers, all kinds of things. So I think that\\'s part of our product planning process. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. But did the customers themselves have a hand in driving you to make that push to second source? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think that\\'s one element, but frankly, I think what\\'s more important to me is, I need to commit a strong, five-year product road map to the customers, and so we want to make sure that we have all the flexibility to ensure nothing happens. I\\'ll give you just a little bit of context, Stacy, because I think you know our business well. \\\\nIn this past six months, we\\'ve ramped five new FinFET products. It\\'s the fastest transition we have ever made in a process node, and it\\'s gone really, really well. And I think what\\'s helped us with that is the fact that we\\'ve had two sources ramping at the same time. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. For my follow-up, I just want to get some clarification on the timing of the Summit Ridge and Zen launches. You said Summit Ridge launches obviously in Q1  2017. You had said before that you were going to be shipping at least some product in Q4 of this year. Is that still true? And around the server launch in Q2, does that mean the volume is actually in Q3? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo I think our expectation is, we may ship some production samples in Q4, but the volume launch for desktop will be in Q1, and that\\'s consistent with everything that we\\'ve planned into the business. And as it relates to server, I think it\\'s a little early to tell. I think we\\'ll go through our process, and our customers\\' processes, and we\\'ll have more color on that, as we get into next year. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. Thank you.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIn your prepared remarks, you mentioned semi custom\\'s decline and computing graphics to be up. Implies you\\'ll have a pretty rich mix for Q4. Why is GM guided up only 1% given the really strong mix for 4Q? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIf you look at it from an overall standpoint, let\\'s talk about Q2 to Q3, first of all. Q2 to Q3, we had a significant ramp in the semi custom space, which led to significant revenue in the EESC side,  and we were able to manage the margin flat quarter on quarter, which we are pleased with. Going to Q4, essentially with the Computing and Graphics business, that\\'s what Lisa said ramping, and then EESC business, in particular semi custom coming down. The gross margin is up a percentage point, primarily due to the mix in revenue between the two segments. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. And for a follow-up, a question on the cash balance. Looked like you\\'re guiding cash to be up in 4Q, and looks like you have some excess cash after the transactions you\\'ve done in the quarter, and looks like you might be up over your $1 billion target balance. How do you plan on using the excess cash, or where would you reinvest that cash? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think right now, as you observe, it\\'s through the end of Q3 we did have some remaining net proceeds from the capital market transactions. After completing what we did in the early part of Q4, we have about $162 million of remaining net proceeds. \\\\nWhat we plan to do with it, I think from a long-term strategy, that hasn\\'t changed. Our plan is to continue to delever the balance sheet, reduce debt towards our longer-term targets getting to the net debt cash neutral that I talked about previously, and getting the leverage ratio down to about 2 times from a longer term standpoint. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator, we\\'ll take two more questions, please. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCertainly. Our next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa, you talked about a $4 billion performance desktop opportunity. What\\'s your thinking in terms of what you can eventually attain of that, just how are you thinking about your potential for market share? And can you give us some sense for, when you have a chip like this, that you have enthusiasm about, how quickly it can ramp into that segment? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So I think if you look at our PC market share, as it\\'s published by Mercury, we\\'re talking about somewhere around 10%, plus or minus. I think we view that historically we\\'ve been higher than that in the PC market, and certainly the desktop market, especially the desktop channel market. We\\'re fairly well-known by that customer set. \\\\nSo we\\'re enthusiastic about Summit. We think the performance is right on the mark with what we wanted to achieve. And we\\'re hopeful that as we launch into the first quarter, that there will be a good, solid ramp in that business. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. And then, how are you thinking about as you think about bringing that chip to market, when will you make it available for third party benchmarks and sort of get a broader marketing program beyond the launch you\\'ve done? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI would expect certainly there are a lot of confidential benchmarks at the moment, but in terms of third party benchmarks, you would expect that in the first quarter. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group - Analyst    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCongrats on a great quarter, and nice to see it all coming together. We don\\'t have September sell-through data yet. It\\'s  hard to predict holiday season, what it\\'s going to look like for consoles. Perhaps the past two quarters\\' growth in EESC might be outpacing  expectations for consoles. \\\\nSo  my question is, first of all, is that right? Is there something that\\'s helping your guy\\'s units here, like initial channel stocking for the PS4 Slim or the PS4 Pro? And how should we think about the size of the benefit that you\\'re going to get from initial channel stocking there? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo, Chris, I think the game console shouldn\\'t be really looked at on a quarterly level, when you\\'re looking at sell-in and sell-out. It\\'s so different from the other markets. I would say on an annual basis, everything trues up. The thought process is, in Q2 and Q3, there is a bit of build ahead as the customers are really building for the holiday season. And the customers do so much of their business in the last six weeks of the year. That\\'s when all of the inventory is drained. \\\\nMy view is that if you look on an annual basis, the game console business is doing quite well. We expect units to be up. We expect revenue for the business to be up for us, and the quarterly transitions are less important. It\\'s more, we want to ensure that we\\'re meeting our customers\\' build cycles, so that they get to build everything that they want, and get it into their channels. But from my standpoint, I think it\\'s a very well-managed system. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group - Analyst    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Congrats on a great quarter.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator, that concludes today\\'s call. If you could  wrap it up, please, that would be great. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCertainly. That does conclude today\\'s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We do thank you for your participation today. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDefinitions\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nPRELIMINARY TRANSCRIPT: \\\\\"Preliminary Transcript\\\\\" indicates that the \\\\nTranscript has been published in near real-time by an experienced \\\\nprofessional transcriber.

Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. \\\\nFor the last 5 years, we have built the technical, operational and financial foundation required to drive our long-term growth strategy. We consistently executed on our product road maps, established deep partnerships with an expanded set of customers, ramped multiple products in leading-edge manufacturing technologies and significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Our strong second quarter results and increased full year revenue guidance demonstrate how we are successfully scaling our business through our consistent execution. \\\\nLooking at the second quarter, revenue grew 26% year-over-year to $1.93 billion, driven by strong demand for our leadership server and client processors. We accelerated our server and mobile processor businesses significantly in the quarter, resulting in Ryzen and EPYC processor revenue more than doubling year-over-year. Importantly, we met our double-digit server processor market share goal as data center products accounted for more than 20% of our second quarter revenue. \\\\nTurning to our Computing and Graphics segment, second quarter revenue increased 45% year-over-year to $1.37 billion as growth in Ryzen processor sales more than offset lower graphic sales. We delivered our highest client processor revenue in more than 12 years. Increased working and schooling from home due to COVID-19 resulted in a strong PC market in the quarter. Although we believe our growth was largely driven by our 11th straight quarter of market share gains. \\\\nDesktop processor sales decreased sequentially as anticipated, while revenue and ASP increased year-over-year as demand for our higher-end Ryzen processors drove a richer mix. In mobile, we had record quarterly notebook processor unit shipments and revenue. Sales of our latest Ryzen 4000 Series processors grew significantly in the quarter, resulting in mobile revenue growing by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially and more than doubling from a year ago as both unit shipments and ASP increased significantly. \\\\nMultiple third-party reviewers have consistently highlighted that our latest notebook processors deliver superior performance and longer battery life compared to the competition. As a result of this strong performance, I\\'m pleased to report that Ryzen 4000 processor revenue has ramped faster than any mobile processor in our history. There are now 54 Ryzen 4000-powered notebooks in the market. \\\\nWe expect to continue accelerating our mobile processor business in the second half of the year as HP and Lenovo ramp their first commercial notebooks powered by Ryzen Pro 4000 Series processors and a second wave of more than 30 ultrathin premium and gaming consumer notebooks launch from multiple OEMs. \\\\nIn Graphics, second quarter revenue declined year-over-year. A strong double-digit increase in mobile GPU sales was more than offset by lower desktop channel sales. While desktop GPU shipments were lower year-over-year, channel sell-out accelerated in the quarter. Mobile GPU revenue growth was driven by adoption of our RD&A GPUs, highlighted by the launches of new Apple Professional and Dell Gaming notebooks featuring our Radeon 5000M Series mobile GPUs. Data center GPU revenue decreased year-over-year. \\\\nWe expect revenue to increase in the second half of the year as additional cloud-based visual computing wins ramp and we launch our new CDNA data center GPU architecture optimized for next-generation exascale and machine learning workloads. \\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue of $565 million decreased 4% year-over-year due to lower semi-custom sales. Sequentially, revenue increased 62%, driven by record quarterly server processor sales and increased semi-custom product revenue. In semi-custom, we passed an important milestone in the second quarter as we began initial production and shipments of our next-generation game console SOCs. We expect strong second half semi-custom growth as we ramp production to support the holiday launches of the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles. \\\\nTurning to Server. Our focus since launching our EPYC processors has been on building a solid foundation to drive long-term growth. Our strategy is grounded in driving broad, high-volume adoption with widespread support from industry-leading cloud and hardware providers. We passed a significant milestone in the quarter as we achieved our double-digit server processor unit share goal based on broad adoption across cloud, enterprise and HPC customers. \\\\nIn cloud, multiple hyperscale customers ramped second-generation EPYC processors into high-volume production in the quarter to power both their internal infrastructure and publicly available instances. Microsoft announced they have added EPYC processors to power their Office Online applications used by more than 200 million monthly users. Tencent upped multiple millions of EPYC processor-powered virtual machines to support enhanced collaboration services. Google announced that EPYC processors were being used exclusively to power their unique confidential computing VMs that encrypt data while it is being processed. And AWS launched global availability of new compute-optimized EPYC-based EC2 instances. \\\\nIn enterprise, we have significantly expanded our TAM as the number of AMD platforms has increased by more than 40% so far this year. Recent additions include Dell and HPE introducing multiple hyperconverged infrastructure solutions; Lenovo launching dual-socket servers for financial, retail and manufacturing; and NVIDIA selecting AMD EPYC processors to power its latest DGX AI platforms. We also secured new HPC wins based on the leadership performance and scalability of second-gen EPYC processors. Public highlights include new wins with leading research institutions, including Indiana University, Purdue and CERN as well as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle all announcing cloud-based HPC offerings powered by EPYC processors. \\\\nWe are pleased with the momentum in our Server business and expect to continue gaining share as additional second-gen EPYC platforms and cloud deployments ramp to volume in the second half of the year. We remain on track to begin shipping our next-generation Milan server processor, featuring Zen 3 late this year. \\\\nIn closing, I want to thank our employees and partners for the strong execution during this unprecedented time as we continue to focus on delivering on our commitments. While there continues to be some macroeconomic uncertainty and pockets of demand softness, our product portfolio is very strong, and our markets are resilient. We are on track to deliver strong growth in the second half of the year driven by our current product portfolio and initial shipments of our next-generation Zen 3 CPUs and RDNA 2 GPUs that are on track to launch in late 2020. \\\\nI am very proud of the progress we have made over the last few years, placing AMD on a long-term growth trajectory. I\\'m even more excited about the opportunities in front of us as we enter our next phase of growth driven by accelerating our business in multiple markets. We remain focused on consistently gaining share across the $79 billion market for our high-performance products. We are investing significantly and have added resources to further extend our leadership IP and go-to-market capabilities as we pursue our ambitious goal to make AMD a best-in-class growth franchise. \\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. \\\\nWe executed the second quarter very well. Amidst the COVID-19 backdrop, we delivered strong financial results, introduced industry-leading products and gain CPU market share. The second quarter results and increased full year revenue guidance highlight our ability to consistently deliver on our commitments as we continue to drive long-term financial growth. \\\\nSecond quarter revenue was $1.93 billion, up 26% from a year ago and 8% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. Gross margin was 44%, up 330 basis points from a year ago driven by client and server processor sales. Operating expenses were $617 million compared to $512 million a year ago, primarily due to ongoing investments in the business. Operating income more than doubled year-over-year to $233 million, up $122 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth. Operating margin increased to 12% as compared to 7% a year ago. Net income was $216 million, up $124 million from a year ago, and diluted earnings per share were $0.18 per share compared to $0.08 per share a year ago. \\\\nNow turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.37 billion, up 45% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in Ryzen process sales. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $200 million or 15% of revenue compared to $22 million or 2% of revenue a year ago. Enterprise Embedded and semi-custom segment revenue was $565 million, down 4% year-over-year due to lower semi-custom sales, which were largely offset by higher EPYC processor sales. EESC segment operating income was $33 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating income of $89 million a year ago. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, including $200 million from our revolving line of credit, which was fully repaid in the third quarter. Inventory was $1.3 billion, up 25% from the prior quarter in anticipation of the revenue ramp in the second half of 2020 and new product launches. Free cash flow was $152 million in the second quarter. I am very pleased with our cash performance in the quarter, which resulted in the first quarter of the year -- or the first half of the year being free cash flow positive. \\\\nLet me now turn to the outlook for the third quarter of 2020. Today\\'s outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current COVID-19 environment, global economic backdrop and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to be approximately $2.55 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 42% year-over-year and approximately 32% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential increases are expected to be driven by higher Ryzen and EPYC processor sales and next-generation semi-custom products. In addition, for Q3 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 44%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $660 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $25 million and the diluted share count in the third quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares. \\\\nFor the full year 2020, we now expect higher annual revenue growth up approximately 32% driven by the strength of our PC, gaming and data center products. We continue to expect gross margin of approximately 45% for the full year, up 2 points from the prior year. \\\\nIn closing, while there continues to be global economic uncertainty due to COVID-19, we have significant opportunities ahead of us with strong product demand across multiple markets. We are in a good position to accelerate our financial momentum, expand gross margins and generate significant cash. \\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Devinder, and operator, please pool the audience for the question-and-answer session.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nA question for Lisa. You\\'ve said in the past that your customers they don\\'t buy CPUs but they buy road maps. And I was hoping that you could tell us about your road map, particularly in servers going forward, how it compares to your competition? And does your -- as part of that, does your view of the competitive environment change after your biggest competitor last week noted a push in its 7-nanometer processor?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, Mark. Yes, thanks for the question. So look, we\\'ve been very focused over the last couple of years on our road map and our strategy, and for sure, when we talk to our customers, it\\'s about ensuring that they understand we have a consistent road map that is pushing the leading edge of performance and ensuring that we deliver the performance improvements that we promise. \\\\nAs you know, with these road maps, many of these decisions are made years in advance. And so we look at process technology as well as design and architecture and leading-edge packaging. So we feel good about our road map. We just -- we updated our road maps at our financial Analyst Day in March, and we continue to be very focused on executing to our road maps.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd on the -- and when you talk about the -- your focus both on your transistor or the process and the architectural lead, can you give us a sense to what extent the share gains that you\\'re taking right now are driven by one or the other or both? And would you expect to maintain a lead in both as you launch Milan and further on down in \\'21 and \\'22?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, look, I would say that the road map is dependent on all of those factors. So you have to get the process technology and manufacturing right. We feel good about our road map there and our partnership with TSMC. And you also have to make the right design and architectural decisions, and we feel good about our CPU road map. So right now, we are on Zen 2 with Rome. We saw a very nice acceleration of our data center business due to some of the key customers that have launched. We are on track or we expect to start shipping Milan here late this year. And then we\\'re also working in development on Zen 4, which is slated for 5-nanometer.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd congratulations on the strong growth despite all of the headwinds. Lisa, for my first one, when I think back to the last time AMD was really big in the server market was in that 2004 to 2006 time frame, when market share went from 7% to 26% in kind of that 3-year-or-so period. How would you contrast the current environment, right, from -- whether it\\'s from a competitive perspective or just a customer willingness to adopt your platform? What will it take for your market share to kind of approach those peaks? What are the puts and takes, and how different or similar is your experience now?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, sure, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, the server market, we\\'ve said, is very strategic for us. We think there\\'s a high demand for sort of pushing the leading edge of performance. When I look at our road map right now, I feel very good about our road map. I think we have executed well to our road map. I think we are differentiated in terms of the performance that we\\'re offering in the server market. \\\\nWe\\'ve always said that the data center market is a bit of a journey, and so this is about putting together multiple generations of strong execution. So we\\'re pleased with where we are with Rome and the progress that we\\'ve made this year. I would say we\\'re still in the early innings of what we believe we can do in the server market. I think Rome is a very, very competitive product. I think as we go into Milan, we see that as also a very competitive product. And our goal is to really satisfy a broad swath of the server workloads, and we think we have the capabilities of doing that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. For my follow-up, Lisa, so you raised full year growth outlook to 32% or so, I believe, from 25%. Can you give us some more color on what in that upside? How much of that is coming from PCs? How much from server? How much from semi-custom? And I noticed that you kept the gross margin outlook kind of steady, and I\\'m wondering how do we think about gross margins going forward? How sensitive is that to your success in the server market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So we did update full year guidance. When we look at sort of what\\'s changed over the last 90 days, when we were here talking to you in April, we were actually expecting that there might be some COVID-19-related weakness in the second half due to macroeconomic factors or other things like that. What we see now is better visibility into the second half of the year, and so we had originally assumed that the PC market would be down in the second half. And we now expect that PCs -- that we will grow in the PC processors for the second half compared to the first half. We also see data center growing from the second half to the first half. And then we have our game console ramp that is a strong ramp here in the second half. \\\\nSo I think it\\'s a number of factors. We do believe that the market is a little bit better than we thought 90 days ago. But we also believe that our product traction is strong, and we\\'re seeing that come through with our customer demand. So those are the reasons for the guidance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnything on gross margins?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOh, I\\'m sorry. Yes. On gross margins, I think that depends a lot on mix. That depends on -- certainly, your question was about server. Server is certainly accretive to margin. And I think in the PC business, the second half of the year tends to be a bit more consumer-focused and notebook-focused. And so that\\'s some of the mix relation there. And then we\\'ve said that the consoles are decretive to margin. We expect that consoles will be very strong in the third quarter. And although the fourth quarter will be lower for consoles, it\\'s still going to be a very strong second half of the year. So those are the puts and takes there, but we feel that the mix is about right to -- for the annual guide at 45%.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa, I wanted to ask about the PC market, and you just gave some comments about maybe some stronger trends than you might have anticipated 90 days ago in the back half. But pretty remarkable for a notebook business to more double and for the second quarter to be your record client sales. I wonder if you might talk about the momentum, particularly in the notebook market of the 4000. And then how are you feeling the pull of the enterprise notebook market? And what\\'s the traction like there so far into the back half?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Matt. So the PC market was strong for us, and the PC business was strong for us in the second quarter and as we look into the second half. What we saw was that desktops were down as expected, but the COVID-19-type phenomenon has increased, overall, the PC market. And we see a strong shift from desktop to notebooks. At the same time, I think our notebook portfolio, particularly the Ryzen 4000, has done extremely well. We\\'ve seen strong adoption. We have over 50 platforms in market. We watch the sell-through and the consumption of those. And I would say it has been very strong, even exceeded our expectations for the early ramp. \\\\nAnd our view is that the second half will continue to be good for notebooks and PCs overall. And that\\'s part of this idea that PCs are now essential. And so we see strength in consumer. We see strength in gaming notebooks, which we had previously been underrepresented. We have a nice commercial ramp, and we do see good pipeline around commercial PCs as well as the education market is quite strong as well. So you put that together, and I think the PC business has performed well for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. As a follow-up, maybe a piece of the business that\\'s been asked about a little less frequently over the last few quarters is your gaming GPU business. And I\\'m interested if you could just put into context what the expectations are for improvements and new opportunities for Big Navi as you launch later this year? And maybe size those opportunities from a data center perspective versus what you might expect in the gaming channel?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So I think the Graphics, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, was down year-over-year. We saw a nice ramp of mobile as we launched some of the Navi-based mobile products, but the desktop channel was lower. This was somewhat as expected from the standpoint of the second quarter is usually a lower quarter for the desktop channel. \\\\nWhat we did see is that sell-through was pretty good, so I think gaming overall is good. We are in the process of a product transition. We are on track to launch RDNA 2 or, as you call it, Big Navi late this year. We\\'re excited about the RDNA 2 architecture. I think it\\'s a full refresh for us from the top of the stack through the rest of the stack. And so I think that will be more of a contributor here as we go into later this year and into next year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGood job on the quarterly execution. Could you see the team hit the double-digits percentage market share targets and a broadening out of the end market penetration with EPYC, just Lisa, just given your customer and design win pipeline and rollout of Milan in the back half of this year, how are you thinking or how should we be thinking about further EPYC share gains over the next 12 to 18 months?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Harlan. So look, we are optimistic about our product positioning in the server market. Much of what we\\'ve been doing up through now, frankly, is making sure that our customers were ready to take advantage of Rome and EPYC. And so we saw some nice traction here in the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter around some top cloud accounts that have started to ramp in good volume. As we look forward to the second half of the year, there are more platforms coming with Rome. We have a number of OEM platforms that are in the process of being launched. And we have additional cloud platforms as well. So I think Rome is going to continue to be a strong driver of our growth into the second half of this year as well as next year. \\\\nWe\\'re excited about Milan. Milan is looking good in the labs. We\\'re working with our customers on Milan, and we expect to start shipping that later this year. So I think the way to think about our Server business is, again, it\\'s a journey, and we\\'re pleased with where we are today, but there\\'s a significant opportunity for us if we continue to execute well over the next, I would say, more than 12 to 18 months. But really, we see this as a multiyear opportunity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, absolutely. And then as a follow-up, we do an annual CIO survey here at JPMorgan. For the past 3 years, we\\'ve been asking global CIOs, are they thinking about or planning to use EPYC-based platforms for on-prem. And then the most recent survey that we did in June, we actually saw a 60% year-over-year increase in the number of CIOs that are thinking about using EPYC for on-prem. Our interpretation is that interest level and mind share is growing quite rapidly. I guess my question to you, Lisa, is the AMD -- what is the A&D team seeing from an actual adoption perspective? And what\\'s your sense of your enterprise mix sort of 2 to 3 years from now?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Actually, Harlan, I saw that data, and I thought it was good data. So the -- what I would say is that we are making progress in the enterprise business. And that comes from a number of different factors. First is the availability of platforms. We have a very diverse set of platforms from our OEM partners that are now in market. We\\'ve also done quite a bit on the ecosystem and ensuring that we have the partnerships with the ISVs, and then just basically feet on the street where we\\'re talking directly to some of these enterprise customers. So I feel good about the progress that we\\'ve made. \\\\nAgain, I would refer to the fact that mind share is a leading indicator, but there is a lot for us to do to convert that into market share and revenue growth. But we feel like we\\'re on a good path, and we\\'re going to continue to focus on both cloud and enterprise growth. And I\\'ll also mention, HPC is another key vector for us, where we\\'re very focused on showing a strong value proposition for those sort of toughest, most scientific workloads.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. To stay away from the previous question, can you talk a little bit about your enterprise prospects on the PC client side? Can you give us a sense for how much at this point of your business is skewed to consumer? And how much progress are you making there in terms of penetrating enterprise business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Joe. No question, our business is more consumer-weighted today. I will say we\\'re growing nicely in commercial PCs. I think the strength of the Ryzen 4000 product has been good for us. I think there\\'s a lot of positivity around the performance, the battery life, the capabilities there. We continue to expand our go-to-market efforts there. We\\'re partnering very well with our top OEM partners. So I would say that we\\'re still underrepresented in commercial. But no question that commercial notebook is a big focus for us, and we\\'re going to continue to invest and hopefully make progress in that subsegment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. And then as a follow-up, there\\'s been a bunch of press about console builds getting revised up meaningfully by several million units coming from Nikkei. And yet your upside for the year seems fairly balanced across the segments. Can you give us just color on what\\'s happening in that console segment? Is there that much upside? And could your numbers prove conservative as we move through the back half?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So I will say that our upside is balanced across the segments. There\\'s no question that there\\'s a strong ramp in the second half of the year for consoles. We\\'re continuing to increase supply to meet that demand. But overall, I view it as -- again, consoles are a multiyear cycle, and the first year, I mean, there\\'s a lot of pent-up demand for consoles, but we should think about this as really a multiyear cycle, and this is just the beginning of the ramp.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI wanted to follow-up on that capacity point. What is your capacity and supply situation look like? And is any of the full year raise related to capacity freeing up at your foundry partners? And maybe put another way, are you supply rather than demand-limited at this point? What does that capacity situation look like?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, sure, Stacy. So look, we have a strong supply chain. There\\'s no question. It\\'s been a very dynamic year if you just think about all the puts and takes over the last 4 or 5 months. I\\'ve said before and I\\'ll say again, 7-nanometer is tight, and we continue to partner closely with TSMC to ensure that we can satisfy our customer demand. \\\\nWhen you ask about the full year raise, the full year raise is because demand has gone up from our initial expectations, and some of that is due to the market, and some of that is due to the strength of our product traction. We are increasing capacity to meet those needs, but it is tight. And I would say that as we continue to increase capacity, we see opportunity there. So from that standpoint, demand is strong.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nFor my follow-up, your competitor was talking about data center -- potential for data center digestion into the second half. And I understand you\\'re coming from a different place with the new product ramps and everything, so I understand why you are growing in the second half one way than not. But what are you seeing just broadly with your customers? Are you seeing signs of the market within hyperscale entering the digestion phase, even if it\\'s not impacting you for well-understood reasons?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Stacy, I think it\\'s a bit hard to generalize. And from our visibility, what I would say is we have some customers that we see demand increasing in the second half versus the first half. We have some customers who are a little bit lower. The main thing for us, and I think you said it, it\\'s about the ramping of our platforms. And so I\\'m not sure I would point to a particular digestion phenomena. I would say it\\'s very customer-dependent and depending on how much they built out in the first half and some customers will be up, and some customers will be a little bit down. But overall, we see an opportunity to grow in the second half.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. Is that the same across our hyperscale and enterprise? Or is it mostly hyperscale that\\'s driving it?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo my comment was a hyperscale comment, since that\\'s what you were asking about. When I look at enterprise, what I would say about enterprise is it\\'s also -- different things happening. I would say in terms of enterprise and HPC, we continue to see build-out. And as I said, we have new platforms ramping that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. \\\\nThere is a bit of softness in SMB or some of the transactional business, and again, we were not very exposed to that portion of the market. So I don\\'t see it as it\\'s going down, it\\'s just perhaps not increasing as fast as we wanted it to. But overall, it really depends on customer-specific stuff. And we don\\'t see sort of this large-scale people slowing down, I would say it that way. I think there\\'s a need for infrastructure, and we see people continuing to invest in infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCongratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the data center GPU business. I know you talked about the path for the CD&A product going forward. I\\'m just curious, as you look to your cloud opportunities, how do you gauge or how are you thinking about the ability to kind of participate in some of the AI opportunities in the data center GPU business? And do you have any update on kind of [RAKM] and how that has opened up opportunities or what we should expect from a software platform perspective?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, sure, Aaron. So look, I think the data center GPU business is a -- is sort of a midterm growth vector for us. This year, I mentioned in the second quarter that revenue was lower year-on-year, but the second half, we expect it to go up modestly. I think the view is we have good design wins in cloud gaming, we have good design wins across sort of cloud, VDI-type instances. Very strong in supercomputing and HPC around Frontier and El Capitan as sort of our anchor supercomputing wins. \\\\nAs it relates to machine learning and AI, we continue to invest in [RAKM]. We continue to work sort of our strategy around machine learning is partnered deeply with a couple of large cloud vendors who can invest in the software with us. And we see that as a multiyear opportunity. But it will -- it\\'s not a big revenue contributor here in 2020. But we see a growth opportunity as we go into 2021 and beyond.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. And then as a quick follow-up, we talked a lot about kind of just ramping EPYC and the road map. I\\'m just curious of how you\\'ve invested in the support organization to support this expansion, how has that progressed? Has that been at all a limiting factor to some of your ability in the server CPU market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. I think in server CPUs, it just takes time. There\\'s a customer qualification process that takes time. But we have -- we\\'ve been very pleased with sort of the efforts on both the part of our customers as well as sort of our own support teams. We\\'re continuing to invest, so if you look at our OpEx, we\\'re continuing to invest. One of the key areas is building out, not just that support infrastructure, but just overall sales and go-to-market for the enterprise business. \\\\nSo I feel good about where we are. Our strategy was always to go through some of the top cloud customers first, and I\\'m really pleased to see some of those get to high volume production, and we\\'ll continue to build out that infrastructure in both cloud as well as enterprise.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI guess, Lisa, I wanted to ask maybe in the past month or 6 weeks or even 2 months since it\\'s become probably more apparent to the customers that your competitors are having some manufacturing issues. Can you speak a little bit to the tenor of the customer conversations? Has it changed at all? Have you felt them incrementally more willing to adopt your products?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. I don\\'t think I would say -- I mean, 4 to 6 weeks is kind of a short time. I think I would back up a little bit and say, over the past couple of quarters, what have we seen? And I think over the past couple of quarters, what we have seen is they\\'ve seen our performance capability, and we feel very good about where our products are positioned. I think what we\\'ve also said is, look, you can count on us for a consistent road map, and we\\'re going to show you each of those data points. \\\\nI think the Milan point is an important point for us, and that\\'s why we\\'re very focused on ensuring that, that ships here later this year. I think the Zen 4 general point, we\\'ve already started engaging customers. Customers are very eager to understand what the long-term road map is. \\\\nAnd so what I would say is it\\'s not sort of a short-term thing. It\\'s more the notion of -- we feel that customers are very open across cloud, OEM, enterprise. It\\'s on us to execute, and we think about that every day. But in terms of where the road map is, what are we trying to accomplish, where the customers are, there\\'s a pull from customers to engage us across a number of workloads, we feel well positioned.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. And then I guess, also in data center, I think you\\'ve highlighted before that a potential bottleneck might be to build out your software capabilities, and can you -- are there any metrics you can give us in terms of your ability to attract talent? Has that improved recently sort of in terms of the number of software engineers you\\'ve hired? Anything like that to help?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So I think if you\\'re talking about software, it\\'s more of a GPU -- a data center GPU statement versus a CPU statement. I think we feel actually that our CPU tools, infrastructure and all that stuff is actually pretty well built out. There is some work that we do with some of the applications and the ISVs to optimize and tune our software, but I think that\\'s going very well. \\\\nAs it relates to the data center GPU, yes, I think there is more mind share. I think the supercomputing wins in the data center GPU side have really helped raise the profile of our GPU capabilities and our software capabilities. So I think we are in a good position there. And from our standpoint, again, this is about building out sort of multiple vertical applications and doing that very well. So we continue to invest in the data center. It is a very strategic part of our business, but we\\'re making good progress.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI wanted to focus on a little bit of a different topic, kind of comparing x86 and ARM. So I\\'m sure you guys saw the announcement that Apple is displacing Intel with its own ARM-based chip. And historically, the reason why you couldn\\'t really use an ARM-based chip because there was no real developers around it. \\\\nSo I guess, is there any risk -- or how do you guys think about ARM-based servers becoming a potential competitive threat in the future? How would that impact the x86 market and Intel as well? So do you have any comments on that in terms of Apple\\'s potential entrance in developing an ARM-based seeker system?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. I think what I would say is there are going to be some people who develop their own chips. Apple has announced it in the MAC space, and there are some who are building their own in the data center space. I still believe this is not about ARM versus x86. I think it\\'s more about what performance do you offer, what capabilities do you offer, where the overall ecosystem is. \\\\nAnd in that sense, I think we still feel quite confident that both the PC market as well as the server processor market are predominantly x86. I think there\\'s a very good set of offerings out there that are available. And it\\'s on us -- frankly, on us to make sure that the performance that you get, the power that you get, the performance per dollar, the capabilities are very, very competitive so that we\\'re offering sort of the best-in-class processors in the market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. And then just one small one follow-up. Just on the data center 20% of revenues, is still -- the data center graphics piece still a small part of the business? Or was that better this quarter? I\\'m just trying to get a qualitative understanding of what happened there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, Mitch. So we did say that overall data center revenue was over 20% of revenue this quarter, and it was predominantly CPUs. So the GPU portion of that is still relatively small.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo just to be clear, GPUs were not -- were basically flat sequentially? Or were they up?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThey were actually down sequentially.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCongrats on the strong results. Lisa, I actually had one short-term question and one long-term question for you. On the short-term side of things, you have some significant moving parts with new product launches, et cetera, in both the third and fourth quarter. So I was hoping, on the 32% sequential guide, if you can give a little color by the 2 end markets, the C&G and the EESC side? And then a similar sort of thing when you go into the fourth quarter, you said semi-custom will be down sequentially, which is kind of typical seasonality. But the ability for you guys to still grow sequentially, what\\'s really driving that? And then I\\'ll follow-up with the long-term question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. So let\\'s see. Let me try to do that. So I think -- so when you talk about the Q3 guide, so 32% sequentially, there is a large component of that, which is game consoles. So the game console revenue was relatively modest in the second quarter, and it\\'s going to become larger here in the third quarter. But we do see PCs growing sequentially as well as server CPUs growing sequentially. \\\\nAnd then as we go into the fourth quarter, I mentioned earlier that we expect that semi-custom will be down a bit, probably not as much as it\\'s historically down, frankly, because it\\'s the first year of the launch, but it should be down a bit. And then we do have product launches that we\\'ve stated around sort of the Zen 3 product families as well as the RDNA 2 product families that would drive some of the sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Did I answer that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. That\\'s exactly what I wanted. And then maybe this one will be a little clearer on the long-term side of things. An earlier question was asked about OpEx and expanding your capabilities, et cetera, and you gave a thoughtful answer to that. But generally speaking, it seems like your opportunities to take share in aggregate just improved due to your competitors\\' missteps. \\\\nSo when you look at that opportunity, how do you think about organic investments? Would OpEx staying at, say, 29% of revenues like you\\'re talking about for this year, be a good way to capitalize on that opportunity as opposed to going down to the 26% or 27% you mentioned at your analyst meeting? Or within that, would you keep that a little bit tighter in line with your analyst meeting and maybe even consider going inorganic and tapping into the M&A market now that you have some cash and a very attractive currency to use as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So yes, let me answer it this way. So look, we are very excited about our organic growth opportunities. I think we want to stay sort of at that sort of very significant growth in that over 20% CAGR for the next couple, 3 or 4 years. I think the way we\\'ve managed the business is the prudent way to manage the business. \\\\nAnd so OpEx will grow. OpEx will grow, and you\\'ve seen it in the dollar numbers, but it\\'s going to grow a little bit slower than revenue. And we think that\\'s the right thing to do just to make sure that we do see some leverage. That being the case, because the business is growing so much, I mean, we are investing quite heavily in OpEx across the business in both R&D and go to market. \\\\nSo what was the second part of your question, Ross?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWhich is the inorganic way, would that be an avenue to broaden your offering to some of your customers?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, look, I think we have been focused on the organic growth path because there is so much opportunity there. We\\'ll look -- we\\'ll always keep an eye open for are there opportunities to enhance the portfolio or do some skills acquisition if that makes sense. But I think we\\'re very focused on executing the organic growth path.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur final question today is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCongratulations on a strong quarter. Lisa, it\\'s really great to see embedded in the implied fourth quarter guide a gross margin that needs to go up about 200 basis points sequentially to meet your full year guidance. And especially with gaming consoles being down less than seasonal, I\\'m wondering if you can just help me unpack that a little bit. \\\\nWhen you think about the gaming console cycle, is the gross margin improvement available to you as that cycle ramps and matures? And I guess more importantly, when you look at both the PC market and the server fleet, where are you relative to optimal product mix vis-\\\\u00e0-vis kind of longer-term gross margin aspirations?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, sure. So obviously, there\\'s a lot to happen between now and the fourth quarter. But I think from the guide, what you get is we see the server and PC growth generally positive. If you think about what we have planned from now through the rest of the year, we do have some significant new products that will start shipping that will be positive from a gross margin standpoint. \\\\nOn a console basis, it is true that the console margins typically improve. Over the first sort of 4 to 6 quarters, because you would expect that, as we ramp into higher volume, that there are improvements in manufacturing costs and so on and so forth. So those are the factors that are in there. \\\\nA lot will depend on mix, and the mix of the business being what is a mix of consumer versus commercial on the PC side, and then on the data center side, the mix between cloud and enterprise. And so we have to see how some of those things play out as we go out through the end of the year. But overall, I think the trend is such that you should see sequential growth in the gross margins as we go into the fourth quarter for some of the reasons that I mentioned.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s helpful. And then Lisa, as a follow-on, you\\'ve always talked about this being a marathon more than a sprint, and you guys have had a pretty methodical strategy to which you\\'ve executed to. But I just -- given the revelations of Intel\\'s missteps last week, what might you do differently from here to try to take advantage of it?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, John, I think the most important thing for us is to execute to our commitments to customers, and that -- by the way, that\\'s been the same focus for us over the last few years, and it will continue to be the same focus for the next few years. I think consistency in road map, consistency in performance expectations, being capable of ramping across -- basically, what we\\'re asking is for people to trust us with their most important applications. \\\\nAnd so our focus is very much execute on the road map that we\\'ve committed to, and that\\'s key for us. And no question, there\\'s a lot of things to do in engineering to make that happen. But I think we\\'re very clear on what we want to deliver, and we\\'re excited, frankly, about the road map we have in front of us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, everybody, for joining the call today.

We had a stellar Q4 and FY17, with records in all of our financial metrics -- revenue, gross margin, operating margins, and EPS. Growth was driven primarily by data center tripling, with a rapid adoption of AI worldwide. Quarterly revenue reached $2.17 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, and up 8% sequentially, and above our outlook of $2.1 billion.\\\\nFY17 revenue was just over $6.9 billion, up 38%, and nearly $2 billion more than FY16. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year was broad-based, with record revenue in each of our four platforms -- gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Our full-year performance demonstrates the success of our GPU platform-based business model.\\\\nFrom a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 57% to $1.85 billion from a year earlier. Tegra processor revenue was up 64% to $257 million.\\\\nLet\\'s start with our gaming platform. Q4 gaming record revenue was a record $1.35 billion, rising 66% year on year, and up 8% from Q3. Gamers continue to upgrade to our new Pascal-based GPUs. Adding to our gaming lineup, we launched GTX 1050-class GPUs for notebooks, bringing e-sports and VR capabilities to mobile at great value. The GTX 1050 and 1050-TI were featured in more than 30 new models launched at last month\\'s consumer electronics show.\\\\nTo enhance the gaming experience, we announced G-Sync HDR, a technology that enables displays which are brighter and more vibrant than any other gaming monitor. Our partners have launched more than 60 G-Sync-capable monitors and laptops, enabling smooth play without screen tear artifacts. E-sports too continues to attract new gamers. Major tournaments with multi-million dollar purses are drawing enormous audiences.\\\\nThis last quarter, Dota 2 held its first major tournament of the season in Boston. Tickets sold out in minutes. The prize pool reached 3 million, and millions of gamers watched online.\\\\nMoving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew 11% from a year ago to a record $225 million, driven by demand for high-end real time renderings and mobile workstations. We recently launched a family of Pascal-based GPUs designed for mobile workstations, which leading OEMs are embracing.\\\\nEarlier this week, we introduced Quadro GP100, which creates a new super-computing workstation. This new type of workstation enables engineers, designers, and artists to take advantage of new technologies of photo-realism, fluid simulation, and deep learning.\\\\nNext, data center. Revenue more than tripled from a year ago, and was up 23% sequentially to $296 million. Growth was driven by AI, cloud service providers deploying GPU instances, high-performance computing, grid graphics virtualization, and our DGX AI super-computing appliance.\\\\nAI is transforming industries worldwide. The first adopters were hyper-scale companies like Microsoft, Facebook, and Google, which use deep learnings to provide billions to customers with AI services that utilizes image recognition and voice processing. The next area of growth will occur as enterprise in such fields as health care, retail, transportation, and finance embrace deep learning on GPUs.\\\\nAt November\\'s SC16 super-computing conference, Microsoft announced that its GPU-accelerated Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is available both in Azure Cloud and on-premesis with our DGX-1 AI super-computer. In a series of related announcements at SC16, we described our plans to join the Cancer Moonshop project, in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute, the US Department of Energy, and several national labs.\\\\nTo help build predictive models and guide treatment under those projects, we are collaborating on a new AI framework called CANDLE, the Cancer Distributed Learning Environment. To support this work, we unveiled our new own super-computer, the NVIDIA DGX Saturn 5, which joins together 124 DGX-1 systems. It\\'s currently the world\\'s 28th fastest super-computer, and the number one system in energy efficiency.\\\\nOur grid graphics virtualization business doubled year on year, driven by strong growth in the education, automotive, and energy sectors. We are excited to be hosting our eighth annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley from May 8 to May 11. This will be the year\\'s most important event for AI and accelerating computing, and we expect it to be our largest GTC yet, attended by thousands of application developers, scientists and academics, as well as entrepreneurs and corporate executives.\\\\nFinally, in automotive, revenue grew to a record $128 million, up 38% year over year. At Jen-Hsun\\'s CES opening keynote, we demonstrated our leadership position in self-driving vehicles. With a growing list of industry players adopting our AI car platform, we also showcased AI Copilot, a technology that will recognize a driver and their preferences, monitor their alertness, understand natural spoken language, and provide alerts in dangerous situations.\\\\nOne of the highlights of CES was the demonstration of our own autonomous car, dubbed BB8. More than 500 passengers took rides in the back seat without a driver behind the wheel. We announced a number of new partnerships at the show, among them were collaborations with Bosch, the world\\'s largest automotive supplier, and ZF, Europe\\'s leading supplier for the truck industry. Both center on developing AI car computers with Drive PX2 technology.\\\\nWe also announced that we\\'re working on cloud-to-car mapping collaborations with HERE, focused on the US and Europe, and Zen Ren, focused on Japan. These complement partnerships announced in Q3 with Europe\\'s TomTom, and China\\'s Baidu. Our mapping partnerships now span to all geographies.\\\\nJen-Hsun was joined on the CES stage by Audi of America\\'s President Scott Keogh. They announced the extension of our decade-long partnership to deliver cars with level four autonomy starting in 2020, powered by Drive PX technology. Audi will deliver level three autonomy in its A-8 luxury sedan later this year through its V-fast system, powered by NVIDIA. We also shared news at CES of our partnership with Mercedes-Benz to collaborate on a car that will be available by year\\'s end.\\\\nDuring the quarter, Tesla began delivering a new autopilot system powered by the NVIDIA Drive PX2 platform in every new Model S and Model X, to be followed by the Model 3. Tesla\\'s cars will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates.\\\\nIn addition, Volvo started turning over the keys to initial customers of its Drive Me program. Its XC90 SUVs equipped with Drive PX2 are capable of fully autonomous operation on designated roads in Volvo\\'s hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. With NVIDIA\\'s powering the market\\'s only self-driving cars and partnerships with leading automakers, tier-one suppliers, and mapping companies, we feel very confident in our position as the transportation industry moves to autonomous vehicles.\\\\nNext, our OEM and IP business was $176 million, down 11% year on year.\\\\nNow turning to the rest of the income statement for Q4. Gross margins were at record levels, with GAAP gross margins at 60% and non-GAAP at 60.2%. These reflect the success of our platform approach, as well as strong demand for G-Force gaming GPUs and deep learning.\\\\nGAAP operating expenses were $570 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $498 million, up 12% from a year earlier, reflecting head-count-related costs for our AI growth initiatives, as well as investments in sales and marketing. We are investing into huge market opportunities: AI, self-driving cars, cloud computing, and gaming. Thus we expect our operating expense growth rate to be in the high teens over the next several quarters.\\\\nGAAP operating income was $733 million, and non GAAP operating income was $809 million. Both more than doubled from a year earlier. Our GAAP tax rate was 10%, and our non-GAAP was 13%. These rates were lower than expected, primarily due to a decrease in the amount of earnings subject to US tax. GAAP EPS was $0.99; non-GAAP EPS was $1.13.\\\\nIn FY17, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, in line with our intentions. For FY18, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\\\\nNow turning to the outlook for the first quarter of FY18, we expect revenue to be $1.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. At the mid-point, this represents 46% growth over the prior year. We expect data center to grow sequentially.\\\\nOur GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.5% and 59.7%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. This guidance assumes that our licensing agreement with Intel ends at March, and does not renew. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $603 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $520 million.\\\\nGAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $20 million, including additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $4 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of FY18 are both expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.\\\\nWith that I\\'m going to turn it back for the Operator so we can open up for questions. Please limit your questions to just one. Operator, let\\'s start with the questions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCertainly. Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J., your line is open.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nC.J. Muse,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCan you here me? Yes, my apologies, stuck on a plane here. Great results. I guess I was hoping to get a little more color on the data center side. Now that we\\'ve completed a full FY17, would love to get some clarity on the different moving parts and contributions there, then looking into FY18, how you see the growth unfolding thereafter? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, C.J. First of all, thanks a lot. Well, the single biggest mover would have to be data center. When you look back on last year and when you look forward, there\\'s a lot of reasons why data center business overall grew 3X, grew by a factor of three. I would expect that to happen, to continue.\\\\nThere\\'s several elements of our data center business. There\\'s the high-performance computing part, there\\'s the AI part; there\\'s grid, which is graphics virtualization; there\\'s the cloud computing, which is providing our GPU platform up in the cloud for start-ups and enterprises and all kinds of external customers to be able to access in the cloud, as well as a brand new AI super-computing appliance that we created last year, for anybody who would like to engage deep learning and AI, but don\\'t have the skills or don\\'t have the resources or don\\'t have the desire to build their own high-performance computing cluster. We integrated all of that with all of the complicated software stacks into an appliance that we maintain over the cloud. We call that DGX-1.\\\\nThese pieces -- AI, high-performance computing, cloud computing, grid, and DGX -- all in contribution contributed to our growth in data center quite substantially. My sense is that as we look forward to next year, we\\'re going to continue to see that major trend.\\\\nOf course, gaming was a very large and important factor, and my expectation is that gaming is going to continue to do that. Then longer term, our position in self-driving cars I think is becoming more and more clear to people over time. I expect that self-driving cars will be available on the road starting this year with early movers, and no later than 2020 for level four by the majors, and you might even see some of them pull into 2019. Those are some of the things we\\'re looking forward to.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks. I actually had one question for Jen-Hsun and one clarification for Colette. Jen-Hsun, where are we in the gaming cycle? It\\'s been very strong the last few years. What proportion of your base do you think has a credit to Pascal? Where does that usually peak before you launch your next-generation products?\\\\nThen for Colette, just inventory dollars and base ticked up. If you could give us some comment on that? Then on OpEx activity, you did a very good job last year, but this time you\\'re saying OpEx will go up mid-teens. Do you still think there is operating leverage in the model? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, let\\'s see. We typically assume that we have an installed base of $200 million G-Force gamers, and we\\'ve upgraded about two quarters of them -- as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. We started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. Our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Vivek. On your question on inventory, as you know, in many of our businesses we are still carrying significant architectures, and a broad list of different products for those architectures across. We feel comfortable with our level of inventory as we look forward into FY18 and our sales going forward.\\\\nYour second question was regarding OpEx, and comparing it to where we finished in 2017 and moving into FY18. We do have some great opportunities, large businesses for us to go capture the overall TAMs for, and we are going to be continuing to invest in the data center, specifically in AI, self-driving cars, as well as gaming. Rather than a focus on what the specific operating margin is, we\\'re going to focus primarily just on growing the overall TAM, and capturing that TAM on the top line.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis -- I apologize -- from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. Question back on the data center. The growth was impressive, and I\\'m wondering you mentioned that the hyper-scale players really have embraced the products first. I\\'m wondering if you could share with us to the extent that you think that they\\'re embracing it for their own use, or to the extent that they\\'re deploying it for services such as machine learning as a service and enterprises are really tapping into this, also, through the hyper-scale guys.\\\\nI\\'m wondering if you could help -- you mentioned that the enterprise is where you expect to see embracing the technology next in health care, retail, transport, finance. I\\'m wondering if you could share with us how you feel about that visibility, where you\\'re getting that visibility from? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOn hyper-scale, you\\'re absolutely right that there\\'s what we call internal use for deep learning, and then there\\'s the hosting GPU in the cloud for external high-performance computing use, which includes deep learning. Inside the hyper-scalers, the early adopters are moving obviously very fast, and -- but everybody has to follow. Deep learning has proven to be too effective. You guys -- everybody knows now that every hyper-scaler in the world is investing very heavily in deep learning. My expectation is that over the next coming years, deep learning and AI would become the essential tool by which they do their computing.\\\\nNow when they host it in the cloud, people on the cloud use it for a variety of applications. One of the reasons why the NVIDIA GPU is such a great platform is because of its broad utility. We\\'ve been working on GPU computing now for coming up on 12 years, and industry after industry, our GPU computing architecture has been embraced for high-performance computing, for data processing, for deep learning and such.\\\\nWhen somebody hosted up in the cloud -- for example, Amazon putting our GPUs up in the cloud -- that instance has the ability to do molecular dynamics to deep learning training to deep learning inferencing. Companies could use it for off-loading their computation, to start-ups being able to build their Company and build their application, and then host it for hundreds of millions of people to use. I think the hyper-scalers are going to continue to adopt GPU, both for internal consumption and cloud hosting for some time to come. We\\'re just in the beginning of that cycle, and that\\'s one of the reasons why we have a fair amount of enthusiasm around the growth here.\\\\nYou mentioned enterprise. Enterprise has all woken to the power of AI, and everybody understands that they have a treasure trove of data that they would like to find a way to discover insight from. In the case of real applications that we\\'re engaging now, you could just imagine that in the transportation industry, in car companies creating self-driving cars, one car company after another needs to take all of their road data and start to train their neuro-networks for their future self-driving cars. They use our DGX or Tesla GPUs to train the networks, which is then used to run their cars running on Drive PX. That\\'s one application example.\\\\nAnother application example, which is quite significant, it\\'s going to be the future of processing all of the HD maps in the world. You guys might have seen that we announced at GTC this API SDK called MapWorks. MapWorks takes video information, video information that is recorded from a car, and reconstructs the three-dimensional terrain information from that live video.\\\\nIt has to do computer vision, 3-D reconstruction, has to determine and detect where the lanes are, the signs are, the lights are, and even some interesting 3-D features, maybe buildings and curbs and such. It would do that automatically, and we need to process that for the world, for the planet. You could just imagine how much video is being recorded today, and how much data is being generated, and how much inferencing, computer vision, and 3-D reconstruction that has to be done, and our GPUs are really quite perfect for it.\\\\nMapWorks runs on top of our GPUs, and we\\'re working with just about every mapping company in the world today to adopt, MapWorks and to do HD processing for their maps. That\\'s another example.\\\\nMedical imaging companies all over the world have recognized the importance of deep learning in their ability to detect cancer and retinopathy, and the list of examples goes on and on. All the different modalities have now recognized the importance of deep learning, and you\\'re going to start to see one medical imaging company after another.\\\\nThe list of examples just keep on going. The fact of the matter is at this point, deep learning and AI has really become how future software development\\'s going to be done for a large number of industries, and that\\'s the enthusiasm we\\'re seeing around the world.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik,  Citigroup - Analyst    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, thanks for taking my question, and congratulations to the team on great results and guide. My first question is for Jen-Hsun. Jen-Hsun, on the adoption of VR for gaming, if I look at the price points of the headset and the PC, a little bit high for wider adoption. Could the use of GPU in the cloud like you guys are introducing with G-Force now be a way for the price points on VR to come down? Then I have a follow-up for Colette.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThe first year of VR has sold several hundred thousand units, and many hundreds of thousands of units. Our VR Works SDK, which allows us to process graphics in very low latency, dealing with all of the computer vision, processing, and whether it\\'s lens warping and such, has been -- has delivered really excellent results.\\\\nThe early VR is really targeted at early adopters. I think the focus of ensuring an excellent experience that surprises people, that delight people by Oculus and by Valve and by Epic and by Vive, by ourselves, by the industry, has really been a good focus. I think that we\\'ve delivered on the promise of a great experience.\\\\nThe thing that we have to do now is we have to make the headsets easier to use with fewer cables. We have to make it lighter, we have to make it cheaper. Those are all things that the industry\\'s working on. As the applications continue to come on line, you\\'re going to see that they\\'re going to meet themselves and find success. I think the experience is very clear that VR is exciting.\\\\nHowever, remember that we are also in the VR, we also brought VR to computer-aided design, and to professional applications. In this particular area, the cost is just simply not an issue. In fact, many of the applications previously were power walls or caves, VR caves, that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and now you could put that same experience if not even better on the desk of designers and creators.\\\\nI think that you\\'re going to find that creative use and professional use of VR is going to grow quite rapidly. Just recently we announced a brand new Quadro P5000 with VR, the world\\'s first VR notebook that went to market with HP and Dell, and they\\'re doing terrifically. I would think about VR in the context of both professional applications as well as consumer applications; but I think the first year was absolutely a great success.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRomit Shah,  Nomura Securities Company, Ltd. - Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thank you. First of all, congratulations on a strong FY17. If I may, Jen-Hsun, the revenue beat this quarter wasn\\'t as big as we\\'ve seen in the last several periods, and most of it came from data center. I totally understand that when your gaming business expands as much as it has it becomes harder to beat expectations by the same margin, but I was wondering if you could just spend some time talking about gaming demand, and how you think it was during the holiday season?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, the global PC gaming market is still vibrant and growing. The number of e-sports gamers around the world is growing. You guys know that Overwatch is a home run. Activision Blizzard\\'s Overwatch is raging all over Asia, and e-sports fans all over the world are picking it up. It\\'s graphically very intensive, without a 1050 class and above, it\\'s simply a non-starter. To really enjoy it, you need at least a 1060. This last quarter we launched a 1050 and a 1050 TI all over the world, and we\\'re seeing terrific success out of that.\\\\nMy expectation going into next year is that Overwatch is going to continue to spread all over the world. It really basically just started. It started in the west, and it\\'s now moving into the east, where the largest e-sports markets are. Overwatch is going to be a huge success. League of Legends is going to continue to be a huge success. My expectation is that the e-sports, along with AAA titles that are coming out this year, is going to keep PC gaming continuing to grow.\\\\nI quite frankly thought Q4 was pretty terrific. We had a record quarter, we had a record year. I don\\'t remember the last time that a large business the size of ours, and surely the size of a data center business, grew by factor of three. I think we\\'re in a great position going into next year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRaji Gill,  Needham & Company - Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thanks. Jen-Hsun, can you talk a little bit about the evolution of artificial intelligence, and make a distinction between artificial intelligence versus machine learning versus deep learning? They\\'re different kind of categorizations and implementations of those different sub-segments, so I wanted to get a sense from you how NVIDIA\\'s end-to-end computing platform dominates machine learning relative to say the competition? Then I have a question on the gross margins, if I could, as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, first of all, thanks for your question. The way to think about that is deep learning is a breakthrough technique in the category of machine learning, and machine learning is an essential tool to enable AI, to achieve AI. If a computer can\\'t learn, and if you can\\'t learn continuously and adapt with the environment, there\\'s no way to ever achieve artificial intelligence.\\\\nLearning, as you know, is a foundational part of intelligence. Deep learning is a breakthrough technique where the software can write software by itself, by learning from a large quantity of data. Prior to deep learning, other techniques like expert systems and role-based systems and hand-engineered features, where engineers would write algorithms to figure out how to detect at cat, and then the - they would figure out how to write another algorithm to detect a car. You could imagine how difficult that is, and how imperfect that is. It basically kind of works, but it doesn\\'t work good enough, well enough, to be useful. Then deep learning came along.\\\\nThe reason why deep learning took a long time to come along is because it\\'s singular handicap is that it requires an enormous amount of data to train the network, and it requires an enormous amount of computation. That\\'s why a lot of people credit the work that we\\'ve done with our programmable GPUs and our GPU computing platform, and the early collaboration with deep learning AI researchers as the Big Bang, if you will -- that catalyst that made modern AI possible. We made it possible to crunch through an enormous amount of data to train these very deep neuro networks.\\\\nThe reason why deep learning has just swept the world, it started with convolusion neuro networks, but reinforcement networks, and time sequence networks, and all kinds of interesting adversarial networks. The list of the types of networks -- there are 100 networks being created a week. Papers are coming out of everywhere. The reason why is because deep learning has proven to be quite robust. It is incredibly useful, and this tool has at the moment found no boundaries of problems that it\\'s figured out how to solve.\\\\nI think that the traditional methods of machine learning are still going to be useful if the absolute precision of the prediction or classification is not necessarily super-important. For example, if you wanted to understand the sentiment of consumers on a particular new product that you sent, whether the sentiment is exactly right, so long as you understand the basic trend and you largely understand the sentiment, I think people would consider that information to be useful.\\\\nHowever, if you\\'re using machine learning for cancer detection, obviously we need to have a level of precision that is quite high. Whether it\\'s in health care or financial services or high-performance computing, and in some areas where for example, ad-supported internet search, small differences in accuracy could make a very large difference in financial results for the advertiser, and for the people hosting the service. In all these cases, deep learning has found a great utility, and that\\'s one of the reasons why we\\'re seeing so much growth. Obviously for self-driving cars, being kind of right is not a good idea, and we like to be exactly right.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much. Jen-Hsun, you guys obviously have won some business with your automotive super-computer at Tesla in recent periods. I was curious if you could comment on some of the application porting and moving of features from the previous architecture on to your architecture, and how that\\'s gone, and what you guys have learned through that process, and how it might be applied to some of your future partnerships? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nFirst of all, you know that we are a full-stack platform. The way we think about all of our platforms is from the application all the way back to the fundamental architecture and the semiconductor device.\\\\nIn the case of Drive PX, we created the architecture, optimized for neural net, for sensor fusion, for high-speed processing; the semiconductor design, in the case of Drive PX2 called Parker, Tegra Parke; the system software for high-speed\\\\nsensor fusion and moving data all the way around the car -- the better you do that, the lower cost the system will be; the neural networks on top of that, that sits on top of our deep learning SDK, called KU DNN and Tensor RT, basically frameworks of AI; then on top of that, the actual algorithms for figuring out how to use that information from perception to localization to action planning.\\\\nThen on top of that, we have an API and an SDK that is integrated into map makers. We integrate into every single map, HD map service in the world, from HERE to TomTom to Zen Ren in Japan, to Baidu in China. This entire stack is a ton of software.\\\\nBut your question specifically has to do with the perception layer, and that perception layer quite frankly is just a small part of the self-driving car problem. The reason for that is because in the final analysis you want to detect lanes. You\\'ve got video coming in, you want to detect lanes. You have video coming in, you want to detect a car in front of you. All we have to do -- it\\'s not trivial, but it\\'s also not monumental -- we have to detect and sense the lanes and the cars, and we train our networks to do so.\\\\nAs you know very well now, the deep neural net has the ability to detect objects far better than any human-engineered computer vision algorithms prior to deep learning. That\\'s one of the reasons why Tesla and others have jumped on top of the deep learning approach, and abandoned traditional hand-featured computer vision approaches. Anyway, the answer to your question is that by working on self-driving cars end to end, we realized that this is much more than computer vision, that the self-driving car platform is a stack of software and algorithms that\\'s quite complex, and now we\\'ve had a lot of experience doing so.\\\\nThen recently at CES, we announced partnerships with Audi, which we announced that we will have level four self-driving cars on the road by 2020. We announced a partnership with Daimler, we announced a partnership with ZF and Bosch, two of the world\\'s top tier-one suppliers. We also announced partnerships with all of the mapping companies. If you put all that stuff together, we have the processor, we have the tier-one partnerships for the integration of the systems, we have all the software on top of it, the deep learning networks, the car partnerships, of course, and integrated into maps around the world. All that entire stack, when you put them all together, should allow us to have self-driving cars on the road.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat, thank you for taking the question. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the entrance market? Where are you in terms of hyper-scale adoption for specialized inference-type solutions, and how big do you think that market counts going to be? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, the inference market is going to be very large. It\\'s -- as you know very well, in the future almost every computing device will have inferencing on it. A thermostat will have inferencing on it, a bicycle lock will have inferencing on it, cameras will have inferencing on it, and self-driving cars would have a large amount of inferencing on it. Robots, vacuum cleaners, you name it, smart microphones, smart speakers, all the way into the data center. I believe that long term there will be a trillion devises that has inferencing connected to edge computing devices near them, connected to cloud computing devices, cloud computing servers. That\\'s basically architecture.\\\\nThe largest inferencing platform will likely be ARM devises. I think that goes without saying. ARM will likely be running inferencing networks, one bit [ex-nor], eight bit, and even some floating point. It just depends on what level of accuracy do you want to achieve, what level of perception do you want to achieve, and how fast you want to perceive it. The inferencing market is going to be quite large.\\\\nWe\\'re going to focus in markets where the inferencing precision, the inferencing -- the perception scenario, and the performance by which you have to do it, is mission critical. Of course self-driving cars is a perfect example of that. Robots, manufacturing robots will be another example of that. In the future, you\\'re going to see GTC -- if you had a chance to see that. We\\'re working with AI City partners all over the world for end-to-end video analytics. That requires very high throughput, a lot of computation. The examples go on and on, all the way back into the data center.\\\\nIn the data center, there\\'s several areas where inferencing is quite vital. I mentioned one earlier, just mapping the earth. Mapping the earth at the street level, mapping the earth in HD in three-dimensional level for self-driving cars, that process is going to require -- just a pile of GPUs running continuously as we continuously update the information that needs to be mapped.\\\\nThere\\'s an inferencing which is called off-line inferencing where you have to re-train a network after you\\'ve deployed it. You would likely re-train and re-categorize, re-classify the data using the same servers that you used for training. Even the training servers will be used for inferencing. Then lastly, all of the nodes in cloud will be inferencing nodes in the future. I\\'ve said before that I believe that every single node in the cloud data center will have inferencing capability and accelerated inferencing capability in the future, and I continue to believe that. These are all opportunities for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Wong from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHello, can you hear me?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, this is Toshiya from Goldman. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. I had a question on gross margins. I think you\\'re guiding Q1 gross margins only mildly below levels you saw in fiscal Q4, despite the royalty stream from Intel rolling over. I\\'m guessing improvement in mix and data center and parts of gaming are driving this, but A, is that the right way to think about the puts and takes going into Q1? B, if that is indeed the case, should we expect gross margins to edge higher in future quarters and future years as data center becomes a bigger percentage of your business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, this is Colette. Let me see if I can help answer that. You\\'re correct in terms of how to look at that in Q1. The delta from Q4 to Q1 is we only have a partial part of recognition from the Intel, and that stops in the middle of March. As we move forward, as well, going into Q2, we will also have the absence of what we had in Q1 moving to Q2. I\\'m not here to give guidance on Q2 because we just give guidance out one quarter, but keep that in mind. There\\'s a partial amount of Intel still left in Q1, and then it depletes in Q2.\\\\nIf you think about our overall model, our overall business model, it has moved to higher-end, value-added platforms, and that\\'s what we\\'re selling. Our goal is absolutely to continue to concentrate on providing those higher-value platforms. That gives us the opportunity for gross margin as we make those investments in terms of an OpEx. We\\'ll see what that kind of mix looks like as we go into Q2, but just to leave you with a understanding of Intel is probably what we can do here, okay?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStephen Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, thanks for taking my questions. First one is on the data center segment. Just given the expected sequential growth in that business here in the April quarter, can you talk about what products are helping to drove that? Is it possibly the DGX-1 computer box, or is it more GPUs for training purposes at the hyper-scale cloud data center?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIt would have to be Tesla processors using the cloud. There are several SKUs of Tesla processors. There\\'s the Tesla processors used for high-performance computing, and it has FP64, FP32, ECC. It\\'s designed. As Kuda of course and has been optimized for molecular dynamics, astrophysics, quantum chemistry, flow dynamics, the list goes on and on. The vast majority of the world\\'s high-performance super-computing applications, imaging applications, 3-D reconstruction applications, has been ported on to our GPUs over the course of the last decade in sum. That\\'s a very large part of our Tesla business.\\\\nThen of course we introduced on top of the architecture our deep learning stack. Our deep learning stack starts with KU DNN, the numerics kernels -- a lot of algorithms inside them to be optimized for numerical processing of all kinds of different precisions. It\\'s integrated into frameworks of different kinds. There\\'s so many different frameworks from Tensor RT to Cafe, to Torch to Tiano to MXNet, to CNTK; the work that we did with Microsoft, which is really excellent -- scaling it up from one GPU to many GPUs across multiple racks. That\\'s our deep learning stack, and that\\'s also very important.\\\\nThen the third is grid. Grid is a completely different stack. It\\'s the world\\'s first graphics virtualization stack, fully integrated into Citrix, integrated to VMware. Every single workstation and PC application has been verified, tested, and has the ability to be streamed from a data center.\\\\nThen last year, starting -- I think we announced it and we started shipping it in August -- our DGX-1, the world\\'s first AI super-computer appliance, which integrates a whole bunch more software of all different types, and has the ability to -- we introduced our first NVIDIA docker. It containerizes applications. It makes it possible for you to have a whole bunch of users use one DGX. They could all be running different frameworks because most environments are heterogeneous. That\\'s DGX-1, and it\\'s got an exciting pipeline ahead of it.\\\\nIt\\'s really designed for companies and work groups who don\\'t want to build their own super-computer like the hyper-scalers, and aren\\'t quite ready to move into the cloud because they have too much data to move to the cloud. Everybody basically can easily buy a DGX-1 that\\'s fully integrated, fully supported, and get to work on deep learning right away.\\\\nEach one of these are all part of our data center business, but the largest, because it\\'s been around the longest, is our Tesla business; but they\\'re all growing, every single one of them.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteve Smigie,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. - Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat, thanks a lot for the time. Just a quick question in the auto market. At CES, you had some solutions you were demonstrating that showed pretty significant declines in the size of what was being offered. You really shrunk it down a lot, yet still having great performance. If you think out to the level-four solution that you talk about for 2020, how small can you ultimately make that? It seems like you could be relative to the size of the car pretty small. Just curious if you would comment on that, and what impact having the system in the car makes on it?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWe currently have -- Drive PX today is a one-chip solution for level three. It can have -- and with two chips, two processors, you could achieve level four. With many processors, you could achieve level five today. Some people are using many processors to develop their level five, and some people are using a couple of processors to develop their level four.\\\\nOur next generation -- so that\\'s all based on a Pascal generation. Our next generation, the processor\\'s called Xavier. We announced that recently. Xavier basically takes four processors and shrink it into one. We\\'ll be able to achieve level four with one processor. That\\'s the easiest way to think about it. While achieve level three with one processor today, next year we\\'ll achieve level four with one processor, and with several processors, you could achieve level five.\\\\nI think that the number of processors is really interesting, because we need to do the processing of sensor fusion, and we\\'ve got to do perception, we have to do localization, we have to do driving. There\\'s a lot of functional safety aspects to it, fail over functionality, all kinds of black box recorders, all kinds of different functionality that goes into the processor. I think it\\'s really quite interesting.\\\\nIn the final analysis, what\\'s really hard -- and this is one of the reasons why our positioning in the autonomous driving market is becoming more and more clear -- is that in the final analysis, it\\'s really a software problem, and it\\'s an end-to-end software problem. It goes all the way from processing in the perception processing in the car, to AI processing to helping you drive, connected to HD clouds for HD map processing all over the world. This end-to-end stack of software is really quite a large undertaking.\\\\nI just don\\'t know where anybody else is currently doing that, with the exception of one or two companies. I think that\\'s really where the great complexity is. We have the ability to see and to optimize across the entire range.\\\\nNow the other thing that we announced at CS that\\'s worth mentioning is that we believe in the future, level four means that you will have autopilot capability, hands-free autopilot capability in many scenarios; however, it\\'s unlikely to ensure and to guarantee that in every scenario that you can achieve level four. It\\'s just not practical for some time.\\\\nHowever, during those circumstances, we believe that the car should still have an AI, that the car should be monitoring what\\'s happening outside, and it should be monitoring the driver. When it\\'s not driving for you, it\\'s looking out for you. We call that the AI co-pilot. Whereas AI autopilot achieves level four driving, AI co-pilot looks out for you in the event that it doesn\\'t have the confidence to drive on your behalf.\\\\nI believe that\\'s a really big breakthrough, and we\\'re just seeing incredible excitement about it around the industry, because I think it just makes a lot of sense. The combination of the two systems allows us to achieve or build a better car.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Ellis,  B. Riley & Company - Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for sneaking me in, and congratulations on the very good execution. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to come back to the gaming platform. You\\'ve now got the business running at a $5 billion annualized run rate, so congratulations on the growth there. I think investors look at that as a business that\\'s been built on the strength of a vibrant enthusiast market, but at CES, you announced the G-Force Now offering, which really allows you to tap into the more casual potential gamer. The question is, what will G-Force now do incrementally for the opportunity that you have with your gaming platform?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, appreciate that. I think first of all, the PC gaming market is growing because of a dynamic that nobody ever expected -- a dynamic that nobody ever expected 20 years ago. That\\'s basically how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport. Not only is it a sport, it\\'s a social sport. In order to play some of these modern e-sports games, it\\'s a five on five, so you kind of need four other friends. As a result, in order to enjoy, to be part of this phenomenon that\\'s sweeping the world, that it\\'s rather sticky.\\\\nThat\\'s one of the reasons why Activision Blizzard\\'s doing so well. That\\'s one of the reasons why Tensen\\'s doing so well. These two companies have benefited from tremendously from the e-sport dynamic, and we\\'re seeing it all over the world. Although it\\'s free to play for some people, of course you need to have a reasonably good computer to run it, and that\\'s one of the reasons why you need G-Force in your PC, so that you can enjoy these sports.\\\\nWhen it\\'s also a sport, nobody likes to lose, and surely nobody likes to blame their equipment when they do lose. Having G-Force allows -- gives you confidence and gives you an edge. For a lot of gamers, it\\'s just a world standard.\\\\nI think that number one, e-sport is one of the reasons why gaming continues to grow. I think at this point it\\'s fair to say that even though it\\'s now the second most watched spectator sport on the planet behind Super Bowl, it is also the second highest paid winning sport behind football. It is -- it will soon be the largest sport in the world. I can\\'t imagine too many young people long term not coming into the sport somehow, as this sport continues to expand in genres. That\\'s one of the core reasons.\\\\nNow aside for -- you asked the question about G-Force Now, which I really appreciate. The simple way to think about that is this. There are many computers in the world that simply don\\'t have the ability to enjoy video games, whether it\\'s extremely thin and light notebooks, Apple Macs, ChromeBooks, the integrated graphics that don\\'t have very good capabilities. I think that it\\'s the reasonable thing to do is to put the technology in the cloud. It took us some five years to make this possible, to put the technology in the cloud and stream the video game experience with very low latency to the computer, like Netflix does. We\\'re basically turning the PC into a virtualized gaming experience, and putting that in the cloud.\\\\nI don\\'t know exactly how big it\\'s going to be yet, but our aspiration is that we would reach the parts of the market where they\\'re casual, or they just want to have another way, another device where they can game, or somebody would like to come into the gaming world and isn\\'t quite ready to invest the time in building a computer or buying into a G-Force PC yet. I\\'m anxious to learn from it. When I learn more about G-Force Now, I\\'ll be more than happy to share it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nUnfortunately, that is all the time we have for questions. Do you have any closing remarks?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI want to thank all of you guys for following us. We had a record year, a record quarter, and most importantly, we\\'re at the beginning of the AI computing revolution. This is a new form of computing, a new way of computing, where parallel data processing is vital to success and GPU computing that we\\'ve been nurturing for the last decade in sum is really the perfect computing approach.\\\\nWe\\'re seeing tremendous growth and exciting growth in the data center market. Data center now represents -- had grew at 3X over year over year, and it\\'s on its way to become a very significant business for us. Gaming is a significant business for us, and longer term, self-driving cars is going to be a really exciting growth opportunity.\\\\nThe thing that has really changed about our Company, what really defines how our Company goes to market today is really the platform approach, that instead of just building a chip that is industry standard, we created software stacks on top of it to serve vertical markets that we believe will be exciting long term that we can serve. We find ourselves incredibly well-positioned now in gaming, in AI, and in self-driving cars. I want to thank all of you guys for following NVIDIA, and have a great year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis concludes today\\'s conference call.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Simona. Q2 was another extraordinary quarter. The world continued to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of our employees continued to work from home. But through the team\\'s agility and dedication, we successfully combined Mellanox into NVIDIA while also delivering a very strong quarter. revenue was $3.87 billion, up 50% year-on-year, up 26% sequentially and well ahead of our outlook. \\\\nStarting with gaming. Revenue was $1.65 billion, was up 26% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially, significantly ahead of our expectations. The upside is broad-based across geographic regions, products and channels. Gaming\\'s growth amid the pandemic highlights the emergence of a leading form of entertainment worldwide. For example, the number of daily gamers on Steam, a leading PC game online distributor is up 25% from pre-pandemic levels. And NPD reported that U.S. consumer spending on video games grew 30% in the second calendar quarter to a record $11 billion. \\\\nNVIDIA\\'s PCs and laptops are ideal for the millions of people who are now working, learning and gaming at home. At the outset of the pandemic, many retail outlets were closed, and demand shifted to online channels. As the quarter progressed and the stores reopened, retail demand picked up, iCafes largely reopened and online sales continued to thrive. Gaming laptop demand is very strong as students and professionals turn to GeForce-based systems to improve how they work, learn and game from home. We ramped over 100 new models with our OEM partners, focused on both premium and mainstream price points. \\\\nIn the premium laptop segment, we delivered unparalleled performance with the GeForce RTX 2080 and the 2070 SUPER GPUs InfiniBand form factors. We also brought ray tracing to gaming laptops for the first time at price points as low as $999 with the GeForce RTX 2060. In the mainstream segment, we brought the GeForce GTX to laptop price points as low as $699. \\\\nMomentum continues for our Turing architecture, which enables stunning new visual effects in games and is driving powerful upgrade cycle among gamers. Its RTX technology adds ray tracing and AI to programmable shading and has quickly redefined the new standard for computer graphics. DLSS used the AI capabilities of Turing to boost frame rates by almost 2x while generating crisp image quality. RTX support in blockbuster games continues to grow, including megahit Death Stranding, the high anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 and the upcoming release of Watch Dogs. These games join Minecraft and other major titles that support NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and DLSS. \\\\nWe\\'re in the midst of a 21-day countdown campaign, promoting a GeForce special event on September 1, with each day highlighting a year in the history of GeForce. We don\\'t want to spoil the surprise, but we encourage you to tune in. We are very pleased with the traction of our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service, now in its second quarter of commercially availability. GFN offers the richest content to any game streaming service through partnerships with leading digital game stores, including Valve Steam, Epic Games and Ubisoft Uplay. GeForce NOW enables users with underpowered PC, Macs or Android devices to access powerful GPUs to play their libraries of PC games in the cloud, expanding the universe of gamers that we can reach with GeForce. \\\\nJust yesterday, we announced that GFN is now supported on Chromebooks, further expanding our reach in to tens of millions of users. In addition to NVIDIA\\'s own service, GFN is available or coming soon to a number of telecom partners around the world, including SoftBank and KDDI DION in Japan, Rostelecom and Beeline in Russia, LG U+ in South Korea and Taiwan Mobile. \\\\nMoving to Pro Viz. In Q2 was $203 million in revenue, down 30% year-on-year and down 34% sequentially, with declines in both mobile and desktop workstations. Sales were hurt by lower enterprise demand amid the closure of many offices around the world. Industries negatively impact during the quarter include automotive, architectural, engineering and construction, manufacturing, media and entertainment and oil and gas. Initiatives by enterprises to enable remote workers drove demand for virtual and cloud-based graphic solutions. Accordingly, our Q2 vGPU bookings accelerated, increasing 60% year-on-year. \\\\nDespite near-term challenges, we are winning new business in areas such as health care, including Siemens, Philips and General Electric, and the public sector. We continue to expand our market opportunity with over 50 leading design and creative applications that are NVIDIA RTX-enabled, including the latest release from Foundry, Chaos Group and Maxon. These applications provide faster ray tracing and accelerated performance, improving creators design workflows. The pandemic will have a lasting impact on how we work. Our revenue mix going forward will likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as NVIDIA laptops and virtual workstations, that enable remote work and virtual collaboration. \\\\nMoving to automotive. Automotive revenue was $111 million, down 47% year-on-year and down 28% sequentially. This was slightly better than our outlook of a 40% sequential decline as the impact of the pandemic was less pronounced than expected, with auto production volumes starting to recover after bottoming in April. Some of the decline is also due to the roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue, which remained a headwind in future quarters. \\\\nIn June, we announced a landmark partnership with Mercedes-Benz which, starting in 2024, will launch software-defined intelligent vehicles across an entire fleet in using end-to-end NVIDIA technology. Mercedes will utilize NVIDIA\\'s full technology stack, including the DRIVE AGX computer, DRIVE AV autonomous driving software and NVIDIA\\'s AI infrastructure, spanning from the core to the cloud. Centralizing and unifying computing in the car will make it easier to integrate and upgrade advanced software features as they are developed. With over-the-air updates, vehicles can receive the latest autonomous driving and intelligent cockpit features, increasing value and extending majority of ownership with each software upgrade. This is a transformative announcement for the automotive industry, making the turning point of traditional vehicles becoming high-performance, updatable data centers on wheels. It\\'s also a transformative announcement for NVIDIA\\'s to evolving business model as the software content of our platforms grows, positioning us to build a recurring revenue stream. \\\\nMoving to data center. Data center is diverse, consist of cloud service providers, public cloud providers, supercomputing centers, enterprises, telecom and industrial edge. Q2 revenue was a record $1.75 billion, up 167% year-on-year and up 54% sequentially. In Q2, we incorporated a full quarter of contribution from the Mellanox acquisition, which closed on April 27, the first day of our quarter. Non-ops contributed approximately 14% of company revenue and just over 30% of data center revenue. Both compute and networking within data center set a record with accelerating year-on-year growth. \\\\nThe biggest news in data center this quarter was the launch of our Ampere architecture. We are very proud of the team\\'s execution in launching and ramping this technological marvel, especially amid the pandemic. The A100 is the largest chip ever made with 54 billion transistors. It runs our full software stack for accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads. Our software leases include CUDA 11, the new versions of over 50 CUDA-X libraries and a new application frameworks for major AI workloads, such as Jarvis for conversational AI and Merlin for deep recommender systems. The A100 delivers NVIDIA\\'s greatest generational leap ever, boosting AI performance by 20x over its predecessor. It is also our first universal accelerator, unifying AI training and inference and powering workloads, such as data analytics, scientific computing, genomics, edge video analytics, 5G services and graphics. \\\\nThe first Ampere GPU, A100, has been widely adopted by all major server vendors and cloud service providers. Google Cloud Platform was the first cloud customer to bring it to market, making it the fastest GPU to come to the cloud in our history. And just this morning, Microsoft Azure announced the availability of massively scalable AI clusters, which are based on the A100, and interconnected with 200 gigabyte per second Mellanox InfiniBand networking. A100 is also getting incorporated into offerings from AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Baidu Cloud and Tencent Cloud. And we announced that the A100 is going to market with more than 50 servers from leading vendors around the world, including Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo. Adoption of the A100 into leading server makers offerings is faster than any prior launch, with 30 systems expected this summer and over 20 more by the end of the year. \\\\nThe A100 is already winning industry recognition. In the latest A100 training benchmark, MLPerf 0.7, NVIDIA set 16 records, sweeping all categories for commercially available solutions in both per chip and outscale performance based on the A100. MLPerf offers the industry\\'s first and only objective AI benchmark. Since the benchmark was introduced 2 years ago, NVIDIA has consistently delivered leading results and record performance for both training and inference. NVIDIA also topped the chart in the latest top 500 list of the fastest supercomputers. The ranking, released in June, showed that 8 of the world\\'s top 10 supercomputers use NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA networking or both. They include the most powerful systems in the U.S. and Europe. NVIDIA, now combined with Mellanox, powers 2/3 of the top 500 systems on the list compared with just less than a half for the 2 companies in total 2 years ago. \\\\nIn energy efficiencies, systems using NVIDIA GPUs are pulling away from the pack. On average, they are nearly 2.8x more powerful and efficient than systems without NVIDIA GPUs, measured by gigaflops per watt. The incredible performance and efficiency of the A100 GPU is best amplified by NVIDIA\\'s own new Selene supercomputer, which debuted as #7 on the top 500 list and is the only top 100 systems to cross the 20 gigaflops per watt barrier. Our engineers were able to assemble Selene in less than 4 weeks using NVIDIA\\'s open modular DGX SuperPOD reference architecture instead of the typical build time of months or even years. This is the system that we will use to win the MLPerf benchmarks, and it is a reference design. It\\'s available for our customers to quickly build a world-class supercomputer. \\\\nWe also brought GPU acceleration to data analytics, one of the largest and fastest-growing enterprise workload. We enabled an acceleration of the entire data analytics workload pipeline for the first time with NVIDIA\\'s GPUs and software stack in the latest version of Apache Spark released in June. Spark is the world\\'s leading data analytics platform used by more than 500,000 data scientists and 16,000 enterprises worldwide. \\\\nAnd we have 2 major milestones to share. We have now shipped a cumulative total of 1 billion CUDA GPUs, and the total number of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem just reached 2 million. It took over a decade to reach the first million and less than 2 years to reach the second million. Mellanox has fantastic results across the board in its first quarter as part of NVIDIA. Mellanox revenue growth accelerated with strength across Ethernet and InfiniBand products. Our Ethernet shipments reached a new record. Major hyperscale build drove the upside in the quarter as growth in cloud computing and AI is fueling increased demand for high-performance networking. Mellanox networking was a critical part of several of our major new product introductions this quarter. These include the DGX AI system, the DGX SuperPOD clusters for our Selene supercomputer and the EGX Edge AI platform. We also launched the Mellanox ConnectX-6 Ethernet NIC, the 11th generation product of the ConnectX family, and it\\'s designed to meet the needs of modern cloud and hyperscale data centers, where 25, 50 and 100 gigabyte per second is becoming the standard. \\\\nWe expanded our switch networking capabilities with the addition of Cumulus Networks, a privately held network software company that we purchased in June. Cumulus augments our Mellanox acquisition in building out open modern data center. The combination of NVIDIA accelerated computing, Mellanox networking and Cumulus software enables data centers that are accelerated, disaggregated and software-defined to meet the exponential growth in AI, cloud and high-performance computing. \\\\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margin was 58.8% and non-GAAP gross margin was 66%. GAAP gross margin declined year-on-year and sequentially due to costs associated with the Mellanox acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margins increased by almost 6 points year-on-year, reflecting a shift in product mix with higher data center sales and lower automotive sales. Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $1.62 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.04 billion, up 67% and 38% from a year ago, respectively. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.99, up 10% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 76% from a year ago. Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.57 billion. \\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We expect revenue to be $4.4 billion, plus or minus 2%. With that, we expect gaming to be up just over 25% sequentially with data center to be up in the low to mid-single digits sequentially. We expect both pro viz and the auto to be at similar levels out in Q2. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.5% and 65.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.54 billion and $1.09 billion, respectively. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP OpEx is tracking in line with our outlook of $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be expense of approximately $55 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $225 million to $250 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. \\\\nIn closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the BMO Virtual Technology Summit on August 25, Citi\\'s 2020 Global Technology Conference on September 9, Deutsche Bank\\'s Technology Conference on September 14 and the Evercore\\'s Virtual Memo Forum, The Future of Mobility, on September 21. We will also host a financial analyst Q&A with Jensen on October 5 as part of our next virtual GTC. Our earnings call to discuss our third quarter\\'s results is scheduled for Wednesday, November 18. \\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCongratulations on the strong growth and execution. Jensen, I\\'m wondering how much of the strength that you\\'re seeing in gaming and data center is maybe more temporary because COVID or some customer pull-ins in the data center or so forth? And how much of it is more structural and more secular that can continue even once we get into, hopefully, sooner rather than later, into a more normalized period for the industry?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Vivek, thank you. So first of all, we didn\\'t see pull-ins, and we\\'re in the beginning of our brand-new product cycle with Ampere. And so the vast majority of the data center growth came from that. The gaming industry, they -- with all that\\'s happening around the world, and it\\'s really unfortunate, but it\\'s made gaming the largest entertainment medium in the world. More than ever, people are spending time digitally, spending on time -- spending their time in video games. The thing that people haven\\'t realized about video games is that it\\'s not just the game itself anymore. The variety of different ways that you can play, whether you can hang out with your friends in Fortnite, go to a concert in Fortnite, building virtual worlds in Minecraft, you\\'re spending time with your friends, you\\'re using it to create -- to realize your imaginations. \\\\nPeople are using it for broadcast, for sharing ideas and techniques with other people, and so -- and then of course, it\\'s just an incredibly fun way to spend time even by consumption of the video -- of a video game. And so there\\'s just so much that you could do with video games now. And I think that this way of enjoying entertainment digitally has been accelerated as a result of the pandemic, but I don\\'t think it\\'s going to return. Video game adoption has been going up over time and pretty steadily. PC is now the single largest entertainment platform -- is the largest gaming platform. And GeForce is now the largest gaming platform in the world. And as I mentioned, it\\'s not just about gaming. There\\'s just so many different ways that you could enjoy games. \\\\nWith data center, the thing that -- the structural change that\\'s happening in data center are a couple of different dynamics that are happening at the same time. The first dynamic, of course, is the movement to the cloud. The way that a cloud data center is built and the way that an enterprise data center or a cluster is built is fundamentally different. And it\\'s really, really beneficial to have the ability to accelerate applications that cloud service providers would like to offer, which is basically everything. And we know that one of the most important applications of today is artificial intelligence. It\\'s a type of software that really wants acceleration, and NVIDIA\\'s GPU acceleration is the perfect medium, perfect platform for it.\\\\nAnd then the last reason about the data center is the architectural change from hosting applications to hosting services that\\'s driving this new type of architecture called disaggregation versus hyper converged. And the original name of hyperscalers is a large data center of a whole bunch of hyperconverged computers. But the computers of today are really disaggregated. A single application service could be running on multiple servers at the same time, which generates a ton of east-west traffic, and a lot of it is artificial intelligence neuro network models. \\\\nAnd so because of this type of architecture, 2 components, 2 types of technologies are really important to the future of cloud. One of them, as I mentioned, was -- is acceleration, and our GPU is ideal for it. And then the other one is high-speed networking. And the reason for that is because the server is now disaggregated, the application is fractionalized and broken up into a bunch of small pieces that are running across the data center. And whenever an application needs to send parts of the answer to another server for the microservice to run, that transmission is called east-west traffic, and the most important thing you could possibly do for yourself is to buy really high-speed, low-latency networking. And that\\'s what Mellanox is fantastic at. \\\\nAnd so we find ourselves really in this perfect condition where the future is going to be more virtual, more digital, and that\\'s one -- that\\'s the reason why GeForce is so successful. And then we find ourselves in a world where the future is going to be more autonomous and more AI-driven, and that\\'s the benefit of our GPUs. \\\\nAnd then lastly, cloud microservice transactions really benefit high-speed networking, and that\\'s where Mellanox comes in. And so I think that this is -- the dynamics that I\\'m describing are permanent, and it\\'s just been accelerated to the present because of everything that\\'s happening to us. But this is the future, and it\\'s not -- there\\'s no going back, and we just found everything accelerated.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen, I guess I had a question on both architecture and also manufacturing. And I think on the manufacturing side, you\\'ve been radical now for some time. And when you\\'ve been asked in the past about moving to more of a tiled or chiplet approach, you sort of made light of that. But the CPU guys are clearly taking that approach. So I guess the question is, why do you think you won\\'t have to make a similar move? And then on the side of architecture, the theme of Hot Chips this week was really how compute demand is far outstripping computing power? And then we see this talk about you and ARM. So I guess can you talk about whether GPU is the future and maybe the broader opportunity to integrate CPU and GPU?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. We push architecture really hard. And the way we push architecture is we start from the system, but we believe that the future computer company is a data center-scale company. The computing unit is no longer a microprocessor or even a server or even a cluster. The computing unit is an entire data center now. And as I was explaining to Vivek just now that a microservice that we\\'re enjoying hundreds of billions of transactions a day, those are broken up into a whole bunch of microservices that are running across the entire data center. \\\\nAnd so the data center is running -- the entire data center is running an application. I mean that\\'s pretty remarkable thing, and that\\'s happened in the last several years. We were ahead of this trend, and we recognized that as a computing company, we have to be a data center-scale company, and we architect from that starting. If you look at our architecture, we were the first in the world to create the concept of an NVLink with 8 processors being fully synchronized across a computing node, and we created the DGX. \\\\nWe recognize the importance of high-speed networking and low-latency networking, and that\\'s why we bought Mellanox. And the amount of software that we invented along the way to make it possible for low-latency communications, whether it\\'s GPUDirect or recently the invention of GPUDirect Storage, all of that technology was inspired by the idea that you have to think about the data center all-in-one holistic way. \\\\nAnd then in the last -- in this current generation with Ampere, we invented the world\\'s first multi-instance GPU. We invented the world\\'s first multi-instance GPU, which means that our Ampere GPU could simultaneously be 1 GPU or, with NVlink, 8 GPUs combined, working together, so you could think of them as being tiled. So those 8 GPUs are working harmoniously together. Or each one of the GPUs could fractionalize itself, if you don\\'t need that much GPU working on your workload, fractionalize into a multi-GPU instance, we call the MIG, a little tiny instance. And each one of those tiny instances are more powerful and more performant than our entire Volta GPU lap time. And so whether you like to fractionalize the GPU, which happens oftentimes; create a larger GPU using NVLink; or create an even larger GPU, the size of DGX POD, connected together with high-speed, low-latency networking with Mellanox, we could architect it any way you\\'d like. \\\\nYou made a comment about -- you asked a question about ARM. We\\'ve been a long-term partner of ARM, and we use ARM in a whole bunch of applications. And whether it\\'s autonomous driving or a robotics application, the Nintendo Switch, console business that we\\'re in. And then recently, we brought CUDA to ARM and to bring accelerated computing to ARM. And so we worked with the ARM team very closely. They\\'re really great guys. And one of the specials about the ARM architecture that you know very well is that it\\'s incredibly energy-efficient. And because it\\'s energy-efficient, it has the headroom to scale into very high-performance levels over time. And so anyways, we love working with the ARM guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCongratulations on the quarter. Just building on some prior questions. The first one, I was just curious if you could help us appreciate kind of the installed base of the gaming GPU business relative to where we\\'re at the Turing upgrade cycle. What do we see still on prior generations, be it Pascal or before? And then secondly, I was wondering, Colette, could you just give me a kind of updated commentary or views on visibility in the data center business? How has that changed over the last 3 months? What does that look like as you look through the back half of the calendar year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Thanks a lot, Aaron. We are -- we\\'re still in the ramping of the RTX generation. Turing, Turing the current generation that we\\'re in, is the world\\'s first ray tracing GPU. And it fuses -- the RTX technology fuses 3 fundamental technologies: the programmable shader that we introduced a long time ago that revolutionized computer graphics; and we added 2 new technologies. One technology is a ray tracing acceleration core that makes the tracing of rays and looking for intersections between the ray and the scene -- objects in the scene super, super fast. And that -- it\\'s a complicated problem. It\\'s a super-complicated problem. We want it to be running concurrently to shading so that the ray traversal and the shading of the pixels could be done independently and concurrently. \\\\nThe second thing is we invented this technology to bring AI, artificial intelligence, using this new type of algorithm called deep learning to computer graphics. And one example of its capability is the algorithm we introduced called DLSS, Deep Learning Super Sampling, which allows us to essentially synthesize by learning from previous examples, essentially learning from previous examples of images and remembering it, remembering what beautiful images look like so that when you take a low-resolution image, and you run it through the deep neural network, it synthesizes a high-resolution image that\\'s really, really beautiful. And people have commented that it\\'s even more beautiful than native rendered images at the native resolution. And the benefit is not only is it beautiful, it\\'s also super fast. We essentially nearly doubled the performance of RTX as a result of doing that. So you can have the benefit of ray tracing as well as very high resolution and very high speed. And so that\\'s called RTX. \\\\nAnd Turing is probably not even close, not even 1/3 of the total installed base of all of our GeForce GPUS, which is, as you know, the single-largest installed base of gaming platforms in the world. And so we support this large installed base, and we\\'re in the process of bringing them to the future with RTX. And now with the new console generation coming, every single game developer on the planet is going to be doing ray tracing, and they\\'re going to be creating much, much richer content. And because of multi-platform, cross-platform play and because of the size of the gaming platform, PC gaming platform, it\\'s really important that these game developers bring the latest generation content to PCs, which is great for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd then on the data center visibility?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Let me see if I can answer this one for you. Yes, we have been talking about our visibility of data center. And as you\\'ve seen in our Q2 results, you can see that our overall adoption of the NVIDIA computing portfolio has accelerated quite nicely. But keep in mind, we\\'re still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It\\'s ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than 1/4 of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow. \\\\nWe have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy. On-premises are challenged because of the overall COVID. But remember, industries are quickly and continuing to adopt and move to the overall cloud. But overall, we do expect a very strong Q3.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI guess 2 questions. If I look at your outstanding inventory purchase obligations, grew, I think, 17% sequentially. Is that as you prepare for the September 1 launch? And can you kind of comment on gaming visibility into the back half of the year? And then the second question, Jensen, I know you\\'re very focused on platforms and driving recurring revenues. Would love to hear if there\\'s any particular platforms over the last 3 months where you\\'ve made real headway or get you excited, whether Jarvis, Merlin, Spark or whatever.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Thanks so much, C.J. We\\'re expecting a really strong second half for gaming. I think this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever. And the reason for that is because PC gaming has become such a large format. The combination of amazing games like Fortnite and Minecraft and because of the way people game now, their gaming and their e-sporting, even F1 is an e-sport now. They\\'re hanging out with friends. They\\'re using it to create other content. They\\'re using game captures, create art. They\\'re sharing it with the community. It\\'s a broadcast medium. The number of different ways you could game has just really, really exploded. And it works on PCs because all the things that I described require cameras or keyboards or streaming systems or -- and -- but it requires an open system that is multitasking. And so the PC has just become such a large platform for gaming. \\\\nAnd the second thing is that RTX, it\\'s a home run. We really raised the bar with computer graphics, and the games are so beautiful, and it\\'s really, really the next level. It\\'s not been this amazing since we introduced programmable shaders about 15 years ago. And so for the last 15 years, we\\'ve been making programmable shaders better and better and better, and it has been getting better. But there\\'s never been a giant leap like this, and RTX brought both artificial intelligence as well as ray tracing to PC gaming. \\\\nAnd then the third factor is the console launch. There\\'s -- people are really -- the game developers are really gearing up for a big leap. And because of the gaming -- because how vibrant the gaming market is right now and how many people around the world is depending on gaming at home. I think it\\'s going to be the most amazing season ever. We\\'re already seeing amazing numbers from our console partner, Nintendo. Switch has -- about to sell more than Super Nintendo, more than all the Famicom, which was one of the best gaming consoles of all time. I mean they\\'re underway to make Switch the most successful gaming platform of all time. And so I\\'m super excited for them. And so I think it\\'s going to be quite a huge second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette, I felt like I didn\\'t -- I missed C.J.\\'s second question. Can we jump on and answer it?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think the question was regarding our inventory purchases on that piece. Is that the part that you\\'re referring to?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. That\\'s the one. Yes.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Keep in mind, C.J., that when you think about the complexity of the products that we are building, we have extremely long lead times, both in terms of what we produce for the data center, our full systems that we need to do as well as what you are seeing now between the sequential growth between Q2 and Q3 for overall gaming. So all of that is in preparation for the second half. Nothing unusual about it other than, yes, we\\'ve got to hit those revenue numbers that are in our Q3 guidance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman and Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI had one for Jensen and another one for Colette. Jensen, just following up on the data center business. As you probably know, quite a few of your peers have been talking about potential digestion of capacity on the part of your hyperscale customers over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months. Curious, is that something that you think about, worry about in your data center business? Or do you have enough idiosyncratic growth drivers like the A100 ramp? And I guess the breadth that you\\'ve built within your data center business across compute and networking, are those enough for you to buck the trend within data center over the next 6 to 12 months? \\\\nAnd then the second one for Colette, just on gross margins. You\\'re guiding October quarter gross margins down 50 basis points sequentially. Based on the color that you provided for the individual segments, it looks like mix remains pretty positive. So just curious what\\'s driving the marginal decline in gross margins in the October quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Thank you. So thanks for the question. The -- our data center trend is really tied to a few factors. One is the proliferation of using deep learning and artificial intelligence and all the services that are in -- by the cloud service providers. And I think it\\'s fair to say that over the last several years, the number of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been really terrific. And we\\'re seeing anywhere from 10x, 10x more computational requirement each year to more than that. And so in the last 3 years, we\\'ve seen somewhere between 1,000 to 3,000x increase in the size of models, the computational requirement necessary to create these AI models and to deploy these AI models. \\\\nAnd so the #1 trend that we\\'re probably indexed to is the breakthroughs of AI and the usefulness of AI and how people are using it. And one of the -- and I remember C.J.\\'s question now, and I\\'ll answer this along with that. One of the things that we look for and you should look for is how -- what kind of breakthroughs are based on deep learning and based on AI that these services all demand.\\\\nAnd there are 3 big ones, just gigantic one. Of course, one of them is natural language understanding, the ability to take a very complicated text and use deep learning to create essentially a dimension reduction, it\\'s called deep embedding, dimension reduction on that body of text so that you could use that vector as a way to teach a recommender system, which is the second major breakthrough, the recommender system, how to predict and make a recommendation to somebody. Recommendation on ads and videos, and there are trillions of videos on the web. You need ways to recommend them, both the news and just the amount of information that is going to -- that is in true dynamic form require these recommenders to be instantaneous.\\\\nAnd so the first one is natural language understanding. The second one is the recommender system, gigantic breakthroughs in the last several years. And the third is conversational AI. I mean we\\'re going to have conversational engines that are just super clever, and they can predict what you\\'re about to ask. They\\'re going to predict the right answer for you, make recommendations to you based on the 3 pillars that I just described. \\\\nAnd I haven\\'t even started talking about robotics, the breakthroughs that are happening there with all the factories that need to automate and breakthroughs that we\\'re seeing in self-driving cars, the models there are really improving fast. And so the answer to you, Toshiya, and C.J. are kind of similar, that on the first one, we\\'re indexed to AI. The second, we\\'re indexed to breakthroughs of AI. So that it can continue to consume more and more capability and more technology. \\\\nAnd then the third thing that we\\'re indexed to is the movement of workloads to the cloud. It is now possible to do rendering in the cloud, remote graphics workstations in the cloud. And NVIDIA virtual workstations is in every single cloud. You could do big data analytics in the cloud. And these applications, I\\'ve just given you a few applications where you can do scientific computing in the cloud. These applications all have fundamentally different computing architectures. \\\\nNVIDIA is the only accelerated architecture that allows you to do microservices for conversational AI and other types of AI applications to scale up applications like high-performance computing, training, big data analytics to virtualize applications like workstations. Our platform is universal, and these 3 facets that I just described are supremely complex, virtualized, microservices-based and scale-up-based. And so these -- bare metal scale-up. And these are complicated, and it\\'s one of the reasons why we bought Mellanox because they\\'re at the core and at the intersection of all of that. The storage, the networking, the security, the virtualization, they\\'re at the intersection of all of that. And I just described 3 dynamics that are very, very powerful and are at the early stages yet. And so those are the things that we\\'re really indexed to. \\\\nAnd then lastly, when somebody adopts -- when we introduce a new platform like Ampere, we\\'re in the beginning of a multiyear product cycle, Ampere is such a gigantic breakthrough. It\\'s the first universal GPU we ever created. It is both able to scale up as well as scale out, scale up as in multi GPUs, scale out is fractionalization, multi-instance GPUs. And it\\'s -- it reduced -- it saves money, tremendous amount of money for people who use it. It speeds up their application. It reduces their TCO. Their TCO value just goes through the roof. And so we\\'re in the beginning of this multiyear cycle and the enthusiasm has been fantastic. This is the fastest ramp we\\'ve ever had. And so we\\'re going to keep on racing through the second half.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. And Toshiya, you asked a question regarding our guidance going forward regarding gross margin. And within our Q3 guidance, we have just a small decline in our gross margin from Q2. Most of that is really associated with mix but also a little bit in terms of the ramping of our new Ampere architecture products that we have. So keep in mind, our data center will likely be a lower percentage of total revenue, given the strong overall gaming growth that we expect between Q2 and Q3. Within that gaming growth, keep in mind, consoles are also included, which will continue to be below our company totals average gross margin, and that is expected to be up strongly quarter-over-quarter for our overall console shipments. We\\'re going to be ramping those new architectures over time when we have the ability to expand our gross margin as Ampere GPUs mature, too.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI wanted to dig into data center a little bit. This is a question for Colette. So in the quarter, ex Mellanox, data center was up, core data center, maybe 6%, 7%. The guide looks to be roughly similar to that into Q3. Can you talk to us a little bit about what\\'s driving the trajectory? Are you more demand or more supply limited at this point? What does your supply situation look like? And what are the lead times especially on the A100 products for data center look like at this point? Like if you have more capacity available, do you think you\\'d have like a stronger trajectory than you have right now?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. Stacy, so thanks for the question. Let me first start on our Q3 outlook and what we\\'re seeing. And when we think about our demand and our supply, we\\'re very comfortable with the supply that we have. Keep in mind, our products are quite complex, and a lot of our time is spent in terms of procuring every aspect of that supply over multiple quarters previously. So that\\'s how we work. But we are very confident with the overall supply that we have across the board in data center. Keep in mind that it\\'s not just A100. We are continuing to sell V100 or T4. And we\\'re also bringing new versions of the A100 coming to overall market. So I hope that helps you understand our statements on where are we at in terms of the Q3 guidance. We\\'ll see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more to that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, when we\\'re ramping, we sure love to have more and sooner. And -- but this is our plan, and we\\'re executing to the plan. It is a very complicated product, as Colette mentioned. It is the most complicated.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. Got it. And just a quick follow-up. Within the data center guidance, how do you think about like the core data center sequential growth versus Mellanox?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So in terms of moving from Q2 to Q3, we believe that most of the actual growth that we will receive in that single -- low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth will likely stem from NVIDIA compute, will be the largest driver of that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI wonder if I could ask a longer-term question about the -- how you guys see the importance of process technology. There\\'s been a lot of discussion around that in the CPU domain. But you guys haven\\'t really felt the need to be first on 7 nanometer, and you\\'ve done very well. Just how important do you think it is to be early in the new process node? And how does that factor into the cycle of innovation at NVIDIA?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. First of all, thanks, Joe. The process technology is a lot more complex than a number. I think people have simplified it down to almost a ridiculous level, right? And so process technology, we have a really awesome process engineering team, world-class. Everybody will recognize that it\\'s absolutely world-class. And we work with the foundries, we work with TSMC really closely, to make sure that we engineer transistors that are ideal for us and we engineer metallization systems that\\'s ideal for us. It\\'s a complicated thing, and we do it at high part. \\\\nThen the second part of it is where architecture, where the process technology and the rest of the design process, the architecture of the chip, and the final analysis, what NVIDIA paid for, is architecture, not procurement of transistors. We\\'re paid for architecture. And there\\'s a vast difference between our architecture and the second best architecture and the rest of the architectures. The difference is incredible. We are easily twice the energy efficiency all the time, irrespective of the number of the -- in the transistor side. And so it must be more complicated than that. And so we put a lot of energy into that, and then the last thing I would say is that going forward, it\\'s really about data center-scale computing. Going forward, you optimize at the data center scale. And the reason why I know this for a fact is because if you\\'re a software engineer, you would be sitting at home right now, and you will write a piece of software that runs on the entire data center in the cloud. You have no idea what\\'s underneath it, nor do you care. And so what you really want is to make sure that, that data center is as high throughput as possible. There are a lot of code in there. \\\\nAnd so what NVIDIA has decided to do over the years is to take our game to a new level. Of course, we start with building the world\\'s best processors, and we use the world\\'s best foundries, and we partnered them very closely to engineer the best process for us. We partner with the best packaging companies to create the world\\'s best packaging. We\\'re the world\\'s first user of cobots. And whether it\\'s -- I think we\\'re -- I\\'m pretty sure we\\'re still the highest volume by far of 2.5D and 3D packaging. \\\\nAnd so we start from a great chip. We start from a great chip, but we don\\'t end there. That\\'s just the beginning for us. Now we take this thing all the way through systems, the system software, algorithms, networking, all the way up to the entire data center. And the difference is absolutely shocking. We built our data center, Selene, and it took us 4 weeks. We put up Selene in 4 weeks\\' time. It is the seventh fastest supercomputer in the world, one of the fastest AI supercomputers in the world. It\\'s the most energy-efficient supercomputer in the world, and it broke every single record in MLPerf, and that kind of shows you something about the scale that we work and the complexity of the work that we do. This is the future. It\\'s for -- the future is about data centers.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWe have no further questions at this time. Jensen Huang, I turn the call back over to you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. The accelerated computing model we pioneered has clearly passed the tipping point. Adopting of NVIDIA computing is accelerating. On this foundation and leveraging one architecture, we have transformed our company in 3 dimensions. First, NVIDIA is a full stack computing platform company, offering the world\\'s most dynamic industries, the chips systems, software and libraries like NVIDIA AI to tackle their most pressing challenges. NVIDIA -- second, NVIDIA is a data center-scale company with capabilities to architect, build and operate the most advanced data centers. The data center is the new computing unit. With this capability, we can create modern data center architectures that are computer maker partners, and then scale out to the world\\'s industry. Third, NVIDIA is a software-defined company today, with rich software content like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA virtual workstation in the cloud, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Drive that will add recurring software revenue to our business model. \\\\nIn the coming years, AI will revolutionize software.

Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We made history in the second quarter, both as the first company to simultaneously launch high-performance CPUs and GPUs and the first to ramp 7-nanometer high-performance processors across PCs, gaming and the data center. I\\'m extremely pleased with our execution in the quarter as we ramped production on Ryzen 3000 CPUs, Radeon 300 GPUs and early volumes of our second-generation EPYC processors, in advance of their third quarter launch. \\\\nLooking at the second quarter, revenue of $1.53 billion increased 20% sequentially driven by growth across both of our business segments. Revenue declined 13% year-over-year in line with our expectations as client and server processor revenue increases were offset by lower graphics channel and semi-custom revenue. \\\\nTurning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue declined 13% year-over-year as significantly higher client processor sales were offset by lower graphics channel sales. Mobile client processor revenue increased by a double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequentially driven by our highest quarterly unit shipments in 5 years. In desktop, we launched our industry-leading Ryzen 3000 processors featuring our new Zen 2 core to overwhelmingly positive customer response. Numerous third-party reviews highlighted the superior performance of our 7-nanometer Ryzen CPUs in both multi-threaded and single-threaded applications while consuming less power than competitive offerings. Ryzen 3000 processor customer demand has been very strong, with sales at global e-tailers and retailers outpacing our previous generations of Ryzen by more than 3x at the same point following their respective launches. \\\\nBased on the market response to our latest mobile and desktop processors and the growing number of AMD-powered commercial and consumer PCs, we expect to gain share in the high volume back-to-school and holiday periods. \\\\nIn Graphics, revenue decreased year-over-year driven largely by lower channel sales partially offset by a significant increase in data center GPU sales. GPU revenue increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially driven by increased channel sales of our RX 500 series GPUs and the launch of our Radeon 5700 family. The Radeon 5700 series with our new RDNA architecture, delivers up to 1.5x more performance per watt compared to our previous generation. Initial demand for our new GPUs has been strong as third-party reviewers have highlighted our leadership gaming performance at relevant price points. We are well positioned for growth in the second half of the year as we continue to ramp our Radeon 5000 GPU family. \\\\nWe had another quarter of strong year-over-year data center GPU sales growth driven largely by HPC and cloud wins. We continue making progress expanding this margin-accretive part of our business based on our strategy to focus on working closely with marquee customers. \\\\nWe also announced a strategic partnership in the quarter with Samsung to bring Radeon graphics to their future smartphone and mobile SoCs. The partnership showcases our strategy to engage with industry leaders across the ecosystem to drive Radeon everywhere. We now have deep partnerships across the PC, game console, cloud and mobile markets that contribute to a growing developer ecosystem and installed base for our Radeon graphics architecture. \\\\nTurning to Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue decreased 12% from a year ago due to lower semi-custom revenue. In semi-custom, we have extended our game console leadership as both Microsoft and Sony have now both announced they will use custom AMD SoCs to power their next-generation game consoles. We are very proud to power back-to-back generations of the world\\'s highest performing game consoles. \\\\nAs we look into the second half of the year, we are seeing additional softness in game console demand, which is now reflected in our full year guidance. \\\\nIn server, CPU revenue grew significantly year-over-year and sequentially driven by initial shipments of our next-generation Rome processors to lead cloud and OEM customers. First-generation EPYC processor-based cloud deployments continued to increase in the quarter. Amazon expanded availability of its EPYC processor-powered instances to the more than 15 regions and dozens of new configurations. And Microsoft launched general availability of its Azure HB supercomputing virtual machine that, for the first time ever, enabled customers to run demanding HPC workloads in the cloud. \\\\nTurning to our next-generation Rome server processor, Rome is on-time and exceed expectations, delivering leadership performance and TCO across a significantly expanded number of cloud and enterprise workloads. Customer excitement continues to grow. Compared to our first-generation EPYC processors, we have more than twice the number of platforms in development with a larger set of partners. We also have 4x more enterprise and cloud customers actively engaged on deployments prior to launch. As a result, Rome is on track to ramp significantly faster than our first-generation EPYC processor. \\\\nWe are seeing particular strength in HPC, where we offer leadership compute density and I/O. We had multiple supercomputing wins in the quarter, including public announcements from Indiana University and Norway\\'s National Research Network. Our supercomputing momentum was highlighted by the U.S. Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, selecting both EPYC CPUs and Radeon Instinct GPUs to power their next-generation Frontier exascale supercomputer built by Cray. Frontier is expected to be the world\\'s fastest computer when it launches in 2021. We look forward to providing more details on Rome at our launch event in August 7. \\\\nIn summary, as we complete the first half of 2019, we have reached a significant inflection point for the company as we enter our next phase of growth with the most competitive product portfolio in our history. We have seen some uncertainties across our supply chain driven by tariffs, trade concerns and the U.S. entities list. In the second quarter, we stopped shipping to customers added to the U.S. entities list. While we remained cautious given the fluidity of the situation, the impact to date has been limited and offset by growing momentum in other parts of our business. \\\\nWe are executing well to our plans and see a path to significant market share gains for our product portfolio across the PC, gaming and data center markets in the coming quarters. \\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with the financial results for the first half of 2019, which provide a solid foundation for the second half of the year. Second quarter revenue of $1.53 billion grew 20% over the first quarter. Gross margin of 41% increased 4 percentage points from the prior year driven by the ramp of our strong portfolio of high-performance products. \\\\nQuarterly revenue was down 13% from a year ago. Strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and our new Radeon RX 5700 GPUs were more than offset by lower semi-custom sales and lower graphics channeled sales associated with blockchain. Operating expenses grew 10% year-over-year to $512 million driven primarily by go-to-market activities and new product introductions. Operating income was $111 million, down from $186 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Operating margin was 7%, down from 11% a year ago. Net income was $92 million compared to $156 million a year ago. And diluted earnings per share was $0.08 per share compared to $0.14 per share a year ago. \\\\nNow turning to the business segment result. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $940 million, down 13% year-over-year as strong client processor sales were more than offset by lower overall graphic sales due to negligible blockchain-related revenue in the second quarter of 2019. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $22 million compared to $117 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue. \\\\nIn the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue was $591 million, down 12% from the prior year. Semi-Custom revenue was lower and partially offset by significant growth in data center CPU revenue. EESC segment operating income was $89 million compared to $69 million a year ago. The improvement was largely due to growth in data center CPU revenue. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Year-over-year, we have reduced gross debt by $392 million, and in the second quarter, we also replaced our asset-backed loan facility with a $500 million secured revolving line of credit. \\\\nFree cash flow was negative $28 million in the quarter, while cash flow from operations was $30 million. Inventory was $1 billion, up $60 million sequentially, primarily due to increased inventory of our new 7-nanometer products in anticipation of accelerating product sales in the back half of the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million compared to $228 million a year ago due to lower quarterly earnings. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $672 million, and gross leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.9x. \\\\nTurning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 9% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. The sequential and year-over-year increases are expected to be driven by Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon product sales, partially offset by lower-than-expected semi-custom sales. \\\\nIn addition, for Q3 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 43%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $525 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million; and third quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.21 billion shares. \\\\nFor the full year, we now believe revenue will increase mid-single-digit percent over 2018 driven by significant sales growth of our new Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon processors, partially offset by lower-than-expected semi-custom revenue. Revenue, excluding semi-custom, is expected to increase approximately 20% year-over-year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 42%. \\\\nIn closing, we had a strong first half of 2019. We remain focused on executing to our plans for the remainder of the year and look forward to ramping our new Ryzen and Radeon products as well as the upcoming launch of Rome. \\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready for our first question, please?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So my question is really just twofold. Number one, first on the gross margin side. So you guys have talked about semi-custom coming down pretty materially, and that\\'s kind of the entire reason for the, I guess the mid-single-digit growth number. So why, I guess, aren\\'t the gross margins expanding a little more if you\\'re seeing more traction on the server side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think, if we look at it from an overall standpoint, in Q2, we did 41%. In the third quarter in a row, 41% gross margin. And in Q3, you\\'re right that the decline in semi-custom, there is benefit to the margin. And the margin guide for Q3, that\\'s approximately 43%. I can tell you that the richer product mix, especially with the new products ramping in Q3, are going to drive the gross margin. Although there is a benefit from the decline of semi-custom also, the margin benefit is more weighted towards the non-semi-custom business, and that\\'s where we end up with the 43% in Q3. We\\'ve also updated our guidance for 2019 and now are projecting 42% for the year 2019.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I guess, just a follow-up on that. So the assumption is that by the end of \\'19, you guys have more share on the server side. So I guess just high level, if I assume that 2020 gross margins are going to start going up as well if you keep gaining share in server. Is that a fair assumption for the next year or so?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think what I would say is we\\'re very pleased with the progress we have made on the margin in 2019. The product mix continues to get richer, and we\\'ll see as we get closer to 2020 in terms of the specifics. But you\\'re right, the product mix does get better. And even in the other businesses, including the client business, the product mix being richer benefits the margin.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Good to see the traction in the new products. Lisa, for my first question, I was wondering if you could give us some more color around the traction you\\'re seeing in Rome, both from if you\\'re able to quantify it somewhat, but importantly, the traction you\\'re seeing with customers, whether there is any pricing pressure from your main competitor. And I think in the past, you have outlined targets to reach certain market share. Just now that the product is out in front of customers, how are you seeing that traction with both the cloud and the enterprise side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, we are very pleased with how Rome is coming up. We did ship initial shipments this past quarter in the second quarter to both cloud and enterprise customers. The feedback that we\\'re getting from customers is that the performance is very compelling both from a performance standpoint as well as a total cost of ownership standpoint. We\\'ve gotten a number of wins on both the cloud and the enterprise side as well as HPC. From our standpoint, next week is a big week for us. Obviously, we\\'re going to officially launch Rome on August 7. But from a customer pull standpoint, we see good customer pull. \\\\nYour question specifically about the pricing environment, the pricing environment is always competitive. We expect it to be competitive. That being the case, in servers, price is not the first variable in terms of a buying decision. And so we believe the value proposition that we have for Rome from an overall standpoint is very strong, and we see a good pricing environment for that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And as my follow-up, on the quantification side, I think in the last quarter, you had given us some color around data centers, CPU and GPU kind of around that mid-teens as a percentage of sales. I was hoping you could give us some sense of what it was in Q2 and just what the outlook is for 2019 or the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So in the second quarter, the percentages are similar to the past few quarters in terms of percentage of our business. We were more heavily weighted towards CPU versus GPU in the second quarter, so we saw data center GPU sequentially decline as expected. The CPUs grew as expected. As we go into the second half of the year, you should expect that the percentage of our revenue through the data center will increase as we ramp room.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, obviously, it seems like you\\'re making a lot of progress with Rome or at least the initial feedback continues to be very positive. That said, the overall hyperscale environment seems pretty slow based on commentary from your peers and your customers, I guess. Could that impact the ramp into the second half? Is that a concern for you going forward? And then I have a follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So look, we certainly have heard the same conversation, especially around the cloud environment in the first half of the year. Our plan was always very heavily second half weighted. And from our standpoint, we have seen significant customer engagement and pull for the Rome product, and we see a number of new installations that will come online over the next couple of quarters. So I believe that there is some cloud digestion that\\'s happening out there. I also believe that given where we are from the product cycle standpoint, we are well positioned to grow.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And then as a follow-up, I was hoping to learn a little bit more about the partnership with Samsung, the IP win in the quarter and also Frontier on the HPC side. Just from a modeling perspective, how should we think about those 2 deals, if you will, over the next couple of years and the accretion to the P&L?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So look, we\\'re very pleased with both. They\\'re both very significant announcements for us. On the Samsung side, it\\'s a multiyear, multigenerational deal that we have across our graphics portfolio for mobile. In terms of 2019, the revenue is approximately $100 million that would be added. This was not originally in our guidance, and it offsets some of the headwinds that we talked about in semi-custom and in China. As it -- it\\'s not pure IP, though, so the way you should think about it is there is some specific development expenses that are being -- that are part of that deal. And so those will be part of the COGS portion of that. As it relates to Frontier, Frontier again, very significant deal for us. It is NRE for the next couple of years to really get the software and infrastructure. I would say, that\\'s not material. And it\\'s a relatively smaller number. And then, the actual deployment will be in 2021. So the bulk of the CPU and the GPU revenue will be in 2021, with a small portion of that perhaps in the second half of 2020.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question or is coming from Matt Ramsey from Cowen and Company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I think we\\'ll be hearing plenty about Rome next week. I wanted to ask some questions about your PC business going into the back half of the year. The desktop momentum seems there. The notebook space, Intel is obviously going on to 10-nanometer for a portion of that portfolio. And it seems the 7-nanometer refresh on your side is a little bit later, yet the SKU coverage you\\'ve talked about, I think, is 50% higher than it was last year for back-to-school and holidays. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the momentum in the PC business into the back half and the differences between what you might see in desktop and notebook.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, Matt. So we\\'re pleased with the progress of our PC business. In the second quarter, we had notebook perform very well. We saw a ramp of our second-generation mobile product, and that is due to some of the additional platforms that we mentioned. Going into the second half of the year, on the desktop side, our third-generation Ryzen products are very well positioned. We expect to ramp significant production here in the third quarter. And we expect that to lead to share gains. And we\\'re also feeling quite good about the mobile products into the second half of the year. We made progress on both consumer and commercial. We had always been strong in consumer, but on the commercial side, we have a number of new platforms as well, and those are ramping here into the second half of the year. So overall, I think the PC business continues to be a good opportunity for us to gain share through the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And as a follow-up for me, a couple things for Devinder. I wonder if you might talk about the margin or gross margin differential between some of the new 7-nanometer products that you\\'re rolling out versus some of the predecessor products that were either on 12 or 14, just so we can get an understanding on magnitude. And before you take that, just congrats on cash positive for the company overall, even in some of the verticals.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Yes. So on the margin side, the new products, as we have said previously, in aggregate are greater than 50% margin. And so as we launch the new products, in particular on the 7-nanometer node, those are accretive. And that\\'s why you see us updating the guidance in terms of the margin not just for the quarter in Q3 but also for the year. And from that standpoint, as the product mix gets richer with more 7-nanometer products ramping, that should benefit the gross margin.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congrats on the execution with the 7-nanometer. Lisa, are you guys constrained in terms of 7-nanometer at TSM?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hans, yes. So we do have a number of products ramping at TSMC in 7-nanometer and we are not constrained per se. I will say that cycle times of 7-nanometer are longer, and so it just takes more time to ramp up, but we are not constrained. TSMC has supported us quite well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And can you give us a sense, if you can, on 7-nanometer high-end Navi and mobile 7-nanometer CPUs, if you can?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hans, you asked the good product questions. I would say, they are coming. You should expect that our execution on those are on track, and we have a rich 7-nanometer portfolio beyond the products that we have currently announced in the upcoming quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, you have a lot of things working for you. You\\'ve got Rome, Ryzen, the GPU portfolio. Where are you seeing the biggest upside surprise on the feedback that you\\'re getting relative to your original expectations?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So look, Mark, I think all products have really performed quite well. I think the third-generation Ryzen desktop, both in terms of the reviews -- third-party reviews as well as just the customer interest, what we see is obviously it\\'s only been in market for 3 weeks, and so we watch the data points very carefully. But across the globe, we\\'re seeing sort of significant uptick in our share in the desktop market. I think Navi has come out positioned very well. We\\'re very pleased with our RDNA architecture. Navi is the first step, and we have a couple more steps going. And then we\\'ll talk much more about EPYC next week. I think the key thing is the products have been on schedule and at or above the performance. So our goal is of course to turn that into revenue growth in the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, that\\'s great color. And a follow-up if I may, you mentioned the gen 5 game console wins at Microsoft and Sony. Can you give us a sense, when do these start to ramp? When they ramp, do you book the revenues as you build inventory as you did in the previous generation? And is there going to be -- should we think about anything differently on the gross margin profile? Is it going to be similar to what you\\'ve had in the past on these things? So just some color on the gen 5 game consoles.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So Mark, we\\'re proud of the wins at Sony and Microsoft. Those are big wins for us and, as you know, over many years. We can\\'t comment on specific customers and their ramp profiles. The only thing I will say is, you can expect that in general, consumer ramps are second half weighted, especially weighted towards the holiday season. And you would expect that. And then as it relates to the gross margin profiles, with our semi-custom business model, I think the margins will be under the corporate average. However, our business model is actually quite different. If you look forward to our business model, the growth that we see across all of our other products, Ryzen, EPYC, Radeon is actually quite significant. And so the percentage of semi-custom as a percent of the overall business will be lower than, for example, in the last few years.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          For my first one, I want to follow up on that second half gross margin question again. I want to put some numbers behind it. So you\\'re guiding 43% for Q3. Your implied guidance for Q4 is 43% and maybe a little under. It\\'s only up about 150 bps year-over-year and flat sequentially, but you\\'re guiding Q4 revenues of over 50% year-over-year. And consoles have to be falling like 40% to 50% sequentially, so the mix has to be massively switching over to the new products that, in aggregate, have gross over 50%. Why are gross margins only being guided up like 160 bps year-over-year in Q4 given that kind of a revenue trajectory? And why is it only flat sequentially even with revenues growing over 20% quarter-on-quarter into Q4? I don\\'t understand.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Stacy, let me start, and then maybe Devinder can add to it. So we guide approximately to full margin points. What you should expect as we go from Q3 to Q4 is that the product mix will get better, so we will expect more new products. And from the standpoint of semi-custom, semi-custom will be down sequentially Q3 to Q4. And so you should expect that we are not implying that the margin will be down in Q4, and we\\'ll get to the Q4 guide as we get through the next 90 days.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. For my follow-up, the $100 million from Samsung, did your 20% year-over-year growth excluding the semi-custom include that $100 million that wasn\\'t in the prior guidance? And what is the impact on the gross margins of that Samsung revenue as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So the Samsung additional revenue is included as part of the 20% year-on-year, and it offset some weakness that we have in China due to the entities list. As to the gross margin profile for that, you can expect that to be somewhat above corporate average.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So somewhat over low-40s?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Somewhat above corporate average.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have one question and a follow-up as well. Just building on that last kind of question, I think the last couple of quarters, you\\'ve talked about your semi-custom business being down somewhere in the 20% plus range. It looks like by my math, your assumption now is that, that business declines maybe as much as 40-plus percent. And so when you parse through that, you kind of factor in the Samsung relationship and the incremental $100 million revenue, has your estimate at all changed ex those items? Meaning, revenue ex the semi-custom decline and then also ex the $100 million Samsung?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So let me try to help you, Aaron, with that math. So look, originally, when we started the year, we thought semi-custom would be down, let\\'s call it, approximately 20%. In the first half of the year it was down more than that. And based on what we see today, we would expect the full year now to be down, let\\'s call it, mid-30s year-on-year. If you talk about now the rest of the business, I think the rest of the business is close to where we thought it would be, close plus or minus a couple percent. And if you think about all of the moving pieces, we do have some customers that were not shipping to -- in China. That is offset by the Samsung upside and with the new products and how they\\'re coming in. So I think we are pretty close plus or minus to where we thought we would be ex those factors.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. That\\'s very helpful. And then just looking at your product segmentation, I\\'m curious as how you think about the trajectory of the data center GPU business going forward. Obviously, I can appreciate that could be lumpy, but I\\'m just trying to understand how you see that. Is there a point in time when we can actually get some better visibility into that incremental growth driver or revenue stream going forward?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think that\\'s a fair comment. It is a little bit lumpy because of its size and it\\'s fairly concentrated in a couple of customers. I will say that we\\'re going to see very nice year-over-year growth this year, and we see good customer momentum across both cloud as well as HPC. On the cloud side, it is both, let\\'s call it cloud streaming/gaming as well as machine learning. And on the HPC side, the Frontier win is a public win, but we have a number of others that we\\'re working as well. So I think we give more color as we go forward, but it continues to be a business that we feel will be a good growth driver over the next few years.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Instinet.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          One small clarification and then a second question. The clarification, the Samsung $100 million, does that come in under income statement to the revenue or is it on another line, a special item or something?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It\\'s revenue. So it\\'s revenue, and then offset by some specific development costs and also in COGS. And like Lisa said earlier, the margin, when you take the revenue and the COGS offset, is somewhat above corporate average.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Excellent. And can you give us any numbers in terms of for the June quarter, your sequential unit growth in desktop and notebook processing units and the sales growth PC GPUs?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let\\'s see, David. So in the -- your questions is about the second quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s correct. Yes.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So the second quarter we saw a sequentially mobile units up, and we saw desktop units down. And the desktop units down is somewhat due to the seasonality in the second quarter as well as the fact that we were going through a product transition as we were preparing for the third-generation launch, which happened at the very end of the quarter. In terms of graphics, we were up double digits sequentially, and that\\'s both units and revenue statement as it relates to -- and that was driven primarily by the graphics channel.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So your full quarter -- your full year guidance, mid-single digit. If I sort of project 5%, you need to get to a $2.2 billion number for the December quarter. I guess how literally should I take that? Is there anything -- I understand there\\'s a lot of product momentum. That still seems like a big number. Is there anything we should understand in terms of seasonality or things that would kind of give you confidence in mid-single digit for the full year still?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I think, Joe, our view is that we have significant amount of product launches to happen. So as we go through the third quarter and the fourth quarter, both on the PC side, the GPU side as well as on the server side. So, yes. It is significant growth, and I think we feel good about sort of the drivers there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on these solid results. I apologies if I missed this, Lisa. Just going back to the Samsung revenue. Is that $100 million all coming into the calendar fourth quarter? Or will there be some in the September quarter as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, John. So that $100 million -- approximately $100 million for the year. There was a little bit in Q2, and then the rest will be in Q3 and Q4.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Is there linearity you can talk about on that? Or can we just kind of evenly split it between Q3 and Q4?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think that\\'s close.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then just a similar question on bridging sort of the gap between your Q3 guide and your full year guide as it pertains to OpEx. If you look at kind of the full year guide you\\'re given in OpEx, it could imply that OpEx dollars are actually flat to down sequentially in Q4 on pretty meaningful revenue growth, which is great leverage and understandable on the SG&A line. But I\\'m just kind of curious, how we should be thinking or how you\\'re thinking about the R&D spend as you start to see revenue begin to accelerate again.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Look, I think you should expect that OpEx should be flattish as we go through the rest of the year. And we have increased OpEx. Obviously, the first half of the year was higher OpEx as a percentage of revenue. We are investing in the right places, and I think the product execution shows up. We will evaluate obviously in 2020 as we look through the overall revenue growth picture and what we\\'ll do with OpEx. But I think we\\'ve made the right investments and we\\'ll continue to do so.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And John, if you\\'re looking at additional data since you are doing the math, we expect OpEx to be approximately 30% for 2019, if you take Q3 and Q4 into consideration.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, maybe this something you\\'ll address next week in the Rome launch. But in aggregate, now that we\\'re this much closer to the launch in the second half ramp, which you sound very confident on, a year ago you talked about the market share goals. I think it was double-digit market share, 4 to 6 quarters after you hit the 5% market share. Any sort of update on the timing and/or comfort around hitting that target?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I think, Ross, we feel good about that being the right target. I\\'m not ready to update that yet. I think we want to get through. There\\'s a lot of platforms to launch here in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. We\\'d like to get through some of that. But we feel that the target is the right target. The product is certainly performing well. And now it\\'s about helping our customers get their platforms to market as soon as possible.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. A quick follow-up. It was part of a prior question that I don\\'t think I heard the answer to. But is the accounting for the semi-custom ramp, whenever it may occur next year, the same in so far as when you build it, you recognize the revenue? So even if the customer tends to ramp in consumer in the half year, you guys obviously have to build and get the inventory stage, et cetera, much earlier than that, and therefore that would be revenue? Or did something change accounting-wise that that\\'s no longer true?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. That was asked earlier, and I don\\'t think I responded to it. The accounting is the same, so I don\\'t think the accounting changes. The only difference, though, is we tend -- we would not ramp a product prior to qualification. So there are some -- when you\\'re doing a brand-new product, there is a more involved qualification cycle. And so I think there would be -- it would be more commensurate with the actual product shipments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So 2 things would happen more simultaneously, is what you\\'re saying?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Correct.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I also had a clarification, Lisa. I\\'m not sure I quite understood. In the delta for revenues, you talked about semi-custom, and then you also said that China is having an impact. What specific product areas are those? And is that -- THATIC is also part of that? And then I have a follow-up for Devinder.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we did have a small impact due to China. We have several customers that are now on the U.S. entities list, and we stopped shipping to those customers in the second quarter. And so it\\'s a small impact, but there is impact that is offset by some of the positives in the rest of the business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So I\\'m assuming that\\'s CPUs, desktop and/or server, both, right?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          There is some PC business and there\\'s some server business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [73]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then Devinder, my follow-up is on free cash flow. The gap between free cash flow per share and earnings per share is massive. If I look at the first 2 quarters, roughly $300 million, negative free cash flow, but you\\'re guiding for positive -- for the full year. Can you put some numbers around that? Is that tens of millions? Or what\\'s the right way to think about that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [74]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think, so if you asked in Q3, we expect to be free cash flow positive and free cash flow positive for the year. It won\\'t be tens of millions from a year\\'s standpoint. I think it\\'s triple digit, but I\\'m not going to give you a specific number.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m just curious on the notebook market. Intel talked about some pull-ins, but also ensuring the market. You\\'re ramping products. Just wondering if you can parse those items out because notebook was pretty strong for you in June. Just curious if that impacts any seasonality at the end of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [77]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Blayne. From our standpoint, our notebook ramps were due to platform breadth. We ramped a number of second-generation platforms as well as some new Chrome platforms. I can\\'t say that I can point to any particular pull-ins, per se. I think we\\'re still expecting that we have -- we see a seasonal uplift in the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [78]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then maybe just a follow-on to that. In your September guidance, if you look between the Computing and Graphics segment, I\\'m wondering, between the 3 segments, if you can just highlight which one you expect to be the strongest?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [79]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So, let\\'s see. I think what I would say is that, amongst the product lines and where they are in their ramp cycle, you would expect perhaps PCs to be the strongest and then graphics and server next.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [80]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [81]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, so for my first question, I just wanted to ask how you think about semi-custom sort of over the longer term? And talk maybe about cloud gaming and sort of how you think about its long-term effect on you. Because on one hand you\\'ve done quite well with some of these big launches coming up, but you\\'re also exposed to some potential cannibalization on the semi-custom side. So I\\'m wondering how you think about those 2 factors?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [82]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so look, I think we like sort of gaming overall. So if you think about gaming overall, there\\'s PC gaming, there\\'s cloud gaming and then there\\'s console gaming. We believe a rich ecosystem is important. We want to have our Radeon graphics architecture across all those 3 segments. \\\\nI\\'ve been asked about the cannibalization question, I think it\\'s too early to talk about that. Maybe in a few years. I mean we think cloud gaming is going to be important, but it\\'s too early to say whether it\\'s really a cannibalization thing, or is it an additive, getting access to more users overall. So our goal is to make sure that our architecture is very friendly to all segments of gaming.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [83]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And then I just wanted to go back to the question that Ross just asked about, the server share target. So it\\'s not that you\\'re not reiterating that target here. It\\'s more that you\\'re going to update us on the target when you launch Rome. Is that the right way to think about it?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [84]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No. Let me say it this way. I think we do stand by the target, so the target being double-digit, sort of 4 to 6 quarters after the initial 5%. I think we feel good about that target. I\\'m not being more specific than that until we get through more of the ramp.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [85]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session, I\\'d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [86]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We\\'re good. That was a good call. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for AMD\\'s second quarter call today. We look forward to speaking with you from San Francisco on August the 7th, and we appreciate your support of our company.

Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. While 2015 was a challenging year from a financial perspective, the dedicated commitment of our employees, combined with our long-term technology investments and sharpened focus, have created a strong foundation for future growth.\\\\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue decreased 10% sequentially to $958 million, as seasonally lower semi-custom SoC shipments were partially offset by the second straight quarter of double-digit percentage revenue growth in our computing and graphics business.\\\\nLooking at our computing and graphics segment, revenue increased 11% sequentially as we continued to improve the performance of our PC business. We had strong double-digit sequential percentage growth in mobile APU sales, driven largely by increased Carrizo shipments and good sellthrough of AMD-based PCs on Black Friday.\\\\nIn the channel, we delivered our third straight quarter of sequential revenue growth and further reduced downstream product inventories based on improved demand for FX CPUs and A-Series APUs. We also made progress diversifying our client computing revenue as we further expand into the commercial PC market.\\\\nSecond-half 2015 commercial APU unit shipments increased more than 15% from the first half of the year. We believe we can continue to grow our commercial shipments based on the high-volume wins we are securing both across large enterprises and the public sector.\\\\nNow shifting to graphics, GPU revenue increased sequentially for the second straight quarter, driven by improved AIB channel sales of our Radeon 300 series across the enthusiast performance and mainstream segments and growth in professional graphics sales. The PC gaming market strength helped fuel a richer GPU mix and improved demand for our high-end Radeon R9 series in the quarter. We expect this momentum to continue throughout 2016 as Oculus and HTC begin shipping consumer-ready VR headsets.\\\\nThe buzz and interest in VR is an exciting trend that is focusing the software industry\\'s attention and some of its brightest minds back on the PC platform. While the initial wave of VR will be focused on gaming, an increasing number of developers see VR as the most significant advancement in how we interact with technology since the introduction of the mouse and graphical user interface. Most importantly, these breakthrough software experiences will only be enabled with high performance energy efficient GPUs.\\\\nOverall, we made good progress further stabilizing our PC business in the fourth quarter. And we believe we are well positioned to navigate the seasonally weaker first half of the year and ongoing challenges in the China PC market due to macro conditions.\\\\nTurning to our enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment, revenue declined 23% sequentially, in line with our expectations as semi-custom sales decreased from their third-quarter seasonal peak. We had record annual semi-custom unit shipments in 2015 and have shipped more than 50 million semi-custom APUs as a critical and trusted partner to Sony and Microsoft.\\\\nDemand for game consoles looks strong for 2016 and we remain on track to generate additional revenue from new semi-custom business in the second half of 2016. We also began production shipments of our first 64-bit data-center-class ARM SoC and expect additional system introductions from our partners throughout 2016 as the ARM 64 infrastructure ecosystem further develops.\\\\nNow turning to the year ahead. We remain focused on completing our strategic work around three key growth pillars. First, in PCs, even in a declining overall market, we believe we can regain client compute and discrete graphics share for the year, driven by gaming, VR, commercial, and our most competitive product roadmap in more than a decade.\\\\nWe have clear opportunities to regain GPU share in 2016 based on the performance per watt of our new GPUs and software leadership. Earlier this quarter at CES, we announced our new Polaris GPU architecture, which we expect to begin shipping in the middle of 2016.\\\\nPolaris combines significant design enhancements as well as 14-nanometer FinFET process technology to deliver double the performance per watt of our current GPU offerings. Customer response has been excellent, particularly in the notebook space, where for the first time ever there will be a GPU architecture capable of bringing high-end gaming and VR experiences to thin and light notebooks.\\\\nIn client computing, our opportunities to regain share in 2016 will be driven by our design win momentum, continued progress expanding into the commercial market, and reentering the high-performance desktop market late in the year with our Zen-based Summit Ridge CPU.\\\\nOur second growth pillar is in the $15-billion-plus data center and infrastructure markets, driven by our FirePro GPUs and next-generation server CPUs.\\\\nOur Zen-based GPU development is on track to achieve greater than 40% IPC uplift from our previous generation and we\\'re on schedule to sample later this year. We have secured several key design wins with global OEMs for our Zen-based server CPU and believe we can rapidly reestablish our presence in the data center when we bring our new products to market in 2017.\\\\nWith FirePro, we plan to leverage our upcoming Polaris architecture and suite of new software tools designed to dramatically simplify GPU computing to accelerate the adoption of FirePro in the HPC and data center markets.\\\\nOur third growth pillar is focused on further expanding the TAM for our products and technologies through ramping our previously communicated semi-custom wins, converting additional semi-custom pipeline opportunities, and gaining share in targeted embedded markets.\\\\nWe also have near-term opportunities to strategically monetize our valuable IP in 2016 through licensing and partnerships that are complementary to our product development efforts. I look forward to sharing the initial results of our IP monetization strategy in the coming quarters.\\\\nWhile we expect revenue to be lower in the first half of 2016 compared to the second half based on the seasonality of the PC and game console businesses, we remain focused on successfully executing our product and technology roadmaps and plan to return AMD to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of 2016 and generate positive cash flow from operations for the year.\\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth-quarter financial performance. Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2015, notwithstanding a difficult PC market and financial losses, we continued our multiyear effort to transition our business model by diversifying revenue and establishing a foundation for improved financial performance.\\\\nWe made progress in stabilizing the computing and graphics segment and achieved strong double-digit percentage revenue growth in the second half of 2015. We also reduced overall channel inventory significantly from the prior year. In our EESC segment, we had record shipments of our semi-custom SoCs powering the Playstation 4 and Xbox One game consoles.\\\\nIn total, against a backdrop of a 28% revenue decline from 2014, we reduced our cost profile with a 14% decrease in OpEx, managed our inventory down, and maintained our cash well within our target range of $600 million to $1 billion.\\\\nNow let me provide the specifics of the fourth quarter. Revenue was $958 million, down 10% sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs, partially offset by higher computing and graphics segment sales. The year-over-year decline was 23% due primarily to lower client processor and chipset sales and lower game console royalties.\\\\nGross margin was 30%, a 7 percentage point improvement from the prior quarter, with 6 percentage points resulting from the impact of a $65 million inventory write-down in Q3.  And the remainder primarily from improved product mix in the computing and graphics segment.\\\\nOperating expenses were $323 million, down $13 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower headcount and ongoing expense control. Operating loss was $39 million and net loss was $79 million, with loss per share of $0.10, calculated using 791 million shares.\\\\nNet interest, other expense, and taxes were $40 million in the quarter compared to $39 million in the prior quarter. The GAAP results include a $13 million tax settlement in a foreign jurisdiction. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $5 million, improving from negative $55 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments. Computing and graphics revenue was $470 million, up 11% sequentially, primarily due to higher notebook processor sales. This is the second consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage revenue growth for this segment as we increased sales on both our client compute and graphics processors in Q4. Computing and graphics segment operating loss was $99 million, improving from $181 million the prior quarter, primarily due to higher sales and the absence of a third-quarter 2015 inventory write-down.\\\\nEnterprise embedded and semi-custom revenue was $488 million, down 23% from the prior quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs. The operating income of this segment was $59 million, down from $84 million in the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower semi-custom product sales.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $785 million at the end of the quarter, up $30 million from the end of the prior quarter. Inventory was $678 million, down $83 million or 11% from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to reduced levels of semi-custom SoC inventory.\\\\nWe have concluded our wafer reprofiling discussions related to the 2015 WSA amendment with GLOBALFOUNDRIES and will be moving approximately $60 million of wafer purchases from that amendment to later in 2016. To date, total wafer purchases under the 2015 WSA amendment are approximately $1 billion, including approximately $150 million of wafer purchases which were not taken until early in our fiscal first quarter 2016. We are currently negotiating the 2016 WSA amendment.\\\\nDebt as of the end of the quarter was $2.26 billion, flat on the end of the prior quarter, including total borrowings of $230 million on our secured revolving line of credit, unchanged from the prior quarter. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was a positive $21 million, an improvement of $105 million from the third quarter of 2015.\\\\nTurning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2016, which is based on a 13-week quarter, AMD expects revenue to decrease 14% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, driven by game console seasonality and a cautious macro environment in China. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 32%.\\\\nNon-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $320 million. Interest expense, taxes, and other to be approximately $42 million. Cash and cash equivalent balances to be down approximately $100 million from the end of the fourth quarter, including $70 million of cash interest payments.\\\\nThis cash balance does not include any cash proceeds related to the ATMP JV with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics. We expect to close that transaction in the first half of 2016 pending regulatory and other approvals and expect cash flow proceeds of approximately $320 million net of taxes and other expenses upon closure. Inventory is expected to be approximately flat from fourth-quarter levels.\\\\nOur fiscal year 2016 is based on 53 weeks and we plan to take the extra week in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to grow year over year. Non-GAAP operating expenses between $320 million and $340 million per quarter as we continue to invest in leadership products and in line with our expected revenue profile.\\\\nInterest expense, taxes, and other will be approximately $45 million per quarter. Cash and cash equivalent balances to be in the optimal zone of $600 million to $1 billion. Capital expenditures of approximately $70 million. Inventory to be down year over year, and to return to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of 2016 and generate positive free cash flow from operations for the year.\\\\nIn closing, as we begin the new year, we remain focused on financial and operational execution and look forward to building on our second-half 2015 product and roadmap momentum throughout 2016 across the three areas that Lisa outlined: high-performance PCs, the data center, and TAM expansion through semi-custom and embedded opportunities.\\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Liz. Liz?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLiz Morali,  AMD - Director, IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, can you please poll the audience for questions?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions)\\\\nDavid Wong, Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks very much. Looking at your guidance for growth, year-over-year growth in revenue in 2016, you are ending with the last quarter your game console revenues down year over year. Do you expect game console revenues to grow in 2016 as a whole? And what other things will drive overall growth for 2016?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          David, thanks for the question. So let me give you a bit of color through the guidance and how we view 2016. So if you look at overall 2016, we do expect to grow revenues. And if you look at our business, we see certainly the second-half revenue will be stronger than the first half because of both of our businesses.\\\\nGame consoles -- we see units going up 2016 to 2015. We\\'ve also said in the enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment that we will be ramping some new design revenue in the second half of 2016.  So we see that as a positive growth driver.\\\\nAnd then if you look overall at our computing and graphics business, we do believe even in a down PC market that we have the opportunity to gain share as a growth vector in computing and graphics. So those are the overall drivers for the 2016 comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up. I understand that you don\\'t breakout all the details, but can you give us some feeling as to whether your discrete GPU business is showing year-over-year growth at the moment, either in the December quarter or expected for the March quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So as you say, we don\\'t go into that level of detail. I think what we have said is that we did see growth in our discrete graphics business sequentially in both Q3 and Q4. As we look into 2016 with our discrete graphics business, we have a strong product portfolio. And particularly the ramp and introduction of our new FinFET products -- codenamed Polaris -- will happen in the middle of 2016, so that will be a 2016 growth driver.\\\\nSo certainly we\\'ve seen some sequential improvement in the second half of 2015 and we look forward to those product releases in 2016.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Ian Ing, MKM Partners.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks. Could you talk more about the channel business in light of your cautious comments on macro in China. Are you seeing weakness potentially in the ODM business or the white box market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Ian, I think overall if you look at the channel business in the second half of the year for us -- second half 2015 relative to first half 2015 -- we have made quite a bit of progress in the channel in terms of just overall inventory levels. We saw a good quarter in the fourth quarter in both North America and Europe.\\\\nWe did see a degradation in China towards the end of the fourth quarter. And I think there are cautious comments throughout the industry about sort of the early 2016 start for China. So I think overall what I would say is I\\'m pleased with the progress we\\'ve made in the channel. I think in both the desktop channel as well as the AIB channel we\\'ve made some progress in the second half of the year.\\\\nI think China is a factor as we go into the first quarter, but I think overall we still view the channel as a positive business for AMD and one in which we believe we can grow share.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Great. And then Devinder, your OpEx guidance range: $320 million to $340 million in the coming quarters. Can you give us a sense of the timing of some of the upcoming mask costs, given you\\'ve got Zen-based cores and Polaris coming up?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I would say I think you\\'ve hit the nail on the head. There are new products coming out and there\\'s some [mask to the] cost. I think that\\'s more weighted towards later in the year. From a Q1 time frame, we have given the guidance on the OpEx at the $320 million level compared to where we ended up in Q4 of 2015.\\\\nSo yes, we do have support for the investments in the products we need and in particular the technology and product transitions that we have coming out in 2016.  And that\\'s why you see a range in OpEx of between $320 million and $340 million.\\\\nAnd then a last factor that obviously affects the OpEx is obviously the revenue profile, because Lisa said earlier it\\'s stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And my last question. You\\'re talking now about some GPU share gains in 2016. I mean, does a lot of that come from the Polaris launch starting midyear or is that sort of sustained business from the R9 Series? Or a combination?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we have made some progress in with the R9 Series, particularly as in the fourth quarter. I think as we go forward, it\\'s a combination of things. If you look at our investments in graphics, they really include both hardware and software.\\\\nSo the Polaris family is excellent from a hardware standpoint in terms of the performance per watt that we get. But we have a number of software initiatives that we\\'ve started over the past couple months and will continue. And we see all of those contributing to graphics momentum.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sanjay Chaurasia, Nomura.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSanjay Chaurasia,  Nomura Securities Intl (America) - Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          One question on gross margin. I noticed that you are not providing gross margin guidance for 2016 and I was wondering if you have clarity that your revenue would be up year on year. What are some of the puts and takes here that\\'s making you hold gross margin guidance?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the key is if you look back over the last few quarters, we have made progress on the gross margin front, ending Q4 2015 at a 30% level. And the guidance specifically for Q1 of 2016 is 32%.\\\\nYou\\'re right -- I haven\\'t given guidance for the year. But some of the puts and takes are really the mix of product as we get more into 2016. And then obviously the mix of business between our computing and graphics segment and the EESC segment.\\\\nIn computing and graphics, we have introduced some new products in the second half of 2015 and even going into 2016 and you have some of the commercial success we\\'ve had. And that obviously has gross margin, but at the same time, we want to see how the year unfolds, in particular on the PC side of the house, given some of the comments we made about caution in China in particular.\\\\nSo for the year, I\\'m not giving guidance today. This is kind of a first-quarter guidance at a 32% for gross margin and we\\'ll get through the year as we get into the next one or two quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSanjay Chaurasia,  Nomura Securities Intl (America) - Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then a follow-up, Lisa, a question on servers. You indicated you are shipping your Seattle, but at the same time in your guidance, you didn\\'t mention anything about ARM contributing in 2016. And my question is, is ARM servers a meaningful share for you in 2017 and 2018?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So Sanjay, the ARM server did start shipments and we have shipped our first production unit. I think we have some design wins with it and I would call it a modest revenue contributor in 2016.\\\\nWe still see ARM strategically as a interesting market for the infrastructure markets, but it is certainly developing a bit slower than expected. So I think overall I think it\\'s an important proof point in terms of enterprise class server architectures with ARM, but it\\'s a modest revenue contribution in 2016.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Vivek Arya, BofA Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, just to follow-up on the last one, on ARM servers. The comment about progress being somewhat slower -- do you think that\\'s an AMD-specific trend or does that apply to all the ARM server vendors?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think it\\'s more of a market statement, Vivek, than an AMD-specific statement. I think the overall commentary -- maybe if I just expand a little bit -- is the data center market is really, really interesting. And I think we all agree with that. I think x86 has a lot of momentum and that\\'s one of the reasons that we\\'ve put quite a bit more emphasis on our x86 data center and infrastructure play.\\\\nNow that being said, I think ARM does have a lot of specific areas where it can contribute and it has done so. But I would say in servers in particular perhaps slower than originally expected, but still something to watch for the medium term.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And as I follow up perhaps a longer-term question, which is what is the strategy to actually get to a meaningful earnings and cash flow growth? I understand the macro environment is a little tough right now, but the way I see it, a lot of the progress you guys are making on your embedded products is being offset by the declines in your legacy businesses.\\\\nAnd as the mix is shifting to your embedded products, gross margins are sort of holding around that 30% level, but you\\'re not really able to reduce cost. So sales are finding it tough to grow with that offset; gross margins are not moving up that much and you are now going to hold OpEx steady also. So I\\'m just trying to understand what are we missing here that can help AMD be a more sustainably profitable company? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Vivek. So let me try and then Devinder can add if he has some comments. So I think what you have to do is take a step back and look at overall, the progress in year 2015 from a foundation standpoint and then what we hope to accomplish in 2016 and forward.\\\\nI think the most important message around sustainable profitability for AMD is around our product and technology roadmap and ensuring that we grow share in our target markets. So that is certainly the goal. I think if you look at some of the progress that we made in the second half of 2015, we have seen some stabilization in our computing and graphics business and actually a return to some sequential growth.\\\\nAs we go forward into 2016, we certainly have to continue that momentum in both our client, compute, as well as our graphics business in terms of gaining profitable unit market share. And then as we go forward, we have our data center strategy as well as our semi-custom and new markets that will bring additional opportunities.\\\\nSo from a product standpoint, it is about getting our technology out there and I think we will enter 2016 with the strongest product portfolio we\\'ve had in a long time. And we need to continue to work with our customers on design opportunities and moving the platforms into production as we go through the year 2016.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          If I can add, Lisa, I think the other thing I would add is if you look at a couple of areas that Lisa mentioned -- data center in particular, but also the embedded space. As we talked about in our financial analyst day in May, those are businesses that command higher gross margins.\\\\nSo, Vivek, to your point about the gross margins, I think longer term with that business kicking in in 2017, we believe that we can get closer to the longer-term model. 2016 we\\'ve guided to operating -- free cash flow positive from an operation standpoint. And as we continue to manage the cost, as you said, especially on the OpEx side of the house, improving the gross margin in and of itself obviously benefits the bottom line. And that\\'s kind of heading toward the longer-term model we outlined at the analyst day that we had in May of 2015.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. One last quick clarification: what PC unit declines, Lisa, are you assuming for 2016? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So if you look at the current market projections, it\\'s somewhere in the low single digits. I think if you were to talk to the customer set, it might go from low single digit to mid single digit. So that\\'s the environment that we are forecasting unit share growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Thank you. Good luck.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little more on how you plan to gain share on PCs for the year? Especially since it looks like Zen isn\\'t really launching until the tail end of the year and it looks like you\\'re starting Q1 already in the hole if I compare your guidance versus Intel.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, Stacy, why don\\'t I start and again Devinder can add. So overall if you look at PCs, I think we\\'ll have to wait until the numbers come out, but we believe we have gained a bit of share in Q4.\\\\nI think if you look at the driving factors behind that, Stacy, there were a couple factors. In 2015, I think we did a concerted effort to clean up some of our channel inventory, both on the OEM side as well as in the DIY channel. So that factor will be gone in 2015 relative to 2016.\\\\nI think if you look at the product roadmap, I think the product roadmap is stronger. I think if you look at our commercial business, that is also stronger. So it\\'s leading to a stronger product mix, so those are the key factors.\\\\nRelative to the Q1 guidance -- I\\'ll make a comment about Q1 guidance overall. Our Q1 guidance includes obviously both the computing and graphics and the enterprise embedded and semi-custom business. The semi-custom business is historically significantly lower in the first quarter of the year. If you look at the past couple of years it\\'s been the case because they are coming off of a strong holiday season. So I would say that has to be factored into the guidance.\\\\nAnd then if you look at the computing and graphics business, I think what we\\'re seeing is very consistent with what\\'s out there in the market. And we believe in that market -- that set of market conditions we can gain share.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The only thing I would add, Stacy, is I think too early to tell from a viewpoint of your thinking in terms of the guidance for Q1, that just based on the guidance, we lose share in Q1 in the PC space.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, if I just looked, you\\'re down 14% and Intel down what they are, there is a differential there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the key is to look at the guidance that we gave and trying to parse out where the decline is. And it\\'s kind of more weighted towards the EESC segment than the computing and graphics segment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Okay. Thanks. For my follow-up --\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The other thing -- just one last clarification. I think the thing to bear in mind -- I think I said in my prepared remarks in our quarter this year, actually both from a viewpoint of the quarter and the year, we have a 53-week year and we have a 13-week quarter in Q1.  As opposed to what the competitors and you are doing, I think it\\'s more on the 14 weeks as opposed to 13 weeks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, even if you correct for that, but okay. In terms of my follow-up, just very briefly, does your guidance for positive free cash flow for the year include the proceeds from the backend sale? And does your guidance for a 32% gross margin for next quarter contemplate you selling any of the inventory that you wrote down in Q3?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So the first one is no, it does not. The free cash flow from operations being positive for the year does not include the proceeds from the joint venture for the backend facilities. And then the guidance for the margin at 32% Q1 does not contemplate any sale of previous [sales] of inventory.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And that free cash flow -- that\\'s not operating cash flow guidance, that\\'s free cash flow guidance? (multiple speakers)\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, that\\'s free cash flow. I think the way we defined it is operating cash flow less CapEx.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Matt Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I think there\\'s some -- my observation looking at the product roadmap is there\\'s some pretty big hurdles past: getting Polaris on FinFET, getting Zen on FinFET over the next few quarters.\\\\nI guess relative to some lower operating spending that you guys are doing as a Company, maybe Lisa, you could lay out some priorities for how you are going to roll out these products? I guess particularly I\\'m looking at how you balance semi-custom versus discrete GPU? How you balance enterprise GPUs versus APUs when you roll out Zen. It seems like quite a bit to take on, given the lower spending levels of the business at a whole and I just wonder how you are prioritizing that versus the guidance for the year? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So Matt, I think maybe a couple comments. I will say that I am pleased with the execution on engineering that we have accomplished over the last 12 months. I think we have passed some significant hurdles. The transition to FinFET for us was very, very critical across our businesses and I feel good about the state of the progress there.\\\\nAs it reflects on 2016 spending, I think Devinder commented earlier, but I would say that\\'s why we\\'re giving ourselves a range in the OpEx from $320 million to $340 million. And we are being prudent in where we spend. However, clearly there is a significant focus on discrete graphics and what we can do in that space.\\\\nI think we\\'re very excited about the momentum around virtual reality and the momentum in gaming. And we think that that\\'s a very good market for us.\\\\nI think relative to our CPU competitiveness and retaining competitiveness there, that is a very key priority as well. So Zen across both our client computing as well as our server markets are a priority.\\\\nRelative -- the good thing about our semi-custom business is it does rely on customer investment to customize the roadmap. So I think the combination of those things gives us a reasonable envelope to execute the go-to-market around the product portfolio.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right. Thank you. Thank you for that. And I guess as my follow-up, I think I took away as an impression at least from CES a refocusing of investment on developers, particularly in the GPU space. So Lisa, maybe you could speak to that little bit and how you guys are trying to I guess balance the priorities of the semi-custom business in consoles and gaming with sort of rekindling the brand and maybe rekindling mindshare with developers in the PC gaming community? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the Radeon Technologies Group has added a lot of focus to our graphics activities. And I think as you said, it\\'s both a hardware and software statement. So the work we\\'ve done around our drivers and trying to ensure that we have a good customer experience as well as a good development experience is certainly there. I think the main takeaway is: we know how to do this. It\\'s really a matter of getting the focus and getting it done.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right. Thanks. Good luck.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Srini Pajjuri, CLSA Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSrini Pajjuri,  CLSA Limited - Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. Lisa, just going back to your annual guidance for growth. If I start from down 14%, I think, you have to model double-digit for the next three quarters, which is well above seasonal for you. So I\\'m trying to understand where the growth is coming from.\\\\nObviously you said you expect to gain share, but can you talk about the semi-custom win that\\'s supposed to ramp in the second half, how big that opportunity is, and when exactly you expect those ramps to come in?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let me try to frame it in this way. So if you look overall at our business -- yes, we are projecting full-year revenue growth 2016 compared to 2015 and so we would have to have some significant growth as we go into the second half of the year.\\\\nIndependent of any new designs, the semi-custom business naturally is significantly higher in the second half than in the first half; especially third quarter. It\\'s kind of a peak for the business as we go into the holiday season and we continue to see that phenomenon as our customers are giving us their forecast.\\\\nWe expect the base semi-custom business or the base game consoles to continue unit growth in 2016 versus 2015. There will be some modest ASP decline with that, and then we expect to layer over it some new semi-custom revenue starting in the second half of the year.\\\\nSo from what we see, obviously a lot of things have to happen, but the semi-custom business is one that we\\'ve been able to predict pretty well, given the customer long-term forecasts. And then we have to continue the conversation around the computing and graphics business as we see how the market sorts itself out in the first half of the year going into the stronger second half for the PC business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSrini Pajjuri,  CLSA Limited - Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Then as a follow-up, I think, Lisa, it was last quarter you told us that you were looking to monetize some of the IP properties that you have. Can you give us an update as to -- based on your discussions how you see that opportunity short term and long term? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So on the IP monetization strategy, we will continue to update that quarterly as we go through the process. I think we have had really a good discussion around where to go there. I think there are several different avenues that we believe our IP will be valuable.\\\\nI think on the straight patent side, we\\'ve said before we have 10,000 patents that are over a substantive number of technical areas, including graphics and microprocessors and other semiconductor patents. Those can certainly be licensed or in some cases there may be sales.\\\\nHowever, another area that we think has a lot of potential is the area of technology licensing, where we can help partners accomplish their objectives with both patents and know-how. So we will update the results on that as we go through 2016, but we do believe it\\'s a significant area for us going forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, one for you on I guess what you\\'d call now the base enterprise embedded and semi-custom business. You talked about the gaming SoC business being up on a unit basis, but in 2015, that whole segment was down about 8% year over year.\\\\nSo I guess my question is I know new things are coming in in the back half of this year, but what gives you confidence that today\\'s core business can actually remain anywhere close to flat considering that it fell in 2015?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Ross. So let me give you some more color on the compare, which might help. So on the base EESC business, if you were to look at product revenues of semi-custom game console SoCs, they were actually up a bit. So overall, units were up double-digit percentage. ASP declined, but less than that. So product revenue was up.\\\\nWhat you saw as segment decline was actually legacy revenue from server and embedded. And if you remember, we have some legacy revenue based on some of the older updrawn products that we continue to sell. And that has seen a drop off as well as our DCSS or C Micro business was there in 2014 that we exited in 2015. So that was the year-on-year decline that was there.\\\\nAnd then I think as you go forward to 2016 -- I\\'m not being that specific about the base business, but I will say I think units will be up. And we will have to see exactly how much up and as the markets go, but we certainly don\\'t see it substantially down, if that\\'s what you\\'re implying.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s very helpful. And I guess piggybacking off that to an earlier question -- this time for Devinder on the gross margin side. Correct me if from wrong here, but what I heard as to the answer to the earlier question as to why you\\'re not guiding for the full-year gross margin was partially because the unknown mix dynamic in revenues.\\\\nTo the extent that\\'s true, does that imply that the gross margin delta between the computing and graphics group and the EESC group, even with the new ramps in semi-custom, is likely to remain as wide as it has in the last year or so?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think we have to see how the year unfolds, to be honest. I think Q1, like I said, the guidance at 32%. We need to see mix of product. We have new products being introduced in both the businesses with the new design wins in the second half on the semi-custom side. And then obviously on the CG side, you\\'ve heard us talk about graphics and computing new products kicking in.\\\\nSo from my standpoint, I want to see how it unfolds in terms of the mix of product, mix of the business before getting into the gross margin. But fair to say, as you know, the semi-custom business -- just the way the model works on an NRE standpoint has lower gross margin than the computing and graphics side of the business, so that\\'s a fair statement.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Chris Rolland, FBR & Co.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Rolland,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for the question. On the semi-custom business, I\\'m sure you guys have looked at prior console platform price cuts for customers and their effect on sellthrough. So I\\'d love to know how you are kind of thinking about that and the potential re-acceleration if that were to happen. Do you have any prior metrics you can share with us?\\\\nAnd then also, I think I know the answer, but if there was a platform price cut, should we still expect to slow in linear reduction in your ASPs or might there be something a little bit more aggressive, like a one-time step down?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Okay. So Chris, if you look at the semi-custom cycle -- and again, these cycles are hard to predict -- through this year, through the end of 2015, the game console units are far ahead of the previous cycle. So on the order of 20 million units ahead of the previous cycle.\\\\nWhen you look at the significant price points, I would say there are sub-$300 price points that start accelerating demand. And you saw some of that this holiday season, so that had some impact.\\\\nYour question overall in terms of acceleration -- I think, again, the game console guys know how to do this cost reduction and they\\'ve done it very well. Our price or ASP reductions are not step-function reductions. They end up being pre-negotiated and in line with cost reductions that we have agreed to with our partners.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Rolland,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Very helpful. Also, perhaps you can talk about ASPs in 2016, how do you see them trending with Summit Ridge and server products. And how big a driver is that for top line and for profitability?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think it is very important that we see an improvement in our product mix. And that\\'s something that we\\'ve certainly been striving for in both our mobile products and as we introduce higher-performance desktop and server products we should see that reflected in the ASPs.\\\\nSo the mix of business, focusing on commercial versus sort of the low-end consumer, will help all those things. But when the vendor talks about some of the pluses and minuses on gross margin, it really is our ability to increase and improve that mix in our overall business going forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hans Mosesmann, Raymond James.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. - Analyst    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, a clarification on Zen. You said that you have some design wins already on the server side of that roadmap. Can you give us a sense on what kinds of server wins and what kind of an opportunity you see in terms of market share over the next several years as you come back to the market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Hans, overall on the Zen design wins, we have been engaged very early on with large OEM and cloud providers on the Zen design point and the platforms that would be useful for Zen. So we have closed our first design wins. We are working very closely with these OEM partners to make sure that they bring up their platforms concurrently with our own design validation and testing.\\\\nI think the main message is we are on track with the schedule that we previously discussed in terms of sampling this year. We will introduce first in desktop and so we are having conversations with some of the PC OEMs about getting their platforms ready for desktop. And then we will go into enterprise server first full year in 2017.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. - Analyst    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then as a follow-up, what kind of performance point should we look at your initial Zen in the server space? Is this kind of Xeon E3 Class-type products or E5s? Or maybe you can help with some granularity there if you can?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So we believe that we will be able to address, let\\'s call it, 80% of the server CPU market with our Zen class of products. So that\\'s a very high end, but really the meat of the market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Thank you. I wonder if you can talk about the discrete GPU market business. You were first to market with high-bandwidth memory and saw the benefit of that. Did you see the benefit that you had hoped for? And with your competitor ramping HBM at some point presumably this year, does that blunt the momentum that you\\'ve seen in the GPU side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I would say HBM was a very good technology. I think we got the performance benefit that we expected. It is still at the high end of the cost point range and so that\\'s why we\\'ve introduced it just at the high end.\\\\nI think HBM and all this 2.5D packaging technology is going to be really important over the next three years -- three to five years -- but definitely over the next three years. So I think being first to market, we\\'ve gotten a lot of experience on the technology. We will continue to use high-bandwidth memory in our portfolio. And as the cost goes down, it will give us an opportunity to use it in a broader set of segments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, have you talked about potentially semi-custom products in virtual reality? And to the extent that you have or can, is that going to have the same type of GPU requirement that we\\'ve seen on the PC platform or is it possibly scaled down from that level of performance requirement?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So I think there are opportunities to do custom implementations of GPU for virtual reality. I think the amount of graphics horsepower that\\'s required and perhaps some of the form factors that you want to go into being smaller and more portable would enable you to do that.\\\\nI think it\\'s early to talk specifics, but I think that the general idea that VR has a lot of requirements and doing something custom might be helpful I think is absolutely on the mark.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Steven Chin, UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Lisa, if I could on the graphics roadmap side, with the upcoming Polaris architecture later this year, that\\'s going to come out about four to five quarters after Fiji was released, which is a pretty good improvement in terms of timing or cadence compared to the previous generation.\\\\nSo I guess my question is is this sort of one-year-plus cadence for your GPU roadmap, is this something that can be assumed going forward? And how does that compare relative to the OpEx run rate that Devinder guided for for this year -- is that the right quarterly run rate for [that consisting] that type of graphics roadmap, first of all?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [73]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I think the overall answer is we do believe the cadence of graphics requires annual refreshes, and we\\'re going to invest to enable that. And I think the Polaris launch is significant because it\\'s also a change of process technology, which sometimes can run into other issues. But I think we feel very good about where we are there and you should expect that cadence to continue.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [74]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Perfect. And as my follow-up, just given some of the product announcements on the professional commercial graphics side and some of the design wins you were talking about with Dell, for example, I was wondering if you could help provide any color from your customers in terms of qualitative or even quantitative, potentially, in terms of the opportunity for AMD this year, especially given the macro backdrop -- is there going to be some large step-function up this year from those design wins? Or it pulls the macro potentially play somewhat of a modest headwind for that new opportunity?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So I really view the macro has more of a headwind for the overall PC market. When you talk about professional graphics, I think it\\'s such a specialized market that it is more about the product you offer and is competitive and differentiated enough.\\\\nI think it\\'s fair to say that most of our customers would say the products are actually very good. So the overall product capability and performance is good. Our issue has really been are we investing enough in the software resources to help customers use some of our products.\\\\nSo I think on the professional graphics base, we do believe it\\'s a growth opportunity. I think we\\'re going to continue to invest in some of the software around professional graphics and continue to make steady progress into 2016.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLiz Morali,  AMD - Director, IR    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you.

Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Q2 was a strong quarter for us as we continued to ramp our high-performance product portfolio. Second quarter revenue increased 19% to $1.22 billion, and gross margin improved year-over-year. Importantly, we returned to non-GAAP net income profitability in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our Computing and Graphics segment. \\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we made excellent progress in the quarter and reported operating profitability for the first time in 3 years based on our leadership Ryzen processor and GPU product offerings. The expansion and growing adoption of our Ryzen CPUs, combined with our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year graphics revenue growth, resulted in a 51% increase in Computing and Graphics segment sales year-over-year.\\\\nClient computing revenue increased by strong double-digit percentage from a year ago, driven by a significant ramp and strong sell-through of our Ryzen CPUs in the first full quarter of sales. Our Ryzen family of processors drove a richer mix of shipments, and client ASPs improved significantly from a year ago. All major PC OEMs have announced premium Ryzen-based desktop systems with widespread availability expected for the back-to-school and holiday seasons.\\\\nAs we move into the second half of 2017, we are on track to complete the full family of Ryzen processors, including Ryzen 3 processors targeting the mainstream and value market segments with on-shelf availability later this week; Ryzen ThreadRipper products for the high-end desktop markets with global component channel availability in early August; Ryzen PRO-based offerings targeting the commercial client segment with availability in Q3; and Ryzen Mobile APUs, which will be available for the consumer market later this year.\\\\nIn graphics, GPU revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago with higher unit shipments and ASPs driving growth across our desktop and mobile GPU products. Demand for Radeon RX GPUs was strong in the quarter driven by gaming and cryptocurrency mining.\\\\nIn June, we began the introduction of our Vega GPU architecture with the launch of the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, delivering a powerful professional workstation graphics card designed to tackle demanding design, rendering and machine intelligence workloads. Apple announced that our Radeon Pro Vega product will power the new iMac Pro, a workstation-class product line designed for creators running the most demanding workflows. In addition, Apple also announced expanded iMac offerings, which are powered by the Radeon Pro 500 series.\\\\nWe will launch additional Radeon Vega products at Siggraph next week, expanding further into premium portions of the consumer and professional GPU markets. \\\\nOur investments in GPU compute and Radeon Instinct are continuing to build momentum. We introduced our first Vega-based Radeon Instinct data center products in June. These new GPU accelerators will significantly increase performance, efficiency and ease of implementation for machine learning and high-performance computing workloads. \\\\nWe also showcased a server powered by AMD\\'s EPYC SoC and 4 Radeon Instinct MI25 accelerators, working together to deliver groundbreaking performance of 100 teraflops. Interest and excitement are high as we recently started shipments of our Radeon Instinct MI25 accelerators to strategic data center customers.\\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year and increased 44% sequentially. The sequential revenue gains were primarily based on higher semi-custom product shipments due to seasonality. In addition, we reached an important milestone in the quarter, delivering initial EPYC server revenue.\\\\nIn our semi-custom business, unit shipments were up sequentially and down year-over-year as we enter the fifth year of the current game console sales cycle. This console cycle continues to outpace previous cycles as Sony recently passed a milestone of 60 million PlayStation 4 consoles shipped. Last month, Microsoft announced the new Xbox One X with availability in November. This system will be Microsoft\\'s smallest and most powerful Xbox ever made and will be based on the combination of high-performance CPU and GPU IP that only AMD can provide. \\\\nAs we look at the remainder of the year and given the maturity of the current game console cycle, we expect semi-custom revenue to be down for the full year.\\\\nIn our server business, last month, we launched our EPYC family of high-performance data center processors, reentering the incredibly important $16 billion data center market and setting several new industry performance records. With up to 32 high-performance \\\\\"Zen\\\\\" cores and an unparalleled feature set, our EPYC family of processors deliver greater competitive performance at every price point across a full range of integer, floating point, memory bandwidth and I/O benchmarks and workloads. Our 2-socket and 1-socket EPYC CPUs are designed to deliver industry-leading performance on critical enterprise, cloud and machine intelligence workloads and provide a substantial TCO advantage.\\\\nAt our EPYC launch event, we were joined by more than 20 leading server manufacturers and global ecosystem partners who showcased optimized support and EPYC-optimized platforms. We received compelling endorsements from OEM, cloud providers and mega data center operators, including HP Enterprise, Dell, Baidu, and Microsoft Azure with more than 20 EPYC-based platforms announced at launch. And we expect an additional 20 EPYC platforms to be available in the second half of 2017. With the strong global ecosystem and customer interest we have built around our EPYC processor family, we are on track to reenter the data center market in a major way.\\\\nIn closing, we are very pleased with the trend of our quarterly results and how our products are positioned heading into the back half of the year. Our business foundation and growth opportunities are strong based on our high-performance product portfolio and our expanding customer traction. Given our first half 2017 performance and our visibility into the third quarter, we are happy to report we are progressing ahead of our annual revenue guidance, and we look forward to a strong year overall.\\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of 2017, AMD revenue grew 19% and gross margin expanded on a year-over-year basis, driven by a 51% year-over-year revenue increase in our Computing and Graphics segment. We achieved non-GAAP profitability on both an operating and net basis with net income of $19 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.02. Let me provide more specifics for the quarter.\\\\nGross margin was 33%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year due to a richer product mix and a higher percentage of revenue from our Computing and Graphics segment, driven by the first full quarter of Ryzen processor sales. Operating expenses were $381 million compared to $342 million a year ago. The increase was due primarily to higher graphics and data center R&D-related investments.\\\\nNet licensing gain from our server JV with THATIC was $25 million compared to $26 million a year ago, and we have recognized a total of approximately $140 million of net licensing gain to date. The remaining payments are related to production milestones, and I expect it to occur in 2018 and beyond.\\\\nOperating income was $49 million in the second quarter of 2017, a significant improvement from an operating income of $3 million a year ago.\\\\nSecond quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $30 million, down from $43 million a year ago, primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower debt balance. Net income was $19 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.02 as compared to a net loss of $40 million or loss per share of $0.05 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $84 million compared to $36 million a year ago and $28 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $659 million, up 51% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by demand for our Ryzen desktop processors and graphics processors.\\\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating income was $7 million, the first quarterly operating profit in 3 years, compared to a loss of $81 million a year ago. The significant improvement was primarily due to higher revenue and an improved product mix.\\\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $563 million, down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower semi-custom SoC sales. Revenue was up 44% sequentially due to the seasonal semi-custom ramp. Additionally in the quarter, we reached an important milestone and recognized initial revenue from EPYC data center processor shipments. Operating income was $42 million, down from $84 million a year ago due primarily to lower revenue and higher data center-related R&D investments.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total $844 million at the end of the quarter compared to $943 million at the end of the prior quarter due primarily to changes in working capital, largely driven by wafer purchases in anticipation of stronger revenue growth in the third quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $833 million, down slightly from the prior quarter of $839 million. Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.38 billion. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.74 billion.\\\\nIn Q2, we repurchased $40 million of term debt, utilizing our lower-cost secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow was negative $94 million due primarily to changes in working capital largely driven by wafer purchases.\\\\nTurning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter. We expect revenue to increase approximately 23% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. At the midpoint, this equates to revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. We now expect annual 2017 revenue to increase a mid- to high-teens percentage year-over-year compared to our prior guidance of low double-digit growth, non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 34%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $400 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $28 million and inventory to be down sequentially.\\\\nThird quarter diluted share count for modeling non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately 1.14 billion. This includes shares related to our 2026 convertible senior notes and the warrant held by a Mubadala entity. Additional information regarding diluted share count calculation can be found in the CFO commentary.\\\\nIn closing, Q2 was a strong quarter, and our financial performance continues to improve. As Lisa shared in her remarks, our business continues to strengthen as we ramp new high-performance products and expand our presence in premium markets. We are pleased with the strong growth in revenue coupled with improving gross margin on the back of focused execution, financial discipline and ongoing strategic investments in the business.\\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. Thank you, Devinder, and operator, we\\'re ready for our first question to begin Q&A.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The question is on EPYC, and I\\'m hoping that you can provide us some more color about how the reception is going, how we should think about milestones going forward. And I\\'m wondering if you can tell us about the number of different trials or where you\\'re seeing the most traction and when you would expect this to ship into production environment in the Super 7 cloud guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Mark. Thanks for your question. So we are very pleased with the reception to EPYC. The launch that we did in June was very well received. We had a number of customers as well as partners, OEM providers, ODM guys as well as cloud providers who participated in that. The general reception has been very positive. I would say that interest level is very high. In fact, we\\'re adding additional customer support to really ensure that we help customers get their platforms up and running. In terms of what to expect in the revenue ramp, we started shipping early volume in the second half of June. We would expect that we\\'d continue to ramp that revenue in the second half of the year. We would expect some additional customer announcements in the second half of the year, and then, as we stated with both cloud and enterprise accounts, depending on their qualification cycles, it can take anywhere up to 4 quarters to qualify the parts. But so far, so good. I think very good traction, and we continue to lean in hard on the data center opportunities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s very helpful. And a follow-up if I may. You mentioned crypto as helping the GPU side. That can be a dual-edged sword, and I was wondering if you can help perhaps quantify like what that did to the upside. And is there any way to manage the risk of the minors breaking down their systems and putting it into the secondary market when the currency comes back down?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Mark. So certainly, the overall quarter for graphics was strong. Q2 tends to be seasonally down, and we were up in the quarter. So it was better than seasonal. I would say the better performance was due to 2 things. First of all, we did launch our RX 580 and 570 gaming cards in April, and those cards are very, very well positioned in the market. So they\\'re doing well with gamers. Relative to cryptocurrency, we have seen some elevated demand. If you look at GPUs across the world, the inventory in the channel is actually quite lean, and so we\\'re working on replenishing that inventory. Our priority though really is on our core market, which is the gaming market. And so couple of things that we are certainly doing are we\\'re prioritizing supply towards the gaming market, so you\\'ll see system integrators as well as on some of the major e-tailers, we have bundles with Ryzen and Radeon. And then some of our partners are also offering mining-specific cards that have a different feature set such that we\\'re really segmenting the market between gaming and mining. But it\\'s important to say we didn\\'t have cryptocurrency in our forecast, and we\\'re not looking at it as a long-term growth driver. But we\\'ll certainly continue to watch the developments around the block chain technologies as they go forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Principal and Senior Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I wanted to ask a little bit about the longer-term road map in your businesses across the CPU and GPU side. It occurs to me, and through some of the conversations we\\'ve had, particularly in the enterprise markets of high-end desktop and server, that some of the purchasing decisions made by your customers might be sort of dictated by how confident they are in the long-term road map that you guys are putting together as you move to 7-nanometer versus just the products that you\\'ve launched so far. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the road maps, how they\\'re developing and the progress that the team is seeing on the 7-nanometer front.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Matt. So look, I think the overall road map execution has been very good, very solid. I think our customers see that the Ryzen performance, the EPYC performance on the CPU side and then certainly the Vega performance on the GPU side have met our commitments. And the important thing, particularly in the enterprise market as well as the commercial market, having a road map, a strong road map with multiple generations is important. We stated at our Financial Analyst Day that we\\'re already investing heavily in 7-nanometer. The 7-nanometer will be key for us on both the CPU and the GPU side, and I would say that development is progressing well. We\\'re working with multiple foundries on that. We have multiple design teams that are working, and we expect that, that would give us a strong competitive road map for the next several generations.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Principal and Senior Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And a couple questions, quickly, for Devinder. The -- I guess, the first one is on share count. There was obviously some movement higher in the share count, either the -- in the in-the-money converts. Maybe you could talk us through, if you were modeling maybe your business on a long term, from an earnings power perspective, how would you think about modeling that share count? And then secondly, on the operating expense line, there\\'s plenty to invest in here. But how should we think about that as we move through the year and into next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thank you, Matt. I think on the share count, basically, beyond the basic shares, the dilutive impact come from 3 components. You have the employee equity grants. You have the 75 million share warrant that we issued to Mubadala in 2016. And you have the 101 million shares underlying our $805 million convertible note. The good news is that you start making money and you get beyond inflection point. All of that gets included in dilute share count. So I think given what we have laid out as guidance, in particularly in the Financial Analyst Day, the assumption should be, as you model profitability in the company, those shares get included. We have provided color in the commentary, and for Q3, we are estimating that the total share count is about $1.14 billion (sic) [1.14 billion]. As far as the OpEx is concerned, we are obviously, with the strength in the business, performing stronger. We are making targeted investments, particularly in R&D. We have included and invested in targeted R&D areas. And also, in 2017, I think there are some employee-related performance incentives that are included in our current guidance given the fact that the business is performing stronger than anticipated. Lisa, anything you want to add?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. No, I think you covered it, Devinder. On the investment front, Matt, just to give you a little bit more color on that, I think we see tremendous opportunity in the data center around both CPU and GPU compute, and so we\\'re taking the opportunity with some of the strength in the business to make sure we lean in to those resources and fully pay off the product investments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, one for you first on the client ASPs. I know the Ryzen side, the mix had to go up, and those carry much better ASPs. But the client category as a whole, the ASPs went down. So if you just think about going forward, when do the size of the buckets work, that the Ryzen contribution will be big enough to offset whatever was the headwind against that in the second quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Good question, Ross. When you take a look at our client business, think of it as desktop and mobile, and then within the desktop segment, it\\'s channel and OEM. So Ryzen performed very well. I think the ASP contribution is very evident on the desktop line item. But when we look at where we are in the progression of the Ryzen rollout, we\\'re still in the early innings. So we had our first full quarter of Ryzen desktop in the channel. The OEMs launched their desktop products in about mid-June, and so they just started selling at the end of June. And that will flow through into the second half of the year. And the mobile products are still our legacy products. So you saw the mobile ASPs were down slightly as we went from Q1 to Q2, and that was just a mix on some of the legacy business. But the desktop ASPs were quite strong, and we should expect that, as we go into the second half of the year and we have Ryzen really take off in the OEM sectors as well as once we introduce Ryzen Mobile towards the second half of the year, is when you\\'ll see sort of more of the full portfolio over to Ryzen. Does that help?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It does. And a related follow-up on that is just transitioning those ASP and mix commentaries over to the actual gross margin. The full year revenue guidance is increased again. Just recently, you guys did it at the Analyst Meeting. Now you\\'re doing it again, so that\\'s clearly a positive. It seems like the C&G side of things is what\\'s driving that given your commentary on the game console side being down. So given everything you just said about the mix improving in the back half of the year and the revenues now being higher, I\\'m a little surprised the gross margin guidance didn\\'t change for the year. So if we translate everything you just said, Lisa, to a gross margin dynamic, can you help us kind of make all of that make sense as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I think you summarized the revenue guidance well. I think we see the Computing and Graphics business accelerating on the strength of the new products. We do have a bit of a year-over-year headwind when we compare game consoles. When you look at our Q3 margin guidance, we are certainly up year-over-year 3 points, and so I think that\\'s the strength of the product portfolio. I think as we get into the Q4 guidance, we\\'ll talk more about the margin progression, but the -- what we expected in terms of margin expansion with the premium products is certainly playing out, and that\\'s helping the Q3 guide.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Can you give us some idea of whether your September guidance assumes any meaningful contribution from Vega sales for gaming in the September quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, David. We will be launching Vega actually in a week at Siggraph, and yes, there will be -- Vega will be shipping into gaming, into professional workstations as well as into the GPU compute segment in the third quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And can you update us on your expectations for launch timing of Ryzen notebook chips and if you expect there to be revenues from Ryzen notebook in December?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Ryzen notebook is on track to launch for the holiday platform sales, and so you should see OEMs launching Ryzen Mobile for the holiday period. So yes, we will see revenue in the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research and Senior Research Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          My question, first one was on free cash flow. It\\'s negative again, and for the first half, minus $420 million if my math is right. So Devinder, when does free cash flow turn positive? And then I had a follow-up, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think 2016, if you go back and look at the full year, because of the seasonality of our business, we were positive. From a viewpoint of midpoint of 2017, we do see strength of the business. You\\'re right. Cash is down with the changes in working capital, and it\\'s largely driven by wafer purchases in support of the stronger second half and in particular, the stronger business that we are seeing. We expect cash to be up for the quarter -- this quarter and to be free cash flow positive for the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research and Senior Research Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then my follow-up is, Lisa, on the crypto question that Mark had asked earlier. I\\'m not sure you gave an answer to -- or maybe Mark didn\\'t ask that. Are you seeing follow-on strength from that in the current quarter? And then why -- and we realize it\\'s not a core part of your business. But why or why not this is not similar to what happened in \\'14?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Ambrish. So I think, from an overall standpoint, we see strong demand in graphics for the third quarter. I think that\\'s a mix of a couple things. That\\'s a mix of gaming being seasonally stronger in the third quarter. That\\'s a mix of inventories being very low in the channel, and there is a crypto -- probably a cryptocurrency component as well relative to overall demand. When we look at it as a whole though, we think that the growth in the business is really on the strength of the products and how the design wins, both OEM and -- as well as system integrators, are improving. Now how is it different than sort of a couple of years ago? I think we understand the market much better from the standpoint of the products are significantly stronger. And so if you look at the product portfolio, not just the current sort of Polaris or RX 5-series products but the Vega product coming in, really opens up a larger TAM for us. And we are working with our add-in-board partners to segment the markets in terms of the feature set that go into the cards as well as prioritizing some of the gamer ecosystems, so in terms of system integrator supply as well as bundling and OEM supply. So I think we are doing quite a bit to make sure that we protect against any downside as it relates to cryptocurrency, but overall, I would view it as GPUs are strong. And we see GPUs continuing to be strong, and so it\\'s a great market to be in.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Edward Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director     [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Maybe just as a follow-up to that. Inventories being down going into this quarter and with all your new product ramps, is that -- is it down mainly just because of GPUs? Or is there something else?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think it\\'s -- if you look at the inventory, in fact, if you look at it from my standpoint and the strength of the business, there\\'s revenue growth, we are obviously buying wafers in support of the stronger revenue. Some of the ramp in new products does have an impact on the inventory and obviously, we want to support all of new product ramps. It\\'s down marginally in the quarter, but I expect that in Q3 it will go down. And then we have previously guided down year-over-year, so I expect, when we end the year, it will be down in 2017 compared to 2016 while fully supporting the needs of the business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Edward Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director     [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And is -- I guess for the server side, how do you -- how are you building inventory for that? Or is that a longer design cycle so that you don\\'t really start building inventory?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the server side is -- yes. It\\'s a smaller portion. I mean, the ramp in EPYC, as you probably heard us say, is slower than in other businesses. So from -- if you look at a total inventory, the server portion of inventory is not that huge.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, for my first question, if I go back in history, at one point, AMD had a 20%-plus share in server CPUs, and I appreciate we are far off from that point right now. But I just want to know conceptually what are you doing or can do to recreate those conditions? Or do you think the environment is very different this time around?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Vivek, I think we are actually very pleased with sort of the conditions around the server market for us. I mean, it all starts with a good product or a great product, and so I think the EPYC product performance is very important. But I think the other conditions that are different and perhaps even more favorable than in the past is the fact that the cloud data center guys are making up such a large piece of the market, and they tend to move faster in their qualification cycles given the fact that they have sort of more control of their own software environment. So I think our differentiation is strong. I think we have -- we put out a product that is not only strong on basic CPU performance but also offers much more flexibility in terms of what you can do with memory and I/O. I think that value proposition is recognized by the customer set, so we certainly are looking to ramp the revenue as fast as possible.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And for my follow-up, as you\\'re starting to become more competitive against Intel and NVIDIA, are you seeing any competitive response from them in terms of pricing or features or go-to-market strategy that you might need to respond to?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Obviously, we continue to watch the competitive market. It\\'s been an exciting market. Some would say that, from a product standpoint, there has been a bit of back-and-forth already. We feel good about how our products are positioned not just today but how they will be positioned over the next 18 to 24 months. And so we\\'re going to be very focused on ensuring that we lead with the product message. Of course, there\\'s a go-to-market element and all of that around that, but I think the competitive environment right now is very focused on product competitiveness.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And maybe a quick follow-up on that, Lisa, if I might. When Ryzen initially rolled out, I think some of the benchmarks and -- were not up to par. Have you seen an improvement in that? And as you -- especially as you roll out EPYC, are you seeing the ecosystem come and work around your products, so those benchmarks are not going to be an issue this time around?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I think, Vivek, you\\'re referring to when we initially launched Ryzen 7, there were some games, particularly in 1080p resolution, that were not as good as some of the higher resolution. And I believe we worked around a lot of that. We\\'ve seen game developers, content developers really sort of support the Ryzen ecosystem. I\\'ve actually been very happy with how they\\'ve jumped on the support of it. We have been continuing to improve the ecosystem. So if you look at the motherboards and if you look at the memory capability, they\\'ve significantly improved just in the last 3 or 4 months. I think you\\'ll see, as we go through ThreadRipper launch, which is coming up very shortly, that the Ryzen ecosystem is strong. And as it relates to EPYC, I think the -- very similar comments. I think the ecosystem has been very supportive of the EPYC processor family, and so I don\\'t see that as an issue.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Wonder if you could talk a little bit about -- as we think about EPYC for next year, how do you think we should frame that opportunity? Is it mostly a cloud -- sort of top-tier cloud customer that\\'s going to drive that revenue? Is it sort of next level down of cloud customer going to drive significant revenue and then enterprise next year? I mean, how would you sort of bucket those 3 things in terms of where the EPYC potential lies?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I would say, Joe, we have a broad set of customers that we\\'re engaging with. So definitely, we see top-tier cloud guys very engaged with EPYC and talking about a number of different instances. Microsoft Azure was at our launch event, and Baidu was at our launch event. And we\\'re working with a number of other cloud vendors as well. But we also have a very strong OEM support base as well. So with HPE and Dell putting out a number of platforms with EPYC, I think that will ramp enterprise customers in 2018 as well. So I view it as really both sides of the equation are important for 2018. I think we will see cloud be a little lumpier. So certainly, they tend to buy in stages, so they may be a little bit lumpier. But I think, overall, we are very focused on both cloud and enterprise accounts.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then circling back quickly to the inventory issue that you talked about in graphics. It seems like they\\'re quite lean and in some cases, in shortage. Is that completely a function of demand? Were there any supply issues in the quarter? And how quickly if -- do you foresee that as an issue? And if so, like how quickly do you fix it?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Joe, it was completely a function of demand and demand within lead time. I think from a supply standpoint, we\\'ve had a very strong supply chain across-the-board, across both CPU and GPUs. We are, as I said, in the process of catching up to demand, and so we\\'re certainly increasing some of the production. And that was Devinder\\'s comment about some of the working capital and some of the inventory comments. Overall though, I think we\\'re going into a stronger second half of the year. So it\\'s not unexpected for us to ramp up production. It\\'s just demand was quite strong. Particularly in the April-May time frame is when we saw a spike and take some time to react to those signals.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, can you give us a sense of how EPYC is doing in virtualized environments because there might be some issues regarding compatibility with the other x86 suppliers and how you would go through that process over the next several quarters?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Again, Hans, I think we have been working closely with a number of different customers, including in virtualized environments. We see no particular issues other than just getting their platforms up and running. And so I think we continue to believe EPYC will do very well in those environments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you give us a sense, now that EPYC is out, what the feedback is from your customers, cloud or OEM, regarding your packaging approach in terms of using a multi-chip module type approach versus a monolithic silicon approach?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Hans, actually, the feedback has been actually quite good, and I think the -- what we\\'re able to do -- obviously, it\\'s a decision to make, right? We could have built one big monolithic chip or -- we decided very strategically to build a modular approach because it just gives us so much flexibility when we talk about the combination of CPU cores and I/O. So, so far, so good. I think there is some work to do to make sure that the latencies are appropriately taken care of, and the customers are working with us on that. I think the flexibility is really, really appreciated, particularly when you look at what we can do with single-socket servers as well. So we feel very good about where EPYC is positioned. I think the customer feedback continues to be very strong, and our goal is to get as many platforms out as possible with EPYC this year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, notwithstanding the possibility that you guys beat your revised guidance you just gave today, if you just go by the revised guidance, it\\'s kind of implying calendar fourth quarter revenue down about 10% sequentially, which is about in line with seasonal. Just kind of curious, just given where you are in the product cycle for Ryzen and EPYC, why a seasonal quarter wouldn\\'t be something that you could beat? And I guess, equally important, are you planning to stay profitable in the calendar fourth quarter if it is down seasonal just given the trajectory of OpEx?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So yes, John, let me answer that. When you look at our typical seasonality, as you said, we tend to be down in Q4. Semi-custom is still a large, large piece of our business and semi-custom will peak in Q3. And it will come down in Q4. I also think that we want to be cognizant of the fact that some of the graphics demand that we see might be temporal, so we\\'re not counting on that staying through the full year. We\\'ll see what happens. Frankly, I think we\\'ll see what happens with the whole mining stuff. But I think when you look overall, I think that it shows that the business is strengthening. And so we like the growth very much. Ryzen will continue to grow through the second half. EPYC will continue to grow through the second half. Vega and our GPU business will continue to grow through the second half, and the only headwind that we have is through the game console business just as part of normal seasonality. And then relative to the profit statement...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think it\\'s hard to predict that right now, John. I think if you look at our guidance, as we said, revenue, mid- to high teens, which, from our standpoint, is 16, 17-ish increase. And we\\'ll get to Q4 when we get there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s helpful. And then, Lisa, for my follow-up, R&D ticking up, which is absolutely the right thing to do for the longer-term health of the business, but I\\'m just kind of curious if you could help me understand your sort of R&D priorities. To what extent is this uptick in R&D really to help bolster your position in existing markets versus sort of R&D dollars to go after new markets, whether that be acceleration, machine learning or autonomous driving? How should I think about that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I think there are a couple points, John, that I want to make sure that we\\'re clear about. Although OpEx is going up and R&D is going up, we\\'re doing it in a very thoughtful fashion. And so staying within the confines of the business model is really important. And as Devinder said earlier, our model that we laid out at Financial Analyst Day for 2017 has us, let\\'s call it, at approximately 31% ER, and we\\'re going to stay within that model for sure. Now relative to priorities in R&D, it is very much focused on sort of the new growth areas for us, very much focused on data center and very much focused on GPU computes around machine learning and sort of the entire compute space on the GPU side. It is fairly incremental in terms of adding things like customer support, field application engineering, software support given that we\\'re familiarizing people with our architecture. So I think it\\'s good. We\\'re happy that the business affords us the ability to increase R&D in this time frame, and we\\'re using it to accelerate our growth in these high-margin markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Perhaps, Lisa, when you look at the EPYC, I know you said 20 customers already and then 20 more in the second half. Do you think that gets to 5% of your revenues, just the EPYC side of your revenues as you look at the third quarter? And should we assume pretty incrementally [about --] not the 50% margins on your EPYC product, especially as it goes in the data center side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So Vijay, without getting too granular about percentage of EPYC revenue, I think what we\\'ve said is our target for EPYC, we sort of have -- the midterm target is to get back to double-digit market share, so over 10%. We think that we have a product and a customer set in an environment that does support that. It will take longer than this year to get there. So I think this is a multiple-quarter ramp for us. But in terms of how we\\'ve laid out the business model, I mean, that\\'s all contemplated sort of in our overall growth model for 2017. As it relates to margins, again, without being very specific, I would say the EPYC margins are highly accretive even at our current sort of pricing, which offers, I would say, significant value to the customer. I think it also gives us significant credit for the capability of the product. And so the margins are accretive to our business model.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Very helpful. Just on the Radeon Instinct side, too, can you give us some similar commentary on how you see in terms of customer adoption and what the response has been similar to EPYC?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, yes. The Radeon Instinct similarly has a lot of interest from the marketplace, a number of different applications. We started shipping actually in July to some strategic data center customers. We see that interest continue to ramp. There, I think it is -- this is definitely a lumpy business. And so it goes, as a cloud guy puts on a new instance, you would see a larger buy, and that\\'s the way it would work. But again, very good market. I think we\\'re in the very early part of the growth trajectory for AMD in these markets, and we\\'ll continue to invest and work closely with customers to ramp those platforms.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I just want to follow up on the -- your comments on the cryptocurrency market. Just curious what\\'s your visibility into whether someone -- obviously, they buy a dedicated card. It would be easy to track. Just your visibility on the back end as to where the strength in the overall GPU market is coming from. You mentioned it as a third factor, I think, in September, but then mentioned it may impact December and if you can just talk about in that full year guide, are you factoring in any contribution in December?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We\\'re being conservative in our estimates for what will happen as we get into the fourth quarter. I think the visibility is not -- it\\'s anyone\\'s guess at this moment. However, I think what we are doing very clearly is prioritizing sort of the core customer set so that we\\'re segmenting the market. You can never segment it perfectly, but I think we are segmenting it well. And we continue to be very closely in tune with our partners and how this develops. And my expectation is that there will be a leveling off of the demand at some point. And as we fill the channel, that will become clear in what the level-off point is. But right now as we said, the channel inventories are very low, and so it\\'s hard to call the absolute demand. And we\\'re ensuring that we\\'re not overcalling the demand.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then just a question for Devinder. The OpEx step-up in September, it\\'s hard to tell from the full year guide, 31% can round a bunch of different ways. Just curious if you expect any follow-through in that increase in R&D into the December quarter? And then if you could just mention also timing of the JV payment. Obviously, you\\'re not getting any in the back half of this year. Maybe you could talk about the milestones into next year and when those should come back as offsets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Let me take the JV one first. I mean, as we said in the commentary in my prepared remarks, $140 million licensing gained on the THATIC server JV to date. We got $52 million this year, and there\\'s nothing more this year. The remaining payments are based on some production-related milestones, and those are in 2018 and beyond. And we\\'ll update that as we get closer. As far as the OpEx is concerned, I think we\\'ve said a lot, and we stand by what we said. We\\'ll manage within our guidance of expense-to-revenue ratio of approximately 31% for the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We\\'ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\\'d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Thank you very much, operator. We appreciate everyone being with us today.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter, with growth across all our platforms, led by gaming and data center. Q1 revenue reached a record $3.21 billion, up 66% year-on-year, up 10% sequentially, and above our outlook of $2.9 billion. Once again, all measures of profitability set records, with GAAP gross margins at 64.5%, operating margins at 40.4%, and net income at $1.24 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 77% from last year, to $2.77 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 33% to $442 million.\\\\nLet\\'s start with our gaming business. Revenue was $1.72 billion, up 68% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. Demand was strong and broad-based across regions and products. The gaming market remains robust and the popular Battle Royale genre is attracting a new wave of gamers to the GeForce platform. We also continued to see demand from upgrades, with about 35% of our installed base currently on our Pascal architecture. The launch of popular titles, like Far Cry 5 and FANTASY -- FINAL FANTASY XV, continued to drive excitement in the quarter. Gamers are increasingly engaging in social gameplay and gaming is rapidly becoming a spectator sport, while the production value of games continues to increase. This dynamic is fueling a virtuous cycle that expands the universe of gamers and drives a mix shift to higher end GPUs.\\\\nAt the recent Game Developers Conference, we announced our real-time ray-tracing technology, NVIDIA RTX. Ray tracing is movie-quality rendering technique that delivers lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows. It has long been considered the Holy Grail of graphics and we\\'ve been working on it for over 10 years. We look forward to seeing amazing, cinematic games that take advantage of this technology come to the market later this year, with the pipeline building into next year and beyond. And we expect RTX, as well as other new technologies like 4K and virtual reality, to continue driving gamers\\' requirements for higher GPU performance.\\\\nWhile supply was tight earlier in the quarter, the situation is now easing. As a result, we are pleased to see that channel prices for our GPUs are beginning to normalize, allowing gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter to get their hands on the new GeForce GTX at a reasonable price. Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business, at $289 million. As a result, we could protect the vast majority of our limited gaming GPU supply for use by gamers. Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about 1/3 of its Q1 level.\\\\nGaming notebooks also grew well, driven by an increasing number of thin and light notebooks based on our Max-Q design. And Nintendo Switch contributed strongly to year-on-year growth, reflecting that platform\\'s continued success.\\\\nMoving to data center. We had another phenomenal quarter, with revenue of $701 million, up 71% year-on-year, up 16% sequentially. Demand was strong in all market segments, and customers increasingly embraced our GPUs and CUDA platform for high-performance computing and AI. Adoption of our Volta architecture remained strong across a wide range of verticals and customers. In the public cloud segment, Microsoft Azure announced general availability of Tesla V100 instances, joining Amazon, IBM and Oracle. And Google Cloud announced that the V100 is now publicly available in beta. Many other hyperscale and consumer Internet companies also continued their ramp of Volta, which delivers 5x the deep learning performance of its predecessor, Pascal. Volta has been chosen by every major cloud provider and server maker, reinforcing our leadership in AI deep learning.\\\\nIn high-performance computing, strength from the broad enterprise vertical more than offset the ramp down of major supercomputing projects such as the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s Summit System. We see a strong pipeline across a number of vertical industries from manufacturing to oil and gas, which has helped sustain the trajectory of high-performance computing next quarter and beyond.\\\\nTraction is also increasing in AI inference. Inference GPU shipments to cloud service providers more than doubled from last quarter. And our pipeline is growing into next quarter. We dramatically increased our inference capabilities with the announcement of the TensorRT 4 AI Inference Accelerator Software at our recent GPU Technology Conference in San Jose. TensorRT 4 accelerates deep learning inference up to 190 times faster than CPUs for common applications such as computer vision, neural machine translation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis and recommendation systems. It also dramatically expands the use cases prepared with the prior version. With TensorRT 4, NVIDIA\\'s market reach has expanded to approximately 30 million hyperscale servers worldwide.\\\\nAt GTC, we also announced other major advancements in our deep learning platform. We doubled the memory of Tesla V100 to 32 GB DRAM, which is a key enabler for customers building large neural networks through larger data sets. And we announced a new GPU interconnect fabric called NVIDIA NVSwitch. (inaudible) 16 Pascal V100 GPUs at a speed of 2.4 terabytes per second, or 5x faster than the best PCIe switch. We also announced our DGX-2 system, which leverages these new technologies and its updated, fully-optimized software stack to deliver a 10x performance boost beyond last year\\'s DGX. DGX-2 is the first single server capable of delivering 2 petaflops of computational power. We are seeing strong interest from both hyperscale and (inaudible) customers, and we look forward to bringing this technology to cloud customers later this year.\\\\nAt our Investor Day in March, we updated our forecast for the data center and the rest of the market. We see the data center opportunity as very large, fueled by growing demand for accelerated computing and applications ranging from AI (inaudible) multiple market segments and vertical industries. We estimate the TAM at $50 billion by 2023, which extends our previous forecast of $30 billion by 2020. We see strong momentum in the adoption of our accelerated computing platform and the expansion of our development ecosystem to serve this rapidly growing market. About 8,500 attendees registered for GTC, up 18% from last year. CUDA downloads have continued to grow, setting a fresh record in the quarter. And our total number of developers is well over 850,000, up 72% from last year.\\\\nMoving to pro visualization. Revenue grew to $251 million, up 22% from a year ago and accelerating from last quarter, driven by demand for real-time rendering as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. Strength extended across several key industries, including public sector, health care and retail. Key wins in the quarter included Columbia University, using high-end Quadro GPUs for AI, and Siemens, using them for CT and ultrasound solutions.\\\\nAt GTC, we announced the Quadro GV100 GPU with NVIDIA RTX technology, capable of delivering real-time ray tracing to the more than 25 million artists and designers throughout the world. RTX makes computational intensive ray tracing possible in real time when running professional design and content creation applications. This allows media and entertainment professionals to see and interact with their creations with correct light and shadows and do complex renders up to 10x faster than a GPU -- a CPU alone. And the NVIDIA OptiX AI denoiser built into RTX delivers almost 100x the performance of CPUs for real-time noise-free rendering. This enabled customers to replace racks of servers in traditional render farms with GPU servers at 1/5 the cost, 1/7 the space, and 1/7 the power.\\\\nLastly, automotive. Revenue grew 4% year-on-year to a record $145 million. This reflects the ongoing transition from our infotainment business to our growing autonomous vehicle development and production opportunities around the globe.\\\\nAt GTC and Investor Day, we made key product announcements on the advancement of autonomous vehicles and established a total addressable market opportunity of 60 billion by 2035. We believe that every vehicle will be autonomous one day. By 2035, this will encompass 100 million autonomous passenger vehicles and 10 million robo-taxis.\\\\nWe also introduced NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a platform that will help car companies, carmakers, tier 1 suppliers, and others developing autonomous vehicles test and validate their systems in a virtual world across a wide range of scenarios before deploying on the road. Each year, 10 trillion miles are driven around the world. Even if test cars can eventually cover millions of miles, that\\'s an insignificant fraction of all the scenarios that require testing to create a safe and reliable autonomous vehicle. DRIVE Constellation addresses this challenge by (inaudible) cars to safely drive billions of miles in virtual reality.\\\\nThe platform has 2 different servers. The first is loaded with GPUs and simulates the environment that the car is driving in, as in a hyper-real video game. The second contains the NVIDIA DRIVE Pegasus Autonomous Vehicle Computer, which possesses the simulated data, as if it were coming from the sensors of a car driving on the road. Real-time driving command from the DRIVE Pegasus are fed back to the simulation for true hardware-in-the-loop verification. Constellation will enable autonomous vehicle industry for safety test and validate their AI self-driving systems in ways that are not practical or possible with on-road testing.\\\\nWe also extended our product roadmap to include our next-generation DRIVE Autonomous Vehicle Computer. We have created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of autonomous driving, from traffic jams, pilots, to level 5 robo-taxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are now using NVIDIA\\'s automotive platform. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for autonomous driving business.\\\\nNow moving to the rest of the P&L. Q1 GAAP gross margins were 64.5% and non-GAAP was 64.7%, records that reflect continued growth in our value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $773 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $648 million, up 25% year-on-year. We continue to invest in key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, AI and automotive. GAAP net income was a record $1.24 billion and EPS was $1.98, up 145% and 151% respectively from a year earlier. Some of the expenses (inaudible) by a tax rate of 5% compared to our guidance of 12%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.29 billion and EPS was $2.05, both up 141% from a year ago, reflecting the revenue strength as well as gross margins and operating margin expansion on slightly lower tax. Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels at $1.45 billion. Capital expenditures were $118 million.\\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $3.1 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.6% and 63.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $810 million and $685 million, respectively. GAAP...\\\\n(technical difficulty)\\\\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website.\\\\nIn closing, I\\'d like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community. We\\'ll be presenting at the JPMorgan Technology Conference next week on May 15, and at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5. We will also hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders online on May 16.\\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. Simona and I are here in Santa Clara and Jensen is dialing in from the road. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First, I had a question on gaming seasonality. It\\'s usually down pretty decently in Q1. It was obviously flat this time as you were trying to fill up the channel. Now that\\'s done. I was just wondering on with the supply dynamics -- supply-demand dynamics as well as like any thoughts on crypto might mean for typical -- the seasonality in the Q2 versus what would be typical or what would usually be down -- or usually be up pretty decently? How are you looking at that? And there\\'s a question for Colette.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, why don\\'t you start on the question for Stacy, and I\\'ll follow-up afterwards, after you speak.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Stacy, so let\\'s see. Q1, as you probably know, Fortnite and PUBG are global phenomenons. The success of Fortnite and PUBG are just beyond, beyond comprehension, really. Those 2 games, a combination of Hunger Games and Survivor, has just captured imaginations of gamers all over the world. And we saw the uptick and we saw the demand on our GPUs from all over the world. Surely, there was scarcity as you know. Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter, and it drove prices up. And I think that a lot of the gamers weren\\'t able to buy into the new GeForces as a result. And so we\\'re starting to see the prices come down. We monitor spot pricing every single day around the world. And the prices are starting to normalize. It\\'s still higher than where they should be. And so obviously, the demand is still quite strong out there. But my sense is that there\\'s a fair amount of pent-up demand still. Fortnite is still growing in popularity. PUBG is doing great. And then, we\\'ve had some amazing titles coming out. And so my sense is that the overall gaming market is just really -- is super healthy. And our job is to make sure that we work as hard as we can to get supply out into the marketplace. And hopefully, by doing that, the pricing will normalize and the gamers can buy into their favorite graphics card at a price that we hope they can get it at. And so I think there\\'s a fair -- so I mean, the simple answer to your question is Fortnite and PUBG. And the demand is just really great. They did a great job.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No wonder -- Colette had talked about the inference doubling in sales quarter-over-quarter with cloud. Can you just talk about where you\\'re seeing the early applications for inference? Is that sort of as-a-service business? Or are you looking at internal cloud workloads? And just any color you can give us on where you guys are sitting in the inference space.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Joe, so as you know, there are 30 million servers around the world. And they were put in place during the time when the world didn\\'t have deep learning. And now with deep learning and with machine learning approaches, the accuracy of prediction, the accuracy of recommendation has jumped so much that just about every Internet service provider in the world that has a lot of different customers and consumers are jumping onto this new software approach. And in order to take this newer network -- and the software that\\'s written by deep learning, these frameworks, are massive software. The way to think about these deep neural nets is, it has millions and millions and millions of parameters in it, and these networks are getting larger every year. And they\\'re enormously complex. And the output of these neural nets had to be optimized for the computing platform that it targets. How you would optimize the neural network for a CPU or a GPU is very, very different. And how you optimize for different neural networks, whether it\\'s image recognition, speech recognition, natural language translation, recommendation systems, all of these networks have different architectures, and the optimizing compiler that\\'s necessary to make the neural network run smoothly and fast is incredibly complex. And so that\\'s why we created TensorRT. That\\'s what TensorRT is. TensorRT is an optimizing graph neural network compiler. And it optimizes for our -- each one of our platforms. And each -- even each one of our platforms has very different architectures. For example, we invented recently -- reinvented the GPU and it\\'s called the Tensor Core GPU, and the first of its kind is called Volta. And so TensorRT 4.0 now supports, in addition to image recognition, all of the different types of neural network models. The answer to your question is internal consumption. Internal consumption is going to be the first users. Video recognition, detecting for inappropriate video, for example, all over the world, making recommendations from the videos that you search or the images that you\\'re uploading, all of these types of applications are going to require an enormous amount of computation.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, I have 2 questions about the data center. One from a growth, and the second, from a competition perspective. So from the growth side, you guys are doing about, say, $3 billion or so annualized, but you have outlined a market that could be $50 billion. What needs to happen for the next inflection? Is it something in the market that needs to change? Is it something in the product set that needs to? How do you go and address that $50 billion market, right? Because you\\'re only a few percent penetrated today in that large market. So what needs to change for the next inflection point? And then, on the competition side, as you are looking at that big market, how should we think about competition that is coming from some of your cloud customers, like a Google announcing a TPU 3 or perhaps others looking at other competing technologies? So any color on both sort of how you look at growth and competition would be very helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Vivek. First of all, at its core, this is something we all know now, that CPU scaling has really slowed. And if you think about the several hundred billion dollars worth of computer equipment that\\'s been installed in the cloud, in data centers all over the world, and as these applications for machine learning and high-performance computing approaches come along, the world needs a solution. CPU scaling has slowed. And so here\\'s the approach that we pioneered 1.5 decades ago called GPU computing. And we\\'ve been determined to continue to advance it during this time because we saw this day coming and we really believed that it was going to end. I mean, you can\\'t deny physics. And so we find ourselves in a great position today. And as Colette already mentioned, we have something close to 1 million developers on this platform now. It is incredibly fast, speeding up CPUs by 10, 20, 50, 100x, 200x sometimes, depending on the algorithm. It\\'s everywhere. The software ecosystem is just super rich. And as Colette mentioned, that there is already almost 1 billion -- 1 million developers around the world, that\\'s grown 70% year-over-year. And so I think at the core, it\\'s about the fact that the world needs a computing approach going forward. With respect to the -- our ability to address the TAM, there are 3 major segments. There\\'s more than that, but there\\'s 3 major segments. One is, of course, training for deep learning. The other is inferencing, and TRT 4 is intended to do just that, to expand our ability to address all of the different types of algorithms, machine learning algorithms that are now coming -- that are running in the data centers. The third is high-performance computing, and that\\'s molecular dynamics, to medical imaging, to earth sciences, to energy sciences. The type of algorithms that are being run in supercomputers all over the world is expanding. And we\\'re doing more and more of our product designs in virtual reality. We want to simulate our products and simulate its capabilities in simulation in this computer rather than build it in the beginning. And then, the last category would be graphics virtualization. We\\'ve taken with GRID and our Quadro virtual workstation and now with Quadro -- with NVIDIA RTX, we turned the data center into a powerful graphic supercomputer. And so these are the various applications and segments of data center that we see. I think, in the case of training, we\\'re limited by the number of deep learning experts in the world. And that\\'s growing very quickly. The frameworks are making it easier. There\\'s a lot more open source and open documentation on sharing of knowledge. And so the number of AI engineers around the world is growing super fast. The second is inference. And I\\'ve already talked about that. It\\'s really limited by our optimizing compilers and how we can target these neural network models to run on our processors. And if we could do so, we\\'re going to save our customers enormous amounts of money. We speed up applications, we speed up these neural network models 50x, 100x, 200x over a CPU. And so the more GPUs they buy, the more they\\'re going to save. And high-performance computing, the way to think about that is, I think, at this point, it\\'s very clear that going forward, supercomputers are going to get built with accelerators in them. And because of our long-term dedication to CUDA and our GPUs for acceleration, of all these codes and the nurturing of the ecosystem, I think that we\\'re going to be -- we\\'re going to do super well in the supercomputing world. And so these are the different verticals. With respect to competition, I think it all starts with the core. And the core is that the CPU scaling has slowed. And so the world needs another approach going forward. And surely, because of our focus on it, we find ourselves in a great position. Google announced GPU 3 and it\\'s still behind our Tensor Core GPU. Our Volta is our first generation of a newly reinvented approach of doing GPUs. It\\'s called Tensor Core GPUs. And we\\'re far ahead of the competition. And -- but more than that, more than that, it\\'s programmable. It\\'s not one function. It\\'s programmable. Not only is it faster, it\\'s also more flexible. And as a result of the flexibility, developers could use it in all kinds of applications, whether it\\'s medical imaging or weather simulations or deep learning or computer graphics. And as a result, our GPUs are available in every cloud and every data center, everywhere on the planet. And which developers need, so that accessibility so that they could develop their software. And so I think that on the one hand, it\\'s too simplistic to compare a GPU to just one of the many features that\\'s in our Tensor Core GPU. But even if you did, we\\'re faster. We support more frameworks. We support all neural networks. And as a result, if you look at GitHub, there are some 60,000 different neural network research papers that are posted that runs on NVIDIA GPUs. And it\\'s just a handful for the second alternative. And so it just kind of gives you a sense of the reach and the capabilities of our GPUs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, I had a question regarding your decision to pull the plug on your GeForce partner program. I think most of us read your blog from last Friday, I think it was. So we understand the basic background. But if you can describe what led to this decision, and perhaps talk a little bit about the potential implications, if any, in terms of your ability to compete or gain share, that will be really helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks for the question, Toshiya. At the core, the program was about making sure that gamers who buy graphics cards knows exactly the GPU brand that\\'s inside. And the reason for that is because we want gamers to -- the gaming experience of a graphics card depends so much on the GPU that is chosen. And we felt that using one gaming brand, a graphics card brand and interchanging the GPU underneath causes it to be less -- causes it to be more opaque and less transparent for gamers to choose the GPU brand that they wanted. And most of the ecosystem loved it. And some of the people really disliked it. And so instead of all that distraction, we\\'re doing so well, and we\\'re going to continue to help the gamers choose the graphics cards like we always have, and things will sort out. And so we decided to pull the plug because the distraction was unnecessary and we had too much good stuff to go do.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nUnidentified Audience Member    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is (inaudible) calling in for C.J. Muse. So I had a question on HPC. TSMC, on their recent call, raised their accelerator attach rate forecast in HPC to 50% from mid-teens. So I would love to get further details on what exactly NVIDIA is doing to software services, et cetera, that\\'s kind of creating this competitive positioning in HPC and AI, basically. And then, if I could ask a follow-up, basically, in benchmarks. So there\\'s been some news on AI benchmarks, whether it\\'s Stanford\\'s DAWNBench, et cetera. So I would love to get your thoughts on, a, the current state of benchmarks for AI workloads. And b, the relative positioning of ASICs versus GPUs, especially as we move towards newer networks like RNN and GAN, et cetera.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks for the question. HPC. First of all, at the core, CPU scaling has stalled and it\\'s reached the limits of physics. And the world needs another approach to go forward. We created the GPU computing approach 1.5 decades ago, and I think at this point, with the number of developers jumping on, the number of applications that\\'s emerging, it\\'s really clear that the future of HPC has accelerated. And our GPU approach, because of its flexibility, because of its performance, because of the value that we create, that as a result of the throughput of a data center, we save people so much money just in cables alone. Oftentimes, more than pays for the GPUs that they buy. And the reason for that is because the number of servers is reduced dramatically. And so I think the future of HPC is about acceleration, and the NVIDIA CUDA GPUs are really in a great position to serve this vacuum that\\'s been created. With respect to benchmarks, you might have seen that earlier this week, we released 3 speed records. The fastest single GPU, the fastest single node -- single computer node. A definition of a computer node is something that fits in a box that runs one operating system, one node. And one instance, one cloud instance. We now have the fastest speed record for 1 GPU, 1 node and 1 instance. And so we love benchmarks. Nothing is more joyful than having a benchmark to demonstrate your leadership position. And in the world of deep learning, the number of networks is just growing so fast because the number of different applications that deep learning is able to solve is really huge. And so you need a lot of software capability and you\\'re -- the versatility of your platform needs to be great. We also have a lot of expertise in the company and software. I mean, NVIDIA is really a full-stack computing company. From architecture, to system software, to algorithms, to applications, we have a great deal of expertise across the entire stack. And so we love these complicated benchmarking -- benchmarks that are out there, and I think this is a great way for us to simplify our leadership position. I think long term, the number of networks that are going to emerge will continue to grow. And so the flexibility of ASICs is going to be its greatest downfall. And if someone were to create a general-purpose parallel accelerating processor like ours, and had it designed to be incredibly good at deep learning, like recently what we did with our Tensor Core GPU, which is a reinvented GPU, and Volta is the first one, I -- it\\'s going to be hard. It\\'s going to be expensive, and we\\'ve been doing it for a long time. And so I think this is a -- it\\'s a great time for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, I wanted to ask on the inference side [about edge inference]. And beyond autos, when you look at sizing that TAM, what are the other big areas that you think you can penetrate with GPUs and inference, besides auto?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Blayne. The largest inference opportunity for us is actually in the cloud and the data center. That\\'s the first great opportunity. The reason for that is there\\'s just an explosion in the number of different types of neural networks that are available. There are image recognition, there\\'s video sequencing, there\\'s video -- there\\'s recommender systems. There\\'s speech recognition, speech synthesis, natural language understanding. There\\'s just so many different types of neural networks that are being created. And creating one ASIC that can be adapted to all of these different types of networks is just a real challenge. And by the time that you create such a thing, it\\'s called a Tensor Core GPU, which is what we created. And so I think the first opportunity for us in -- large-scale opportunity will be in the data center and the cloud. The second will be in vertical markets. The vertical market that you mentioned is self-driving cars. And we see a great opportunity in autonomous vehicles, both in the creation of autonomous vehicles. And I mentioned that before, between now and the time that we ramp our AV computers we call DRIVE, we\\'re going to be selling a whole lot of servers so that the companies could develop their neural network models for their self-driving cars as well as simulating the virtual reality -- in virtual reality, there are various test drives as well as testing their neural network and their self-driving car stack against billions and billions of miles of saved-up prerecorded videos. And so in the vertical markets, we\\'re going to see inference both in the data center for developing the self-driving car stack as well as in the self-driving cars themselves. Now in the self-driving cars, the ASPs for level 2 could be a few hundred dollars to a level 5 self-driving car, taxi or driverless taxi being a few thousand dollars. And I expect that driverless taxis will start going to market about 2019, and self-driving cars probably somewhere between 2020 and 2021. And I think the size of the market is fairly well modeled. And the simple way to think about that is, I believe that every single -- everything that moves someday will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. And so the 100 million cars, the countless taxis, all the trucks, all the agriculture equipment, all the pizza delivery vehicles, you name it, everything is going to be autonomous. And the market opportunity is going to be quite large. And that\\'s the reason why we\\'re so determined to go create that market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Tim Arcuri with UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I actually wanted to go back to the question about seasonality for gaming in June. Normal seasonal sounds like it\\'s up mid-teens for June in gaming. But obviously, the comps are skewed a little bit because of the channel restock and the crypto stuff. So does the guidance for June assume that gaming is better or worse than that mid-teens normal seasonal?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We are expecting the -- we are expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality, if I understand your question. It should be -- we\\'re expecting Q2 to be better than Q1 and we\\'re expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality. Did that answer your question?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Semiconductor Capital Equipment & Specialty Semiconductor Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have a question for Colette. Colette, first thank you for breaking out crypto sales in the OEM line and guide for us. I have a question on your gross margins. Your gross margins have been expanding on product mix, despite component pricing headwinds on the DRAM side. When do you expect component pricing to become a tailwind to your gross margin?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks so much for the question. When you think about our gross margins, just over this last quarter, as you know, we were working on stabilizing the overall supply that was out there in the market for consumer GPUs. We benefited from that with a higher gross margin as we filled and completed that. You\\'ve seen us absorb a significant amount of the component pricing changes that we have seen, particularly around the memory. We\\'re not here to be able to forecast, generally, when those pricing of those components will stabilize. But we believe in terms of the value added that our platforms provide, the components are an important part of finishing that. But I think we have a tremendous amount more value that we are adding in terms of the software on top of our platforms, which is enabling our gross margins.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          My question is the progress on the deployment of Volta into the cloud service providers. You talked in your prepared remarks about 5 deployments, including the Google beta. Can you talk about the -- how soon we can expect to see some of those remaining deployments? And of those already launched, how far are they along? What -- I guess, to say proverbially, what inning are we in, in these deployments?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So first of all, Volta is a reinvented GPU. Volta is the world\\'s first GPU that has been designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it the Tensor Core GPU. It has still retained all of the flexibilities of all -- everything that CUDA has ever run is backwards compatible with everything that runs on CUDA. But it has new architectures designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it a Tensor Core GPU. And that\\'s the reason why it has all of the benefits of our GPU, but none of the ASICs can catch up to it. And so Volta is really a breakthrough. We\\'re going to be very successful with Volta. Every cloud will have it. The initial deployment is for internal consumption. Volta has been shipping to the cloud service -- cloud providers, the Internet service companies, for the vast majority of last quarter, as you guys know. And they\\'re using it internally. And now they\\'re starting to open up Volta for external consumption, their cloud customers. And they are moving as fast as they can. And my expectation is that you\\'re going to see a lot more coming online this quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had a question about the DGX family of products. Our own fieldwork is indicating very positive reception for DGX. And I was wondering, Jensen, if can you help us understand, the high-growth we\\'ve seen in the data center business, to what extent is that being driven by the DGX? And what, when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the back half of the year, is that -- is it something that kind of layers on top of DGX? Does DGX-2 layer top of DGX? Are they (inaudible) segments, that you\\'re kind of segmenting the market with these different products? Any color on how to think about those 2 products are -- should be -- would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Colette, could you give me a brief version of that? It was kind of crackling on my side.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m going to ask the operator if they could ask for the question again because it was also, on our side, a little crackly.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Mark, your line is open. Please restate your question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Can you hear me better now?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Much better, Mark.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Sorry about that. I\\'m at the airport. So the question was on the DGX family of products. Our own fieldwork indicates very positive reception. I was wondering, Jensen, if you could help us understand the high-growth you\\'ve seen in the data center market. How much is DGX contributing to that? And then, when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the second half of the year, how do we think about DGX-1? Does it replace DGX -- the original DGX? Or you\\'re going after different segments? Or do they layer on top of one another? Any color on that would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I see. Thank you. DGX-2 and DGX-1 will both be in the market at the same time. And DGX is a few hundred million dollar business. It\\'s -- it was introduced last year. So its growth rate is obviously very high. It\\'s designed for enterprises where they don\\'t -- they need to have their computers on-premise, but they don\\'t want to build a supercomputer and they don\\'t have the expertise to do so. And they would like to pull a supercomputer out of a box, plug it in, and start doing supercomputing. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises. It\\'s designed for car companies. It\\'s designed for health care companies doing life sciences work or medical imaging work. We recently announced a project called Project Clara, which basically takes medical imaging equipment, virtualizes them, containerizes the software, and turns it into a -- and most medical imaging equipment today are computational and they -- a lot of them run on NVIDIA CUDA anyways. And so we put that -- we can put that into the data center, we can virtualize their medical instruments and it gives them the opportunity to upgrade the millions of instruments that are out in the marketplace today. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises and we\\'re seeing great success there. It\\'s really super easy to use and it comes with direct support from HPC and AI researchers at NVIDIA. And the answer to your question at the end is, both of them will be in the marketplace at the same time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m actually going to go with a more nitty-gritty question just on the financial side, just to make sure I\\'m understanding this right. So the OEM beat was pretty material, given a lot of crypto revenue. Is it still the case that OEM is materially lower gross margin than your corporate average at this time?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. I\\'ll take that question. Generally, our OEM business can be a little bit volatile. Because remember, OEM business incorporates our mainstream GPUs as well as our Tegra integrated. So we have development platforms that we sell on some of the Tegra piece of it. But they are slightly below, and I think you can go back and refer to our discussion at Investor Day as there\\'s a slide there that talks about those embedded pieces and them being below. So yes, you\\'re correct. Again, a very small part of our business right now.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So your competitor thinks that just 10% of their sales were from crypto, or like $150 million, $160 million. And you guys did almost $300 million there. And perhaps I think there could actually be some in gaming as well, which would imply that you guys have 2/3 or more of that market? So I guess, what\\'s going on there? Is there a pricing dynamic that\\'s allowing you to have such share there? Or do you think it\\'s your competitors that don\\'t know what\\'s actually being sold to miners versus gamers? Why such implied share in that market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, we try to as transparently reveal our numbers as we can. And so the thing that we -- our strategy is to create a SKU that allows the crypto miners to fulfill their needs, and we call it CMP, and to the -- as much as possible, fulfill their demand that way. Sometimes it\\'s just not possible because the demand is too great. And -- but we try to do so. And we try to keep the miners on the CMP SKUs as much as we can. And so I\\'m not exactly sure how other people do it, but that\\'s the way we do it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Andrew Ellis,  B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division - Senior MD & Director of Research    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, I just wanted to come back to an announcement that you made at GTC with ray tracing. Because the technology looked like it was very high fidelity, and I think you noted at that time that it was very computationally intensive. So the question is, as we think about the gaming business and the potential for ray tracing to enter that platform group, what does it mean for dynamics that we\\'ve seen in the past, for example, the ability to really push the high end of the market with high-end capability, 1070. Ti launched late last year. It was very successful. Does this give you further flexibility for those types of launches as you bring exciting and very high-end technology to market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I appreciate it. NVIDIA RTX is the biggest computer graphics invention in the last 15 years. It took us 1 decade to do. We literally worked on it continuously for 1 decade. And to put it into perspective, it\\'s basically film rendering, cinematic rendering, except it\\'s in real time. It merges the style of computer graphics, rasterization, and light simulation, what people call ray tracing, as well as deep learning and AI, merged it into one unified framework so that we can achieve cinematic rendering in real time. What it currently takes is a server about a few hours, depending on the scene, it might take as long as a full day, take a few hours to render one frame. So it takes a server, one node of a server, several hours to render one frame. And in order to render 30 frames per second, just imagine the number of servers you need. If it takes several hours per frame, and you need to render 30 frames per second in order to be real-time, it basically takes a high-performance computer, a supercomputer, a render farm, that\\'s why they call it a render farm, it\\'s a full data center designed just for rendering. And now we\\'ve created NVIDIA RTX which makes it possible to do in real time. We demonstrated RTX on 4 Quadro GV100s. It takes 4 of our latest generation Volta Tensor Core GPUs to be able to render 30 frames per second, the Star Wars cinematic that people enjoyed. And so the amount that we saved, we basically took an entire data center, reduced it into one node. And we\\'re now doing it in real time. And so the amount of money that we can save people who create movies, people who do commercials, people who use film rendering to create the game content, almost every single game is done that way. There\\'s quite a bit of offline rendering to create the imagery and the textures and the lighting. And then, of course, architectural design and car design, the number of applications, the number of industries that are built on top of modern computer graphics is really quite large. And I\\'m certain that NVIDIA RTX is going to impact every single one of them. And so that\\'s our starting point, is to dramatically reduce the cost of film rendering, dramatically reduce the time that it takes to do it, and hopefully, more GPU servers will get -- will be purchased. And of course, better content will be created. Long-term, we\\'ve also now plotted the path towards doing it in real time. And someday, we will be able to put RTX into a GeForce gaming card and the transformation to the revolution to the gaming industry will be quite extraordinary. So we\\'re super excited about RTX.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is a question for Colette. I want to follow up, again, on the seasonality, understanding the prior comments. Normal seasonal for Q2 for gaming would be up in the double digits. Given your commentary on the crypto declined into Q2, given your commentary on just the general drivers around data center and the Volta ramps, I can\\'t bring that together with the idea of gaming being above seasonal within the guidance -- the context of your guidance envelope. So how should I reconcile those things? How are you actually thinking about seasonality for gaming into Q2 within the context of the scenarios that are currently contemplated in your guidance for next quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Stacy. Let me see if I can bridge together Jensen and then some comments here. Unfortunately, they are moving quite fast to the next question, so I wasn\\'t able to add on. But let me see if I can add on here and provide a little bit of clarity in terms of the seasonality. Remember, in Q1, we outgrew seasonality significantly. We left Q4 with very low inventory in terms of the channel. We spent Q1 working on establishing a decent amount of inventory available. We wanted to concentrate on our miners separately, and then you can see we did that in terms of Q1 by moving that to OEM and moving that to cryptocurrency-only boards. So we left Q1 at this point with healthy overall channel inventory levels as far as where we stand. So that then takes you now to Q2. But if we overshot in terms of seasonality in terms of Q1, we don\\'t have to do those channel-fill dynamics again as we get into Q2. But we do have demand out there for our gamers that we can now address very carefully with the overall inventory that we now have available. So putting together Q1 and Q2 together, yes, we are within normal seasonality, again, for our guidance. And we\\'ll see how we\\'ll finish in terms of the quarter. But you should be in that range. So yes, from a normal seasonality, at a year-to-date inclusive of Q2, yes, we\\'re on that overall seasonality. Always keep in mind, generally, our H2s are usually higher than our overall H1s, and that\\'s what you should think about our overall guidance. Gaming is still strong. We have to comment that our overall drivers that have taken us to this place over the last 3 to 5 years with phenomenal growth and our ability to grow that overall market is still here and all of those things are together. We\\'ve just had a few quarters in terms of making sure that we get the overall channel correct and put our miners separately. I hope that clarifies in terms of where we are, in terms of gaming seasonality.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your last question comes from Will Stein with SunTrust.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWilliam Stein,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The question relates to the supply chain challenges that you\\'ve talked so much about in the gaming end market. I\\'m wondering if there\\'s something particular to that end market that is making the shortages concentrated there? Or are, in fact, other end markets in particular that the data center end market also somewhat restricted from what growth they might have achieved if there weren\\'t the shortages that are out there? And maybe talk about the pace of recovery of those. That be really helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let me start off here, and I\\'ll have Jensen finish up on the last part of that question. But overall, our data center business did phenomenal. Volta is doing extremely well. And even now with 32-bit, we\\'re seeing tremendous adoption throughout. Again, remember it\\'s very different than the overall consumer business. You have significant amount of time for qualification, and that is moving extremely fast based on a lot of other industries and their ability to qualify. So no, there is not a supply challenge at all in terms of our data center. And our overall growth in data center, we\\'re extremely pleased with in terms of how the quarter came out. I\\'ll turn it over to you, Jensen, and you can answer the rest of the part of it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. The reason why miners love GeForce is because miners are everywhere in the world. One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is that it\\'s not any sovereign currency. And it\\'s, in the digital world, it\\'s distributed. And GeForce is the single largest distributed supercomputing infrastructure on the planet. Every gamer has a supercomputer in their PC. And GeForce is so broadly distributed, it\\'s available everywhere. And so GeForce is really a good candidate for any new cryptocurrency or any new cryptography algorithm that comes along. We try the best we can to go directly to the major miners, and the major miners. And they represent the vast majority of the demand. And to the best of our ability, serve their needs directly and we call that CMP, and that\\'s why it\\'s not called GeForce. They\\'re called CMP. And we can serve those miners directly, hopefully, to take some of the demand pressure off of the GeForce market. Because ultimately, what we would like is, we would like the market for GeForce pricing to come down so that the gamers could benefit from the GeForces that we built for them. And the gaming demand is strong. I mean, the bottom line is, Fortnite is a home run. The bottom line is, PUBG is a home run. And the number of gamers that are enjoying these games is really astronomic, as people know very well. And it\\'s a global phenomenon. These 2 games are equally fun in Asia as it is in Europe, as it is in the United States. And because you team up and this is a Battle Royale, you\\'d rather play with your friends. So it\\'s incredibly social. It\\'s incredibly sticky. And more and more -- more gamers that play, more of their friends join, and more of their friends join, more gamers that play. And so it\\'s this positive feedback system, and the guys at Epic did a fantastic job creating Fortnite, and it\\'s just a wonderful game genre that people are really enjoying. And so I think at the core of it, gaming is strong and we are looking forward to inventory normalizing in the channel so that pricing could normalize in the channel, so that gamers can come back to buy the GeForce cards that has now been in short supply for over a quarter. And so the pent-up demand is quite significant, and I\\'m expecting the gamers to be able to buy new GeForces pretty soon.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Unfortunately, we have ran out of time. I will now turn it back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let\\'s see here. Is it my turn again?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It is.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. We had another great quarter. Record revenue, record margins, record earnings, growth across every platform. Data center achieved another record, with strong demand for Volta and AI inference. Gaming was strong. We\\'re delighted to see prices normalizing and we can better serve pent-up gamer demand.\\\\nAt the heart of our opportunity is the incredible growth of computing demand of AI, just as traditional computing has slowed. The GPU computing approach that we\\'ve pioneered is ideal for filling this vacuum. And our invention of the Tensor Core GPU has further enhanced our strong position to power the AI era. I look forward to giving you another update next quarter. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This concludes today\\'s conference call.

Revenue reached a record in the third quarter exceeding $2 billion for the first time. Driving this was success in our Pascal-based gaming platform and growth in our data center platform reflecting the role of NVIDIA\\'s GPU as the engine of AI  computing. Q3 revenue increased 54% from a year earlier to $2 billion and was up 40% from the previous quarter. Strong year-on-year gains were achieved across all four of our platforms. Gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. The GPU business was up 53% to $1.7 billion, and the Tegra processor business increased 87% to $241 million. \\\\nLet\\'s start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue crossed the $1 billion mark and increased 63% year on year to a record $1.24 billion fueled by our Pascal-based GPUs. Demand was strong in every geographic region across desktop and notebook and across the full gaming audience from GTX 1050 to the Titan X. GeForce gaming PC notebooks recorded significant gains. Our continued growth in the GTX gaming GPUs reflects the unprecedented performance and efficiency gains in the Pascal architecture. It delivers seamless play on games and richly immersive VR experiences. \\\\nIn Q3 for desktops, we launched the GTX 1050 and the 1050 Ti bringing eSports and VR capabilities at great value. For notebooks, we introduced GTX 1080, 1070, and 1060 giving gamers a major leap forward in performance and efficiency in a mobile experience. The fundamentals of the gaming market remain strong. The production value of blockbuster games continues to increase. \\\\nGamers are upgrading to higher-end GPUs to enjoy highly anticipated fall titles like Battlefield 1, Gears of War 3, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and eSports is attracting a new generation of gamers to the PC. League of Legends is played by over 100 million gamers each month. And, there is now a Twitch audience of more than 300 million who follow eSports. VR and AR will redefine entertainment and gaming. A great experience requires a high performance GPU, and we believe we are still in the early innings of these evolving markets. Pascal represents not only the biggest innovation gains we\\'ve made in a single GPU generation in a decade, it\\'s also our best executed product rollout. \\\\nMoving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew 9% from a year ago to $207 million driven by growth in the high end of the markets for Realtime rendering and mobile workstations. We are seeing strong customer interest in the Pascal-based P6000 among digital entertainment leaders like: Pixar, Disney, and ILM, architectural, engineering, and construction companies like Japan\\'s SHIMIZU, and automotive companies like Hyundai.  \\\\nNext, data center. Revenue nearly tripled from a year ago and was up 59% sequentially to $240 million. Growth was strong across all fronts in AI and supercomputing for hyperscale as well as for GRID virtualization and supercomputing. GPU deep learning is revolutionizing AI and is poised to impact every industry worldwide. Hyperscale companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Baidu are using it to solve problems for their billions of consumers. \\\\nCloud GPU computing has shown explosive growth. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Ali cloud are deploying NVIDIA GPUs for AI data analytics and HPC.  AWS most recently announced its new EC2 P2 Instance which scales up to 16 GPUs to accelerate a wide range of AI applications including image and video recognition, unstructured data analytics, and video transcoding.  We saw strong growth in AI training.  For AI inference, we announced the Tesla P4 and P40 to serve power-efficient and high performance workloads, respectively. \\\\nShipments began in Q3 for the DGX-1 AI super computer. Early users include major universities like Stanford, UC Berkeley, and NYU, leading research groups such as OpenAI, the German Institute of Artificial Intelligence, and the Swiss Artificial Intelligence Lab as well as multinationals like  SAP. So far this year, our GPU technology conference program has reached 18,000 developers and ecosystem partners underscoring the broad enthusiasm for AI. Complementing our major spring event in Silicon Valley, we have organized GPCs in seven cities on four continents. They drew sellout audiences in Beijing, Taipei, Tokyo, and Seoul, as well as Amsterdam, Melbourne, and Washington DC, with Mumbai still to come. Along with 400 sessions and labs, we provided training in AI skills to nearly 2,000 individuals through our Deep Learning Institute construction program. \\\\nWe also have begun partnering with key global companies to enable the adoption of AI. To implement AI in manufacturing, we announced a collaborative with Japan\\'s FANUC focused on robots and automated factories, and in the transportation sector, more than 80 OEMs, Tier 1s, and startups are using our GPUs for their work on self-driving cars. \\\\nOur GRID graphics virtualization business continues to achieve extremely strong growth. Adoption is accelerating across a variety of industries particularly manufacturing, automotive, engineering, and education. Among customers added this quarter were John Hopkins University and GE global India. \\\\nAnd, finally, in automotive, revenue increased to a record $127 million, up 61% year over year and up 7% sequentially from premium infotainment products. NVIDIA is developing an end-to-end AI computing platform for autonomous driving. This allows car makers to collect and label data, train their own deep neural networks on the video GPUs in the data center, and then process them in the car with DRIVE PX 2. \\\\nWe have also been developing a cloud-to-car HD mapping system with mapping companies all over the world. Two such partnerships were announced this quarter. We are working with Baidu to create a cloud-to-car development platform with HD maps, Level 3 autonomous vehicles, and automated parking. We are also partnering with TomTom to develop an AI-based, cloud-to-car mapping system that enables real-time, in-car localization to mapping. \\\\nWe\\'ve developed an integrated, scalable AI platform with capabilities ranging from automated highway driving to fully autonomous driving operation. We are extending the DRIVE PX2 architecture to scale in performance and power consumption. It will range from DRIVE PX2 auto cruise with a single SSE for self-driving on highways up to multiple DRIVE PX2 computers capable of enabling fully autonomous driving. \\\\nWe also announced a single-chip AI supercomputer called Xavier with over 7 billion transistors. Xavier incorporates our next GPU architecture, a custom CPU design, and a new computer vision accelerator. Xavier will deliver performance equivalent to today\\'s full DRIVE PX2 board, and its two Parker SoCs and two Pascal GPUs while only consuming a fraction of the energy. \\\\nFinally, Tesla motors announced last month that all its factory-produced vehicles: the Model S, the Model X, and upcoming Model 3 feature a new autopilot system powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE PX2 platform and will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates. This system delivers over 40 times the processing power of the previous technology and runs a new, neural network for vision, sonar, and data processing. Beyond our four platforms, our OEM and IP business was $186 million, down 4% year on year. \\\\nNow, turning to the rest of the income statement.  GAAP gross margin for Q3 was a record 59%, and non-GAAP gross margin was a record 59.2%. These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success of our platform approach, and strong demand for Deep Learning. GAAP operating expenses were $544 million including $66 million in stock-based compensation and other charges. \\\\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $478 million, up 11% from one year earlier. This reflects headcount-related costs for our growth initiatives as well as investments in sales and marketing. We intend to continue to invest in Deep Learning to capture this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Thus, we would expect the operating expense growth rate to be sustained over the next several quarters. \\\\nGAAP operating income was $639 million. Non-GAAP operating income more than doubled to $708 million. Non-GAAP operating margins were over 35% this quarter. For FY18, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. We also announced a 22% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share. \\\\nNow turning to the outlook for the fourth-quarter of FY17, we expect revenue to be $2.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin are expected to be 59% and 59.2%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $572 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. And, GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the fourth quarter of FY17 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. With that, Operator, I\\'m going to turn it back to you and see if we can take some questions. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) \\\\nMark Lipacis, Jefferies.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter. I think to start out, Jen-Hsun, maybe if you could help us understand -- the data center business tripled year over year. What\\'s going on in that business that\\'s enabling that to happen?  if you could maybe talk about if it\\'s on the technology side or the end market side?  And, maybe as part of that, you can help us deconstruct the revenues and what\\'s really driving that growth?  And, I had a follow-up, too. Thanks. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nA couple things. First of all, GPU computing is more important than ever. There\\'s so many different types of applications that require GPU computing today, and it\\'s permeating all over enterprise. There are several applications that we\\'re really driving. One of them is graphics virtualization, application virtualization.  Partnering with VMware and Citrix, we have essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the data center. \\\\nThe second is computational sciences. Using our GPU for general-purpose scientific computing, and scientific computing, as you know, is not just for scientists. It\\'s running equations and using numerics is a tool that is important to a large number of industries. And then, third, one of the most exciting things that we\\'re doing because of deep learning we\\'ve really ignited a wave of AI innovation all over the world. These several applications -- graphics application, virtualization, computational science, and data science has really driven our opportunity in the data center. \\\\nThe thing that made it possible though -- the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation from our Company from a graphics processor to a general-purpose processor, and then on top of that -- probably the more important part of that is transforming from a chip Company to a platform Company. What makes application and graphics virtualization possible is a complicated stack of software we call GRID, and you have heard me talk about it for several years now.  And, second, in the area of numerics and computational sciences, CUDA, our rich library of applications and libraries on top of numerics -- numerical libraries on top of CUDA and all the tools that  we have invested in the ecosystem we have worked with all the developers all around the world that now know how to use CUDA to develop applications makes that part of our business possible.  \\\\nAnd then, third, our deep learning toolkit, the NVIDIA deep learning toolkit has made it possible for all frameworks in the world to get GPU acceleration. And, with GPU acceleration the benefit is incredible. It\\'s not 20% it\\'s not 50%. It\\'s 20 times, 50 times. That translates to most importantly for researchers the ability to gain access to insight much, much faster. Instead of months, it could be days. It\\'s essentially like having a time machine. And, secondarily, for IT managers it translates to lower energy consumption, and most importantly, it translates to a substantial reduction in data center cost. Whereas you have a rack of servers with GPUs, it replaces an entire basketball court of cluster of off-the-shelf servers.  And so, a pretty big deal. A great value proposition. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya, Bank of America Merrill Lynch \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question and congratulations on the consistent growth and execution. Jen-Hsun, one more on the data center business.  It has obviously grown very strongly this year, but in the past, it has been lumpy.  For example, when I go back to your FY15, it grew 60% to 70% year on year. Last year, it grew about 7%.  This year, it is growing over 100%. How should we think about the diversity of customers and the diversity of applications to help us forecast how the business can grow over the next one or two years? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think embedded in your question, in fact, are many of the variables that influence our business. Especially in the beginning, several years ago when we started working on GPU computing and bringing this capability into data centers.  We relied on supercomputing centers in the beginning, and then, we relied on remote workstations, data center workstations, if you will, virtualized workstations.  And, then, increasingly we started relying on -- we started seeing demand from hyperscale data centers as they used our GPUs for deep learning and to develop their networks. And now, we\\'re starting to see data centers take advantage of our new GPUs, P40 and P4 to apply to operate, to use the networks for inferencing in a large-scale way. So, I think we are moving, if you will, our data center business in multiple trajectories. \\\\nThe first trajectory is the number of applications we can run. Our GPU now has the ability with one architecture to run all of those applications that I mentioned from graphics virtualization to scientific computing to AI. Second, we used to be in data centers, but now we\\'re in data centers, supercomputing centers, as well as hyperscale data centers. And then, third, the number of applications -- industries that we effect is growing. It used to start with supercomputing.  Now, we have supercomputing.  We have automotive.  We have oil and gas.  We have energy discovery.  We have financial services industry.  We have, of course, one of the largest industries in the world, consumer Internet Cloud services.  And so, we\\'re starting to see applications in all of those different dimensions. \\\\nI think the combination of those three things: the number of applications, the number of platforms and locations by which we have success.  And then, of course, the number of industries that we affect.  The combination of that should give us more upward directory in a consistent way. But, I think really, the mega point though is really the size of the industries we are now able to engage. In no time in the history of our Company have we ever been able to engage industries of this magnitude. And so, that\\'s the exciting part, I think, in the final analysis. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat.  Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Jen-Hsun, you\\'ve been on the road quite a bit over the past few months, and I\\'m sure you\\'ve had the opportunity to connect with many of your important customers and partners. Can you maybe share with us what you learned from the multiple trips?  And, how your view on the Company\\'s long-term growth trajectory changed, if at all? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes.  Thanks a lot, Toshi. First of all, the reason why I\\'ve been on the road for almost two months solid is because at the request and the demand, if you will, from developers all over the world for a better understanding of GPU computing and getting access to our platform and learning about all of the various applications that GPUs can now accelerate. The demand is just really great. We no longer could do GTC, which is our developer conference, essentially our developer conference.  We can no longer do GTC just here in Silicon Valley, and so we this year decided to take it on the road.  And, we went to China, went to Taiwan, went to Japan, went to Korea.  We had one in Australia, and also one in India and Washington DC and Amsterdam for Europe. \\\\nSo, we pretty much covered the world with our first global developer conference. I would say probably the two themes that came out of it, is that GPU acceleration, the GPU has really reached a tipping point. That it is so available everywhere.  It\\'s available on PCs.  It\\'s available from every computer company in the world.  It\\'s in the cloud.  It\\'s in the data center.  It\\'s in laptops.  GPU is no longer a niche component. As they say, it\\'s a large-scale, massively available general-purpose computing platform. So I think people realize now the benefits of GPU and that the incredible speedup or cost reduction -- basically, the opposite sides of a coin that you can get with GPUs. So, GPU computing. \\\\nNumber two, is AI. Just the incredible enthusiasm around AI, and the reason for that, of course, for everybody who knows already about AI what I\\'m going to say is pretty clear.  But, there\\'s a large number of applications, problems, challenges where a numerical approach is not available. A laws-of-physics-based, equation-based approach is not available. These problems are very complex.  Oftentimes, the information is incomplete, and there\\'s no laws of physics around it. For example, what\\'s the laws of physics of what I look like? What\\'s the laws of physics for recommending tonight\\'s movie? So, there\\'s no laws of physics involved. \\\\nThe question is how do you solve those kind of incomplete problems? There\\'s no laws-of-physics equation that you can program into a car that causes the car to drive and drive properly. These are artificial intelligence problems. Search is an artificial intelligence problem.  Recommendations is an artificial intelligence problem.  So, now that GPU deep learning has ignited this capability, and it has made it possible for machines to learn from a large amount of data and to determine the features by itself -- to compute the features to recognize.  GPU deep learning has really ignited this wave of AI revolution. So, I would say the second thing that is just incredible enthusiasm around the world is learning how to use GPU deep learning.  How to use it to solve AI-type problems, and to do so in all of the industries that we know from healthcare to transportation to entertainment to enterprise to you name it. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik, Citigroup.   \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik,  Citigroup - Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations. You mentioned that Maxwell upgrade was about 30% of your (technical difficulty) exactly two years. Should we be thinking about a two-year time (inaudible)?   \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif, first of all, there were several places where you cut out, and this is one of those artificial intelligence problems. Because what I heard incomplete information, but I\\'m going to infer from some of the important words that I did hear, and I\\'m going to apply in this case human intelligence to see if I can predict what it is that you were trying to ask. The baseline, the basis of your question was that Maxwell -- in the past, Maxwell GPU during that generation, we saw an upgrade cycle about every two or three years. And, we had an install base of some 60 million, 80 million gamers during that time and several years have now gone by. The question is what would be the upgrade cycle for Pascal, and what would it look like? \\\\nThere are several things that have changed that I think it\\'s important to know that could affect the Pascal upgrade. First of all, the increase in adoption, the number of units has grown, and the number of the ASP has grown.  And, I think the reason for that is several-fold. I think, one, the number of gamers in the world is growing. Everybody that is effectively born in the last 10, 15 years are likely to be a gamer and so long as they have access to electricity and the Internet, they are very likely a gamer. The quality of games has grown significantly. \\\\nOne of the factors of production value of games that has been possible is because the PC and the two game consoles, Xbox and PlayStation, and in the future, in the near future, the Nintendo Switch.  All of these architectures are common in the sense that they all use modern GPUs.  They all use programmable shading, and they all have basically similar features. They have very different design points. They have different capabilities, but they have very similar architectural features. As a result of that, game developers can target a much larger install base with one common code base. As a result, they can increase the production quality, the production value of the games. \\\\nThe second -- and one of the things that you might have noticed that recently, PlayStation and Xbox both announced 4K versions.  Basically, the Pro versions of their game console. That\\'s really exciting for the gaming industry.  It\\'s really exciting for us because what\\'s going to happen is the production value of games will amp up, and as a result, it would increase the adoption of higher-end GPUs. I think that that\\'s a very important positive.  That\\'s probably the second one.  The first one being the number of gamers is growing.  Second is game production value continues to grow. \\\\nAnd then the third is gaming is no longer just about gaming. Gaming is part sports, part gaming, and part social. There\\'s a lot of people who play games just so they can hang out with their other friends who are playing games. It\\'s a social phenomenon.  And then, of course, because games are -- the quality of games, the complexity of games, and some such as League of Legends, such as StarCraft; the real-time simulation, the real-time strategy component of it, the agility, the hand-eye coordination part of it, the incredible teamwork part of it is so great that it has become a sport. Because there are so many people in gaming, because it\\'s a fun thing to do, and  it\\'s hard to do so it\\'s hard to master.  And the size of the industry is large.  It has become a real sporting event. \\\\nAnd, one of the things that I\\'ll predict is that one of these days, I believe that gaming would likely be the world\\'s largest sport industry. And, the reason for that is because it\\'s the largest industry. There are more people who play games and now enjoy games and watch other people play games than there are people who play football, for example. So, I think it stands to reason that eSports will be the largest sporting industry in the world, and that\\'s just a matter of time before it happens. So, I think all of these factors have been driving both the increase in the size of the market for us as well as the ASP of the GPUs for us. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteven Chin, UBS.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, first question if I could on your comments regarding the GRID systems. You mentioned some accelerating demands in the manufacturing and automotive verticals?  Just wondering if you had any thoughts on what inning you are currently in, in terms of seeing a strong ramp-up towards a full run rate for those areas?  And, especially for the broader corporate enterprise and market vertical, also? And, as a quick follow-up on the gaming side, was wondering if you had any thoughts on whether or not there is still a big gap between the ramp-up of Pascal supply and the pent-up demand for those new products? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. I would say that we\\'re probably in the first at-bat of the first inning of GRID. The reason for that is this. We prepared ourselves. We went to spring training camp.  We came up through the farm league or something like that.  I\\'m not really a baseball player, but I heard some people talk about it. So, I think we\\'re probably at the first at-bat of the first inning. The reason why I\\'m excited about it is because I believe in the future applications are virtualized in the data center or in the cloud. \\\\nOn first principles, I believe that data applications will be virtualized, and that you will be able to enjoy these applications irrespective of whether you\\'re using a PC, a chrome notebook, a Mac, or a Linux workstation. It simply won\\'t matter. And yet, on the other hand, I believe that in the future applications will become increasingly GPU-accelerated. How do you put something in the cloud that have no GPUs, and how do you GPU-accelerate these applications that are increasingly GPU-accelerated? The answer is, of course, is putting GPUs in the cloud and putting GPUs in data center.  That\\'s what GRID is all about. It\\'s about virtualization.  It\\'s about putting GPUs in large-scale data centers and be able to virtualize the applications so that we can enjoy it on any computer, on any device, and putting computing closer to the data. \\\\nI think we\\'re just in the beginning of that, and that could explain why GRID is finally after a long period of time of building the ecosystem, building the infrastructure, developing all the software, getting the quality of service to be really exquisite, working with the ecosystem partners, it has really taken off. And I could surely expect to see it continue to grow at the rate that we\\'re seeing for some time. \\\\nIn terms of Pascal, we are still ramping. Production is fully ramped in the sense that all of our products are fully qualified. They are on the market. They have been certified and qualified with OEMs. However, demand is still fairly high so we\\'re going to continue to work hard. Our manufacturing partner, TSMC, is doing a great job for us.  The yields are fantastic for 2016 FinFET, and they\\'re just doing a fantastic job supporting us.  We\\'re just going to keep running at it. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley.   \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much.  Great quarter by the way and still amazed how good this is. Can you talk a little bit about the size of the inference opportunity?  Obviously, you have done really well in training.  I assume penetrating inference is reasonably early on, but can you talk about how you see GPUs competitively versus FPGAs on that side of it, and how big you think that opportunity could become? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, I\\'ll start backwards. I\\'ll start backwards and answer the FPGA question first. FPGA is good at a lot of things, and anything that you could do on an FPGA if the market opportunity is large, you could always -- it\\'s always better to develop an ASIC.   And, FPGA is what you use when the volume is not large. FPGA is what you use when you are not certain about the functionality you want to put into something. FPGA is largely useful when the volume is not large. Because you could build an ASIC -- you could build a full-custom chip that obviously could deliver more performance.  Not 20% more performance but 10 times better performance and better energy efficiency than you could using FPGAs. I think that\\'s a well-known fact. \\\\nOur strategy is very different than any of that. Our strategy is really about building a computing platform. Our GPU is not a specific function thing anymore. It\\'s a general-purpose parallel processor. CUDA can do molecular dynamics.  It could do fluid dynamics.  It could do partial differential equations.  It could do linear algebra.  It could do artificial intelligence.  It could be used for seismic analysis.  It could be used for computer graphics, even computer graphics.  And so, our GPU is incredibly flexible, and it\\'s really designed for, it\\'s designed specifically for parallel throughput computing. And, by combining it with the CPU, we have created a computing platform that is both good at sequential information, sequential instruction processing as well as very high throughput data processing. And so, we have created a computing architecture that\\'s good at both of those things. \\\\nThe reason why we believe that\\'s important is because several things. We want to build a computing platform that is useful to a large industry. You could use it for AI.  You could use it for search.  You could use it for video transcoding.  You could use it for energy discovery.  You could use it for health.  You could use it for finance.  You could use it for robotics.  You could use it for all these different things. \\\\nOn the first principles, we\\'re trying to build a computing platform. It\\'s a computing architecture. And, not a dedicated application thingy. Most of the customers that we\\'re calling on, most of the markets that we are addressing, and the areas that we have highlighted are all computer users. They need to use and deploy a computing platform. It has the benefit of being able to rapidly improve their AI networks. \\\\nAI is still in the early days. It\\'s the early days of early days, and GPU deep learning is going through innovations at a very fast clip. Our GPU allows people to learn to develop new networks and deploy new networks as quickly as possible. So, I think the way to think about it is think of our GPU as a computing platform. \\\\nIn terms of the market opportunity, the way I would look at it is this. The way I would look at is there are something along the lines of 5 million to 10 million hyperscale data center nodes. I think, as you have heard me say this before, I think that training is a new set of HPC clusters that have been added into these data centers.  And then, the next thing that\\'s going to happen is you\\'re going to see GPUs being added to a lot of these 5 million to 10 million nodes so that you could accelerate every single query that will likely come into the data center will be an AI query in the future. I think GPUs have an opportunity to see a fairly large hyperscale installed base. \\\\nBut, beyond that there is the enterprise market. Still although, a lot of computing is done in the cloud, a great deal of computing especially the type of computing that we\\'re talking about here that requires a lot of data -- and we\\'re a data throughput machine -- the type of computers that we\\'re talking about tends to be one of being in enterprise.  And, I believe a lot of the enterprise market is going to go towards AI; and the type of things that we are looking for in the future is to simplify our business processors using AI, to find business intelligence or insight using AI, to optimize our supply chain using AI, to optimize our forecasting using AI, to optimize the way that we find and surprise and delight customers, digital customers or customers in digital using AI. So, all of these parts of the business operations of large companies, I think AI can really enhance. \\\\nAnd then, the third -- so hyperscale, enterprise computing, and then the third is something very, very new.  It\\'s called IoT. IoT -- we\\'re going to have 1 trillion things connected to the Internet over time, and they are going to be measuring things from vibration, to sound, to images, to temperature, to air pressure, to -- you name it. These things are going to be all over the world, and we are going to measure and we are going to be constantly measuring and monitoring their activity. And, using the only thing that we can imagine that can help to add value to that and find insight from that is really AI using deep learning. We could have these new types of computers, and they will likely be on-premise or near the location of the cluster of things that you have. And, monitor all of these devices and keep -- prevent them from failing or adding intelligence to it so that they add more value to what it is that people have them do. So, I think the size of the marketplace that we are addressing is really larger than any time in our history.  And, probably the easiest way to think about it is we\\'re now a computing platform Company. We are simply a computing platform Company, and our focus is GPU computing and one of the major applications is AI. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Ellis, B. Riley and Company.   \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Ellis,  B. Riley & Co. - Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking the question and congratulations on the stellar execution. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to go back to the automotive business.  In the past, the Company has mentioned that the revenues consist of display and then on the auto-pilot side both consulting and product revenues.  But, I think much more intensively on the consulting side for now. But, as we look ahead to Xavier and the announcement that you had made intra-quarter that, that\\'s coming late next year, how should we expect that the revenue mix would evolve?  Not just from consulting to product, but from Parker towards Xavier? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI don\\'t know that I have really granular breakdowns for you, Craig, partly because I\\'m just not sure.  But, I think the dynamics are that self-driving cars is probably the single-most disruptive event -- the most disruptive dynamic that\\'s happening in the automotive industry. It\\'s almost impossible for me to imagine that in five years time, a reasonably capable car will not have autonomous capability at some level. And, a very significant level at that. I think what Tesla has done by launching and having on the road in the very near future here full autonomous driving capability using AI, that has sent a shockwave through the automotive industry. It\\'s basically five years ahead. \\\\nAnybody who\\'s talking about 2021, that\\'s just a non-starter anymore. I think that, that\\'s probably the most significant bit in the automotive industry. Anybody who was talking about autonomous capabilities and 2020 and 2021 is at the moment reevaluating in a very significant way. So, I think that, of course, will change how our business profile will ultimately look. It depends on those factors. Our autonomous vehicle strategy is relatively clear, but let me explain it anyway. \\\\nNumber one, we believe that autonomous vehicles is not a detection problem, it\\'s an AI computing problem. That it\\'s not just about detecting objects. It\\'s about perception of the environment around you.  It\\'s about reasoning about what to do -- what is happening and what to do -- and to take action based on that reasoning. And, to be continuously learning. So, I think that AI computing requires a fair amount of computation, and anybody who thought that it would take only one or two watt -- basically, the amount of energy -- one-third the energy of a cell phone.  I think it\\'s unfortunate, and it is not going to happen any time soon. \\\\nSo, I think people now recognize that AI computing is a very software-rich problem, and it is a supremely exciting AI problem. And, that deep learning and GPUs could add a lot of value, and it is going to happen in 2017, it\\'s not going to happen in 2021. I think number one.  Number two, our strategy is to apply, to deploy a one-architecture platform that is open that car companies could work on to leverage our software stack and create their network, their artificial intelligence network. And, that we would address everything from highway cruising, excellent highway cruising, all the way to full autonomous to trucks to shuttles. And, using one computing architecture, we could apply it for radar-based systems, radar plus cameras, radar plus cameras plus Lidars.  We could use it for all kinds of sensor fusion environments. So, I think our strategy is really resonating well with the industry as people now realize that we need the computation capability five years earlier. That\\'s not a detection problem, but it\\'s an AI computing problem and that software is really intensive. But, these three observations, I think, has put us in a really good position. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitch Steves, RBC Capital Markets.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitch Steves,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi.  Thanks for taking my question.  Great quarter across the board.  I did want to return to the automotive segment because the data center segment has been talked about at length.  With the new Drive PX platform increasing potentially the ASPs, how do we think about the ASPs for automotive going forward?  And, if I recall, you had about $30 million in backlog in terms of cars?  I\\'m not sure if it\\'s possible to get an update there as well? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur architecture for Drive PX is scalable. You could start from one Parker SoC, and that allows you to have surround camera.  It allows you to use AI for highway cruising. And, if you would like to have even more cameras so that your functionality could be used more frequently in more conditions, you could always add more processors. So, we go from one to four processors.  And, if it\\'s a fully autonomous, driverless car -- a driverless taxi, for example, you might need more than even four of our processors. You might need eight processors. You might need 12 processors. And, the reason for that is because you need to reduce the circumstance by which auto-pilot doesn\\'t work, doesn\\'t turn on, excuse me, doesn\\'t engage. And, because you don\\'t have a driver in the car at all. I think that depending on the application that you have, we will have a different configuration, and it\\'s scalable. It ranges from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars so I think it just depends on what configuration people are trying to deploy. Now for a few thousand dollars, the productivity of that vehicle is incredible as you can simply do the math. It\\'s much more available. The cost of operations is reduced. And, a few thousand dollars is surely almost nothing in the context of that use case. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur, JPMorgan.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGood afternoon.  Congratulations on the solid execution and growth. Looking at some of your cloud customers\\' new services offerings, you mentioned AWS EC2 P2 platform.  You have Microsoft Azure\\'s Cloud Services platforms.  It\\'s interesting because they are ramping new instances primarily using your K80 accelerator platform which means that the Maxwell base and the recently introduced Pascal-based adoption curves are still way ahead of the team which obviously is a great setup as it relates to the continued strong growth going forward.  Can you just help us understand why the long design and cycle times for these accelerators?  And, when do you expect the adoption curve for the Maxwell-based accelerators to start to kick in with some of your Cloud customers? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan, good question.  And, it\\'s exactly the reason why having started almost five years ago in working with all of these large-scale data centers is what it takes. The reason for that is because several things have to happen. Applications have to be developed. They\\'re hyperscale.  They are enterprise -- their data center-level software has to accommodate this new computing platform. The neural networks have to be developed and trained and ready for deployment. The GPUs have to be tested against every single data center and every single server configuration that they have, and it takes that type of time to deploy at the scales that we are talking about. So, I think that, that\\'s number one. \\\\nThe good news is that between Kepler and Maxwell and Pascal, the architecture is identical. Even though the underlying architecture has been improved dramatically and the performance increases dramatically, the software layer is the same. So, the adoption rate of our future generations is going to be much, much faster, and you will see that. It takes that long to integrate our software and our architecture and our GPUs into all of the data centers around the world. It takes a lot of work. It takes a long time. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRomit Shah, Nomura.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRomit Shah,  Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. - Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thank you.  Jen-Hsun, I just wanted to ask regarding the auto-pilot win.  We know that you displaced Mobileye,  and I was just curious if you could talk about why Tesla chose your GPU?  And, what you can give us in terms of the ramp and timing, and how would a ramp like this affect automotive gross margin? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think there are three things that we offer today. The first thing is that it\\'s not a detection problem, it\\'s an AI computing problem. And, a computer has processors and the architecture is coherent and you can program it.  You could write software.  You can compile to it.  It\\'s an AI computing problem, and our GPU computing architecture has the benefit of 10 years of refinement. In fact, this year is the 10-year anniversary of our first GPGPU, our first CUDA GPU called G8, and we been working on this for 10 years.  And so, the number one is autonomous driving, autonomous vehicles is an AI computing problem.  It\\'s not a detection problem. \\\\nSecond, car companies realize that they need to deliver ultimately a service. That the service is a network of cars by which they continuously improve. It\\'s like phones. It\\'s like set-top boxes. You have to maintain and serve that customer because they are interested in the service of autonomous driving. It\\'s not a functionality. Autonomous driving is always being improved with better maps and better driving behavior and better perception capability and better AI, so the software component of it and the ability for car companies to own their own software once they develop it on our platform is a real positive. Real positive to the point where it\\'s enabling, or it\\'s essential for the future of the driving fleets. \\\\nAnd then, the third -- to be able to continue to do OTA on them.  And, third, is simply the performance and energy level. I don\\'t believe it\\'s actually possible at this moment in time to deliver an AI computing platform of the performance level that is required to do autonomous driving at an energy efficiency level that is possible in a car and to put all the functionality together in a reasonable way. I believe DRIVE PX2 is the only viable solution on the planet today. So, because Tesla had a great intention to deliver this level of capability to the world five years ahead of anybody else, we were a great partner for them. So, those are probably the three reasons.  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity.   \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much. Good afternoon. Jen-Hsun, I make an interesting observation about your commentary that your Company has gone from a graphic accelerator Company to a computing platform Company, and I think that\\'s fantastic. One of the things that I wonder as maybe AI and deep learning acceleration standardize on your platform, what you are seeing and hearing in the Valley about startup activity?  And, folks that are trying to innovate around the platform that you are bringing up both complementary to what you are doing, and potentially really long-term competitive to what you are doing?  Would love to hear your perspectives on that. Thanks. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, Matthew, I really appreciate that. We see a large number of AI startups around the world. There\\'s a very large number here in the United States, of course. There\\'s quite a significant number in China. There\\'s a very large number in Europe. There\\'s a large number in Canada. It\\'s pretty much a global event. The number of software companies that have now jumped on to using GPU deep learning and taking advantage of the computing platform that we have taken almost seven years to build, and it\\'s really quite amazing. We are tracking about 1,500. \\\\nWe have a program called Inception, and Inception is our startup support program, if you will. They can get access to our early technology.  They can get access to our expertise, our computing platform, and all that we\\'ve learned about deep learning we can share with many of these startups. They are trying to use deep learning in industries from cybersecurity to genomics to consumer applications, computational finance, to IoT, robotics, and self-driving cars. The number of startups out there is really quite amazing. \\\\nSo, our deep learning platform is a really unique advantage for them because it\\'s available in a PC so you can -- almost anybody with even a couple hundred dollars of spending money can get a startup going with a [video] GPU that can do deep learning. It\\'s available from system builders and server OEMs all over the world: HP, Dell, Cisco, IBM, system builders, small system builders, local system builders all over the world. And very importantly, it\\'s available in cloud data centers all over the world so Amazon AWS, Microsoft\\'s Azure cloud has a really fantastic implementation ready to scale out.  You have got the IBM cloud.  You have got Alibaba cloud.  So, if you have a few dollars an hour for computing, you pretty much can get a company started and use the NVIDIA platform in all of these different places. So, it\\'s an incredibly productive platform because of its performance.  It works with every framework in the world.  It\\'s available basically everywhere, and so as a result of that, we\\'ve given artificial intelligence startups anywhere on the planet the ability to jump on and create something. The availability, if you will, the democratization of deep learning -- NVIDIA\\'s GPU deep learning is really quite enabling for startups. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong, Wells Fargo. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks very much. It was really impressive that 60% growth in your gaming revenues.  So, does this imply that there was a 60% jump in [cards] that are being  been sold by [online] retailers and retail stores?  Or, does the growth reflect new channels through which NVIDIA gaming products are getting to customers? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIt\\'s largely the same channels. Our channel has been pretty stable for some time. We have a large network.  I appreciate your question. It\\'s one of our great strengths, if you will. We cultivated over two decades a network of partners who take the GeForce platform out to the world. You could access our GPUs. You can access GeForce and be part of the GeForce PC gaming platform from literally anywhere on the planet. So, that\\'s a real advantage, and we\\'re really proud of them. \\\\nI guess you could also say that Nintendo contributed a fair amount to that growth, and over the next -- as you know, the Nintendo architecture and the Company tends to stick with an architecture for a very long time so we\\'ve worked with them now for almost two years.  Several hundred engineering years have gone into the development of this incredible game console.  I really believe when everybody sees it and enjoy it, they are going to be amazed by it. It\\'s like nothing they\\'ve ever played with before, and of course, the brand -- their franchise and their game content is incredible. I think this is a relationship that will likely last two decades, and I\\'m super-excited about it. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWe have no more time for questions. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President and CEO    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much for joining us today. I would leave you with several thoughts that, first, we\\'re seeing growth across all of our platforms from gaming to Pro graphics, to cars to data centers. The transformation of our Company from a chip Company to a computing platform Company is really gaining traction, and you can see that you can see the results of our work as a result of things like GameWorks and GFE and Driveworks.  All of the AI that goes on top of that.  Our graphics virtualization remoting platform called GRID to the NVIDIA GPU deep learning toolkit are just really examples of how we have transformed a Company from a chip to a computing platform Company. \\\\nIn no time in the history of our Company have we enjoyed and addressed as exciting large market as we have today.  Whether it\\'s artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, the gaming market as it continues to grow and evolve, and virtual reality. And, of course, we all know now very well that GPU deep learning has ignited a wave of AI innovation all over the world, and our strategy and the thing that we\\'ve been working on for the last seven years is building an end-to-end AI computing platform. An end-to-end AI computing platform.  Starting from GPUs that we have optimized and evolved and enhanced for deep learning to system architectures to algorithms for deep learning, to tools necessary for developers to frameworks, and the work that we do with all of the framework developers and AI researchers around the world, to servers to the cloud to data centers to ecosystems and working with ISVs and startups and all the way to evangelizing and teaching people how to use deep learning to revolutionize the software that they build.  And, we call that the Deep Learning Institute, the NVIDIA DLI. These are some of the high-level points that I hope that you got, and I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis concludes today\\'s conference call.

In 2016, we made meaningful progress across the Company, strengthening our product offerings, regaining share in key markets, and creating a solid foundation for sustainable growth.\\\\nFourth-quarter revenue of $1.11 billion grew 15% from the year-ago period based on a substantial increase in computing and graphics segment revenue. Revenue decreased 15% sequentially based on seasonally lower semi-custom SoC shipments, while we achieved our second straight quarter of computing and graphics segment revenue growth. For the full year, growth across both of our business segments resulted in a 7% increase in annual revenue, non-GAAP gross margin expansion, and positive free cash flow.\\\\nLooking at our computing and graphics segment, on a full-year basis, CG annual revenue grew for the first time since 2011 as our focus on strengthening this key part of our business gained momentum. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 28% from the year-ago period based on strong GPU and mobile APU sales growth. Our CG quarterly revenue was the highest in 2 years, our client revenue was the highest in seven quarters, and we delivered our highest graphics processor revenue in 11 quarters.\\\\nMobile APU shipments and revenue growth accelerated, as strong adoption of our seventh generation notebook APUs drove notebook share gains in the quarter. Desktop processor sales increased sequentially and declined from a year ago in advance of our Ryzen desktop processor launch this quarter.\\\\nAt CES, we highlighted broad design win and ecosystem momentum for Ryzen. 17 different system integrators unveiled Ryzen-based gaming and enthusiast systems. And multiple ecosystem partners announced plans to offer a broad range of premium Ryzen motherboards.\\\\nWe have also secured a number of high-end design wins for Ryzen with our global OEMs. We remain on track to launch Ryzen in early March, with widespread system and channel availability expected on day one.\\\\nIn graphics, strong sales increases across all of our product lines drove a double-digit increase in GPU processor revenue from a year ago. Desktop GPU shipments and revenue increased by double-digit percentages from a year ago based on growing OEM and channel adoption of Polaris GPU\\'s. Polaris processor sales were particularly strong in the performance and enthusiast portions of the market, resulting in our highest channel GPU sales in more than two years.\\\\nMobile GPU sales growth outpaced desktop in the quarter, and we believe we gained further share in this part of the market as the first Polaris-based notebooks launched. We also launched Radeon Pro 400 mobile GPUs in the quarter. These ultrathin performance GPUs are ideal for mobile content creators and are powering Apple\\'s latest premium MacBook Pro notebooks.\\\\nAnd in professional graphics, we finished off a record year with record quarterly revenue and unit shipments. Traditional workstation GPU sales grew in the quarter, as HP, Dell, and others began offering systems powered by our recently launched Radeon Pro WX GPUs.\\\\nWe also continued to make progress in the server GPU market, with sales increasing significantly to support new mega data center deployments. As a part of our strategy to drive Radeon GPUs into the data center, we announced our Radeon Instinct family of machine intelligence accelerators and detailed our plans to expand the market for machine learning based on AMD\\'s unique combination of high-performance GPUs, CPUs, and open source software.\\\\nTurning to our enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment, revenue increased 4% from a year ago, driven by growing embedded processor sales and ongoing demand for AMD-powered Microsoft and Sony game consoles. As we expected, revenue declined sequentially following the annual sales peak in the third quarter. 2016 game console sales aligned with our expectations, resulting in new records for semi-custom annual unit shipments and sales.\\\\nEmbedded processor sales grew by double-digit percentages sequentially and from the year-ago period based on adoption across our targeted vertical markets. And development of our next-generation server CPU, \\\\\"\\\\\"Naples\\\\\"\\\\\", is on track as we continue to expand the breadth of our customer and partner engagements to enable broad platform, ecosystem, and software validation work in advance of launch.\\\\n\\\\\"\\\\\"Naples\\\\\"\\\\\" is meeting our performance targets, and customer response to our competitiveness and differentiated feature set continues to be overwhelmingly positive. As a result, we expanded our design win momentum in both traditional and cloud servers as well as in the embedded infrastructure and communications markets.\\\\nAs we look back on 2016, we successfully accomplished our key priorities, including growing discrete graphic share led by Polaris GPU adoption; regaining client compute share led by our seventh generation APUs; growing in adjacent markets with record annual semi-custom game console revenue and professional graphics; and strengthening the financial foundation of the Company by achieving annual non-GAAP operating profitability, reducing debt, and increasing cash.\\\\nAll of our work the past two years has been designed to strengthen the technical, operational, and financial foundation of the Company. We enter 2017 with strong revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities as we prepare to launch our \\\\\"Zen\\\\\"-based CPUs and Vega GPUs that can return AMD to the high-performance markets where we have not materially participated in recent years.\\\\nThe production ramp, customer adoption, and ecosystem support for our Zen-based desktop processor Ryzen are all mapping to our plans. We also remain on track to expand \\\\\"Zen\\\\\" into the data center market in the second quarter, followed by the embedded and notebook markets in the second half of the year.\\\\nOur Vega GPU development is also progressing to plan. Vega is designed to scale beyond the limitations of current GPUs to enable PC gaming, professional design, and machine intelligence experiences that traditional GPU architectures have not been able to effectively address.\\\\nWe provided our first performance preview of Vega GPUs earlier in the quarter in advance of the launch planned for the second quarter of this year. Bringing all this together, based on our current market expectations and the strength of our upcoming products, we are confident we can grow annual revenue, expand gross margin, and deliver non-GAAP net income in 2017.\\\\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth-quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO, and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2016 was a good year for AMD as we grew revenue, improved our financial performance, and strengthened the financial foundation of the Company.\\\\nAMD annual revenue grew 7% year-over-year with growth in both business segments. We expanded gross margin, maintained essentially flat operating expenses, achieved operating profitability, and reduced net losses significantly.\\\\nIn addition, we improved our balance sheet with strategic capital market transactions that reduced and re-profiled debt, and lowered interest expense. Finally, we generated positive free cash flow and ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1.26 billion.\\\\nNow let me provide the specifics of the fourth quarter of 2016 together with quarterly year-over-year comparisons. Revenue was $1.1 billion, increasing 15% year over year due primarily to higher GPU processor sales, and declining 15% sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs, partially offset by higher sales in the computing and graphics segment. Gross margin was 32%, up 2 percentage points year over year and up 1 percentage point from the prior quarter due to higher computing and graphics segment revenue.\\\\nOperating expenses were $357 million compared to $323 million a year ago and $353 million in the prior quarter. Both increases were due to ongoing targeted investments in R&D to support our new products. Net licensing gain associated with our server JV with THATIC was $31 million, up from $24 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nOperating income was $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to an operating loss of $39 million a year ago and operating income of $70 million in the prior quarter. Operating income is down from the prior quarter due to lower revenue.\\\\nFourth-quarter net interest expense, taxes, and other was $34 million, down from $40 million a year ago and $43 million in Q3 2016, primarily due to reduced interest expense. Net loss was $8 million or loss per share of $0.01, calculated using 931 million shares of common stock. This compares to a net loss of $79 million or $0.10 a year ago and net income of $27 million or $0.03 in the prior quarter.\\\\nAdjusted EBITDA was $60 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of minus $5 million a year ago and adjusted EBITDA of $103 million in the third quarter of 2016.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments. Computing and graphics revenue was $600 million, up 28% year over year and up 27% sequentially, primarily due to higher GPU and client processor sales. Computing and Graphics business segment operating loss was $21 million, improving significantly from a loss of $99 million from a year ago and a loss of $66 million in the prior quarter, primarily through higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.\\\\nEnterprise embedded and semi-custom revenue was $506 million, up 4% year over year and down 39% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $47 million, down from $59 million a year ago and down from $136 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher R&D investments in Q4 2016, partially offset by an IP monetization licensing gain.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents total $1.26 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $785 million a year ago and $1.26 billion in the prior quarter. Inventory was $751 million compared to $678 million a year ago and $772 million in the prior quarter. Inventory levels were higher from one year ago in support of product transitions and higher revenue in the first half of 2017. Total wafer purchases from global foundries in 2016 were $665 million and $239 million in the fourth quarter.\\\\nLong-term debt on the balance sheet as of the end of the quarter was $1.44 billion, down from $1.63 billion in the prior quarter, primarily due to debt redemptions. The principal debt amount of $1.77 billion, down from $1.93 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2016, is reflected on the balance sheet as the carrying value of debt after netting the unamortized discount of our convertible debt and issuance costs.\\\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we redeemed $268 million principal amount of debt. In addition, we issued $105 million principal amount of 2 1/8% convertible notes due 2026. As a result of the underwriters exercising the option to purchase an additional 15% of the original issuance, bringing the total principal balance of the convertible notes to $805 million. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $167 million, a significant improvement from $27 million one year ago and $20 million in the third quarter of 2016.\\\\nTurning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter, we expect revenue to decrease 11% sequentially plus or minus 3%. The midpoint of guidance would result in Q1 2017 revenue increasing approximately 18% year-over year; [non-GAAP] gross margin(added by company after the call) to be approximately 33%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $360 million; [non-GAAP] interest expense, (added by company after the call) taxes, and other to be approximately $30 million; inventory to be approximately flat sequentially. We look forward to sharing additional 2017 and long-term guidance parameters at our financial analyst day in May.\\\\nIn closing, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2016. As we begin 2017, we look forward to introducing several new leadership products and remain focused on further improving our financial and operational performance.\\\\nWith that, I will turn it back to Laura. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate Vice President, IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, with that, we are ready for our first question.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Mark Lipacis, Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I\\'m hoping that you can help me understand the dynamic of desktop microprocessors ramping down in front of the Ryzen ramp. My understanding was that Ryzen was the higher-end SKU that comped against the Core i5 or Core i7, which is above where the existing microprocessors competed in the stack.\\\\nSo I\\'m wondering if we should think about Ryzen either cannibalizing the existing desktop microprocessors at a higher ASP or are you kind of ramping down the lower end? Or should we think about Ryzen layering on top of the existing lower-end desktop microprocessors? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Mark. Thanks for the question. So look, you are absolutely right. Ryzen is really a high-end desktop product. And I think the comment was really around our overall channel inventories in desktop, so we wanted to ensure a very smooth transition.\\\\nNo question that Ryzen will layer on top, competing well in the Core i7, Core i5 range. But we also will eventually see a full lineup of Ryzen throughout the desktop portfolio.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, that\\'s helpful. Thank you. And a follow-up, if I may. Is it fair to assume that as Ryzen ramps into the enthusiast stack that you would expect to see attach rates of AMD graphics cards also -- I guess I would expect to see higher attach rate of AMD GPUs with the Ryzen. Is that fair?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, if you look at our product lineup in the first half of the year, I think we have Ryzen launching in early March, and then we will have Vega, our enthusiast GPU, launching in the second quarter. And so as we go through the year, I think we are quite pleased with the performance that we are seeing on both of those products.\\\\nAnd so we should see Ryzen doing very well in the high end as well as Vega. And by nature, since both of those high-end markets are markets that we don\\'t have significant presence today, there will be an opportunity to both gain share as well as increase attach rates in those markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right. Very helpful, thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Matt Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, since we understand that Ryzen launching here in March is going to lead into relatively the same core that these -- the server microprocessor that launches in the second quarter, maybe you can give us a little bit of update on timing to the specifics that you can on the server launch. And specific, what segments of that market, maybe in terms of, I don\\'t know, application segments or percentage of the server TAM, that you might be going after in the first several quarters after you launch the server product. Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, absolutely, Matt. So as you stated, Ryzen and \\\\\"Naples\\\\\" share the same core, the same CPU core, which is our Zen core. Our performance on that core has done very well. We\\'ve actually met or exceeded our expectations.\\\\nSo Ryzen will launch in early March. \\\\\"Naples\\\\\" will launch in the second quarter. We have made very good progress, actually, in the last few months with customers really testing the performance capability on their own software and their own application workload, so we feel good about where the product is positioned.\\\\nWe expect that the key workload - \\\\\"\\\\\"Naples\\\\\"\\\\\" is really has broad applicability in the server market, but we are especially targeting workloads that will benefit from more threads, higher memory, as well as I/O bound applications. So we expect cloud, Big Data applications, as well as traditional enterprise. And our focus is both with OEMs as well as ODMs to ensure that we have a strong ecosystem ready for that launch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great, thank you. And then a couple follow-ups for Devinder, if I could. I noticed that quite a big ramp year over year in growth in the computing and graphics segment, but it\\'s still a slight operating loss on the P&L.\\\\nMaybe you could talk through maybe as the new product launches and the GPU and CPU segments of the year, how do you think about gross margin in that computing and graphics segments and getting that back to profitability. And then quickly, I think you guys guided to $50 million in THATIC IP revenue. Any help about how that is distributed through the year would be really helpful. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO, and Treasurer    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, let me cover the second one first on the THATIC IP licensing gain. You know, we had $88 million of that in 2016. As you observed, we guided $50 million in 2017. It is really dependent upon milestone deliveries, but I can share with you that based on tracking to those milestones, where we expect to recognize approximately half of that, call it $25 million, in Q1 of 2017.\\\\nAnd then as far as the second question, on the segment, Computing and Graphics: yes, very good progress I think year over year and quarter over quarter. We are very pleased with that. The segment loss has gone down significantly from Q4 2015, where we were about $100 million, so about $20 million.\\\\nAnd with the new products that are coming up, in particular, the Ryzen product we just talked about, with better gross margins and other products in the graphics space, we expect to continue to make progress in that segment, and reduce the losses and get back to profitability.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Matt, and if I can just add to that. I think the key for the computing and graphics segment is our participation at the higher end of the market for both CPUs and GPUs. And as we do that, the margin expansion as well as the revenue growth opportunity are critical to get that business to profitability.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right, thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Vivek Arya, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking my question. Good job on the execution. My first question, Lisa, is on the gaming cycle. Because it seems like we have had a number of good years. So what is your sense of where we are in that cycle?\\\\nAnd just near term, what is your perspective on GPU channel inventory? And how you are making sure the channel is not overstocked as you go into your next-generation product cycle?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely Vivek. So on the console market, I think you are right. I think the last few years have been very good from a console cycle standpoint. We finished 2016 with both units and revenue up.\\\\nAs we going to 2017, this is going to be the fifth year of the cycle. So normally, if you look at historicals, it would say that hardware sales might be down. This cycle is a bit different with both the PlayStation 4 Pro that launched a couple quarters ago and then the Scorpio -- Microsoft Scorpio that will launch later this year.\\\\nSo we will need to see how they do through the year. But I think from our standpoint, the console business has been a strong business performer for us and we are pleased with that.\\\\nRelative to the GPU market, we were very pleased with the performance in Q4 and actually throughout 2016. We got both nice desktop channel as well as notebook acceleration as we went through the year.\\\\nIn terms of channel inventory levels, actually they looked quite normal. I would say we drained a little bit of inventory in Q4. We would expect a seasonal slowdown as we go into Q1 ahead of our product launches, but nothing unusual in the channel inventory on the GPU side.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Very helpful. And as my follow-up, if you compare AMD versus your top two competitors, Intel and Nvidia, what are the biggest gaps? Because it seems like you are making good progress on the hardware side with a number of new product launches. What about software? How soon do you think you can close the gap there? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So in terms of our strategy, I think on both the CPU and the GPU side, we have been on a fairly deliberate path to ensure that we got to a very competitive roadmap. So on the CPU side with Ryzen and \\\\\"Naples\\\\\", we believe we will be quite competitive. On the GPU side, as we launch Vega, we will have a full stack top to bottom with new hardware.\\\\nWe continue to invest in software, and our approach to software is really around open source and using the ecosystem and using the community and focused on the new APIs. So in gaming, we are very focused on DX12 and Vulcan.\\\\nAnd on the professional graphics and on the GPU server side, really using our GPUOpen. So we will continue to invest in software; no question that that is really critical for the graphics market. But we feel we are making good progress.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking my questions. First on the gross margins, I was a little surprised, given the fairly powerful mix shift between computing and EESC that you had, that they weren\\'t higher. In fact, they came in about 20 basis points below guidance. Could you elaborate on the drivers in the quarter and the drivers going forward into next quarter which we will -- what we should expect.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO, and Treasurer    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think Stacy -- good question. It is basically the product mix of it in the quarter. Q4 -- if you look at Q4 in particular, we were at 31% gross margin. Q2 and Q3 and Q4, it stepped up to 32%. In Q1, we are guiding at 33%, but really it\\'s a function of the product mix.\\\\nAnd you can recall that if you are talking about Q4, this is ahead of launching the products we just talked about in terms of Ryzen, which we expect to be shipping in the early March time frame.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it, thanks. For my follow-up, I know you talked about EESC being seasonally down and we are expecting it to be down, but how did it stack up actually versus your expectations overall? Why was there such a big deceleration year over year versus Q3, where you went from kind of up 31% year over year to up 4%?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, actually, Stacy, it was very much in line with our expectations. If you look at our Q3, our Q3 was actually very strong, and that was the quarter where there were significant builds ahead of the holiday launches.\\\\nSo when you look at the console cycle in general, they tend to build really for holiday. And so July, August, September, October are big build months, November is like half a month, and then it decelerates in December. So it was not unexpected and actually performed in line with our expectations.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So why was the build so strong in Q3 than relative? Was that - year-over-year. Was that just like the PlayStation Pro or was there something else going on in Q3 that took it up so much year over year versus Q4?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, it was new product. And if you looked, in addition to the PS4 Pro, they also -- both console manufactures had new systems that they launched in that time frame as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Thank you, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, one for you or Devinder. For the first quarter, and then perhaps more importantly for the full year, can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics between your two segments?\\\\nYou guide down 11% for the first quarter, which is above or below that number. And then how does mix change throughout the year, as you have a bunch of new products launching on one side of the equation, but perhaps not as many on the EESC side.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, Ross. So for Q1, I think if you look at the -- overall, the guidance sequentially down 11%, you would expect that the semi-custom business should be down more than that. And you have seen that in our numbers the past couple of years, so it is behaving as it normally would.\\\\nSequentially, you would expect that the Computing and Graphics segment would be better than seasonal, given that we will have one month of Ryzen in the market. On a year-over-year basis, I would say the computing graphics business is where you are seeing the majority of the growth as we go into Q1 with both GPU as well as Ryzen driving that growth.\\\\nAs we go forward in the year, I think the expectations are that the product launches tend to be faster in the CG segment. In other words, from launch to revenue ramp is faster because it\\'s more consumer-based. So as we launch Ryzen in first quarter and Vega in second quarter, but then the notebook and embedded in the second half, you would expect to see that reflected.\\\\nOn the EESC side of the business, we do have our Microsoft Scorpio design win that will ramp in the year. That\\'s an important one from the semi-custom side. And we will see \\\\\"Naples\\\\\" ramp as well, albeit server will tend to be a little bit slower from design win to revenue ramp. We would expect some contribution in the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great, thanks. And then for my follow-up one, perhaps for either of you again, how do we think about the OpEx side of things as we go through the year? And I know you purposely didn\\'t guide to it in your 2017 as a whole, but conceptually when you are launching a bunch of new products, is it fair to assume that the SG&A side of things to support those launches increases? Any sort of color you can give about your philosophy on OpEx will be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO, and Treasurer    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I think our philosophy, first of all, is to be very disciplined about managing the OpEx. We did that, as you saw, in the 2014/2015 time frame. In 2016, we made some very targeted investments to products, which is -- with the launches that are happening in 2017, I would say they are going to pay off in terms of all the products we have on track to launch in 2017.\\\\nWe have invested in software. We have got obviously some go-to-market expenses as we get into 2017. But I would say that you see our guidance for Q1 2017 at $360 million. So you will see a trend of continuing investment in product roadmap, new product launches, software.\\\\nR&D, if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, is up actually close to $50 million. And SG&A was down, even though we were essentially flat on OpEx 2015 to 2016. And I think as you look at 2017, we will continue to stay lean in SG&A and prioritize investments in R&D for the go-forward execution of our plans going into future years.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great, thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Chris Rolland, Susquehanna International Group.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group / SIG - Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the server side, you guys talked about \\\\\"Naples\\\\\". And Lisa, you mentioned more threads, higher memory, and I/O. With these products, do you anticipate taking more share in the cloud? Or how do you think you are going to fare versus enterprise storage comms, high performance? Is it going to be a lot more cloud-centric?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Chris, the great thing about \\\\\"Naples\\\\\" is it really is a general-purpose product, so we will play in all of those segments. I think the cloud tends to move a bit faster in terms of just, again, from design win to revenue. So we certainly are very focused in the cloud, but I\\'m also quite enthusiastic about our opportunities in traditional enterprise as well as some of the storage and networking spaces.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group / SIG - Analyst    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. And then with, let\\'s say, Summit Ridge and Vega and \\\\\"Naples\\\\\" all coming online here, can you guys talk about where these products -- the gross margins are versus either your corporate average or a comparable product now? And if things ramp the way you expect them to, when might you hit the low end of your long-term gross margin range?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So maybe, Chris, I will start and Devinder can add. Clearly you mentioned some of the key products that are margin drivers for us. So Ryzen in high-end desktop, our server CPUs, server GPUs, professional graphics are all north of the corporate average. We still have game consoles, which will be a significant piece of our business that will be less than corporate average.\\\\nSo our expectation is that we will make progress with margins as we ramp these products. Relative to when we will hit the long-term guidance, I think we will defer that perhaps to our analyst day and note that the target is still to be within the 36% to 40% range on a long-term model.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group / SIG - Analyst    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks so much and great quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Blayne Curtis, Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Hemmelgarn,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Thanks for very much for letting us on to ask a question, and congrats on the good quarter and guidance.\\\\nI guess first of all, a number of questions have touched on this, but with Ryzen launching and then Vega in Q2, you presumably see some pretty big channel fill in Q1 and into Q2. Could you just talk about how you see that impacting seasonality through the rest of the year. Q3, Q4 are normally bigger quarters for PC sales, but you got big product launches in the first half.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, we\\'re certainly looking forward to those product launches. And the way we view it is yes, there\\'s some bit of channel fill, but I think there\\'s also some pent-up demand for really great products in the gaming space. Both Ryzen and Vega are targeted at those enthusiast gamers. So certainly we do expect -- normal seasonality would say that the second half would be stronger.\\\\nNote that on Ryzen, we are starting first in the channel and with system integrators, and then OEMs will launch shortly thereafter. So you would expect a stage launch of our partners.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Hemmelgarn,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s very helpful, Lisa, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, so you have announced your first non-game console semi-custom win launching this year. As that business has matured, can you talk how you see further opportunities to grow outside of the core game console market there?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so we have talked about three design wins and those are in progress now. In terms of ongoing engagements, we have a nice pipeline. We continue to view semi-custom as a strategic way for us to utilize our IP in our design capability. And so we will continue to view that is one of our go-to-markets for the IP that we are developing. And we will talk more about the semi-custom opportunities as we go forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          John Pitzer, Credit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Good afternoon, guys. Lisa, congratulations on the strong results for 2016. I guess I wanted to go back with my first question to the OpEx line. If you just look at total dollars spent, you are spending well below your two main competitors.\\\\nAnd I\\'m just kind of curious. As revenue growth starts to reemerge in the model, how should you think about -- or how should we think about OpEx growth relative to revenue growth? Is there a target that you can give us that you\\'d like OpEx to grow half as fast as revenue?\\\\nOr are you at a point now where you see a lot of incremental investments that are worth doing that might have OpEx growth that are growing faster than that? Any guidance there would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, certainly, John. Look, I think we have shown that we can be very disciplined with OpEx, and I think we will ensure that -- OpEx will certainly not grow faster than revenue. So that won\\'t happen.\\\\nI think the opportunity for leverage does exist longer term in our model, but in the short term, I am very focused on ensuring that we execute our product roadmap really, really well. And so this year, it is about our product launches, making sure that we have the right software investments and go-to-market.\\\\nWe are going to see improvement in the financial performance as a result of the margin expansion. And we\\'ll look to find leverage on the OpEx line I think in the longer term as we continue to make progress. But again, we will be very disciplined on the OpEx line.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s helpful, Lisa. And then I guess as my second question, just going back on the gross margin for Ryzen and Vega. I guess can you help me understand, just given where in the stack those two parts will compete, why they shouldn\\'t have gross margins that are more comparable to your two closest peers. Is that kind of the internal target or is that how we should be thinking about it? Or any guidance there would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so I think for the high-end parts, both Ryzen and Vega, and \\\\\"Naples\\\\\", frankly, we should expect that they are well above our corporate average in terms of margin. As it relates to our competitors, I think that\\'s a harder question, but our goal is to make sure that we have very competitive product on a pure performance basis. And so that has been the goal, and that is certainly how we are viewing it.\\\\nBut we will also have some opportunity for price-performance leverage as we gain share in the market. So I think where we are positioning the products is the right place and the right balance between revenue growth and margin. And we will certainly look for every opportunity to improve our margins over time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess the question I get most frequently is Zen looks pretty exciting in 2017, but you are competing with Intel, who has got 10-nanometer product coming. How do we think about this on a multiyear basis, Zen as a springboard to compete with them? And anything you can share in terms of the product roadmap and the longer-term competitiveness of these products you are introducing now?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Joe. So look, we do think Zen is very, very competitive for where we are. In terms of our longer-term roadmap, I think, as with anything for top OEM customers, especially server data center customers, they are investing in a roadmap. So they are not just buying a point product. And we have a multigenerational roadmap that we are working on, including the Zen 2 and the Zen 3 follow-on.\\\\nFrom our standpoint, process technology, we ramped 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer really well last year and into this year. We are actually in the process of developing now in 7-nanometer and we think the 7-nanometer foundry roadmaps are available, are very competitive, and will ensure that we have a strong multigenerational roadmap.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great, thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Vijay Rakesh, Mizuho and Company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA - Analyst    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, guys. Sorry to beat upon this, but when you look at the Radeon Instinct GPUs and the Vega architecture in 2Q 2017 and first half 2017 here, are the gross margins more in the 40% to 60% range as they go into data center versus what your existing margins are?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, Vijay, I think it\\'s fair to say that both professional graphics and our Radeon Instinct line are higher than normal the GPU products -- the consumer GPU products in terms of margin. And now, we view the data center GPUs as a great growth opportunity for us. And so it\\'s a key area of focus.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA - Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And you mentioned GPUs seeing traction in multi-threaded applications. And so with that strength, there especially with [deplaning exit], what are your expectations for growth in that market if you were to -- obviously you are going from zero. But incrementally, what should that drive for -- in revenues for AMD? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So again, we view GPU servers as a very good growth opportunity for us. We are starting from a small base, but we have had some really good engagement with cloud customers. And we had some meaningful revenue in the second half of 2016, and we expect it to be a growth driver for us into 2017 and beyond.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Kevin Cassidy, Stifel.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking my question. On your Zen product lineup, you will have an APU in the second half of the year. And what kind of GPU does that have on it?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Kevin, we will have an APU, we call it Raven Ridge, in the second half of the year off of the Zen processor core. And we haven\\'t announced details of the graphics just yet.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Will that be targeted for both desktop and notebook?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, it will be. But it\\'s a very strong notebook part when you think about the high-end notebooks, two-in-ones and those types of things. But yes, it can also be used in desktop.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Ambrish Srivastava, BMO.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had a question on inventory, Devinder. You did give us the reason for why the inventory is higher. But what I\\'m trying to understand is why the delta between the guidance that you had given, which was supposed to be in the $660 million amount, which you guided to.\\\\nWas there a change in what you were expecting for the roadmap? Where there uncertainties that you had guided to $660 million, and now you came up to the number that you reported on the fourth quarter? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO, and Treasurer    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I think it\\'s fair to say that from the time I gave the guidance, $660 million coming into $750 million, that there were some changes, but let me explain.\\\\nFirst of all, it was higher than anticipated due to product ramps, product mix, and also our higher expected revenue in the first half of 2017. We also had an opportunity to purchase some inventory in a tight PC supply environment at commercially favorable terms. And we took the opportunity to go ahead and purchase the inventory, given what we see from a revenue standpoint for the first half of 2017.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Simona. As you know, we lowered our fourth quarter guidance on January 28, and our results are in line with our pre-announcement. Q4 revenue was $2.21 billion, down 24% from a year earlier, driven primarily by a 45% year-on-year decline in gaming. Full year revenue was $11.72 billion, up 21% from our previous year.\\\\nStarting with our gaming business. Revenue of $954 million was down 45% year-on-year and down 46% sequentially, weaker than our expectations heading into the quarter. Full year revenue was up 13% to $6.25 billion.\\\\nThree factors contributed to the Q4 gaming revenue decline. First, post-crypto inventory of GPUs in the channel caused us to reduce shipments in order to allow excess channel inventory to sell through. We expect channel inventories to normalize in Q1, in line with 1- to 2-quarter time line we had outlined on our previous earnings call. Second, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China, impacted consumer demand for our GPUs. And third, sales of certain high-end GPUs using our new Turing architecture, including the GeForce RTX 2080 and 2070, were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. These products deliver a revolutionary leap in performance and innovation with real-time ray tracing and AI, but some customers may have delayed their purchase while waiting for new -- for lower price points or further demonstration of the RTX technology in actual games. The significant volatility in our gaming business over the last few quarters has been challenging to model. Crypto mining demand and its after effects have distorted the quarter-to-quarter trends in the gaming business and obscured its underlying trend line.\\\\nLet me try to give you some visibility into what we believe the normalized business looks like. As you know, our gaming business consists of desktop gaming, notebook gaming and gaming console products. To get a sense of the underlying run rate in our gaming business last year, it is helpful to look at desktop gaming revenue across a period that doesn\\'t include crypto demand. Let\\'s look at the 4 quarters starting from Q2 of last year to the current quarter or Q1 this year.\\\\nIn Q2 and Q3 of last year, with the benefit of hindsight, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming products relative to where end demand turned out to be. To allow the channel to work down that excess channel inventory, we shipped a lower amount relative to end demand in Q4, and will do so again in Q1. Therefore, exiting Q1, we expect channel inventories to be at normal levels. On average, our desktop gaming revenue across these 4 quarters is about $900 million. We believe this represents the normalized level of desktop gaming for this period. Notebook gaming and gaming consoles have averaged close to $500 million per quarter over the same 4 quarters. Thus, in total, we believe our normalized quarterly gaming business revenue run rate is approximately $1.4 billion.\\\\nAs we look past Q1, we expect the channel inventory correction to be behind us and our business to have bottomed. On a full year basis, we expect our gaming business to be down slightly, given the tough first half compares with growth in Turing and notebook gaming.\\\\nAt CES last month, we launched into the recovery of our gaming business. We announced the GeForce RTX 2060 at the midrange price point of $349. The 2060 delivers a 60% performance improvement over the GTX 1060 while also bringing Turing\\'s real-time ray tracing and AI features to the mass market for the first time. The 2060 has received rave reviews and is off to a great start.\\\\nIn addition, we announced a record of 40-plus new Turing-based gaming laptops, which became available on January 29. This is more than double the number of GeForce-powered notebooks in the market last year, featuring the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture and the light laptops are able to deliver the performance of desktop gaming PCs. We expect GeForce laptops to continue to be the fastest-growing segment of gaming.\\\\nWe are also pleased to see growing momentum in the RTX ecosystem as more game developers are creating content to take advantage of the Turing architecture\\'s amazing capabilities. Just this week, DLSS technology is becoming available in 2 blockbuster games, Battlefield V and Metro Exodus and Anthem coming soon. In addition, at CES, Justice and Atomic Heart showed demos featuring ray tracing and DLSS. And a large pipeline of games plan to integrate RTX technology. Pairing DLSS with ray tracing can provide comparable frame rates to traditional rasterization but also much more beautiful cinematic visuals, the best of both worlds. This is the next generation of gaming. While this was a challenging quarter in our gaming business, we look forward to putting the channel inventory correction behind us and building on a solid foundation of our Turing architecture.\\\\nMoving to datacenter. Revenue was $679 million, up 12% year-on-year and down 14% sequentially. Full year datacenter revenue was $2.93 billion, up a strong 52%. The Q4 sales decline was broad-based across vertical end markets and geographies. As the quarter progressed, customers around the world became increasingly cautious, due to rising economic uncertainty and a number of deals did not close in January. In addition, hyperscale and cloud purchases declined both sequentially and year-on-year as several customers paused at the end of the year. We believe the pause is temporary. The strength of NVIDIA\\'s accelerated computing platform remains intact. We continue to lead the industry in performance for scientific computing and deep learning. And with CUDA\\'s programmability, we can continue to expand the value of our platform. For example, we recently announced RAPIDS or CUDA acceleration stack for data analytics and machine learning.\\\\nIn December, the first objective third-party AI benchmark called MLPerf became available, and NVIDIA captured the top spot in the 6 test categories for training deep learning models that we competed in. And in January, Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs are now available in beta in its datacenters in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, India, Singapore and Tokyo. The T4 is a universal cloud GPU that accelerates a variety of workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, broader machine learning, data analytics and graphics.\\\\nOur visibility remains low in the current cautious spending environment, and we don\\'t forecast a meaningful recovery in the data center segment until later in the year. However, we are working closely with hyperscales around the world to integrate NVIDIA TensorRT software and Tensor Core GPUs into their inference production flow. Inference currently drives less than 10% of our data center business, but represents a significant expansion of our addressable market opportunity going forward.\\\\nWe have also strengthened our product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities to address vertical industries that have an enormous data and analytics requirements, such as automotive, financial services, retail, health care and consumer Internet services. With our RAPIDS software stack, NVIDIA can accelerate data analytics and machine learning, and we have -- as we have done in deep learning. And we made it easier for customers to adopt our technology by partnering with Cisco, IBM, NetApp and Pure Storage to create pre-integrated systems that can be sold through their global IT channels.\\\\nMoving to pro visualization. Revenue reached $293 million, up 15% from the prior year and down 4% sequentially. Full year revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% year-on-year. New applications like data science, AI and VR as well as the need for thin and light mobile workstations remain key growth drivers for the business.\\\\nWe had key wins in the quarter, including Boeing, Google, LinkedIn and Toyota for applications including AI and robotics. This past week, with our partners, HP, Dell, Lenovo, we announced the availability of Quadro RTX workstations. Quadro RTX is the most significant workstation GPU upgrade in 10 years. It will enable millions of designers and creative architects for the first time to work interactively with super high resolution media and photorealistic 3D rendering, enabling them to be creative with dramatically improved productivity.\\\\nFinally, turning to automotive. Q4 revenue was $163 million, up 23% from a year ago and down 5% sequentially. Full year revenue reached $641 million, up 15%. The sequential decline was largely seasonal. The year-on-year growth was driven by the increasingly adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development deals, partially offset by declines in legacy infotainment.\\\\nLast month at CES, we announced DRIVE AutoPilot, the world\\'s first commercially available Level 2+ self-driving car computer. The system offers sophisticated automated driving features that far surpass today\\'s ADAS offerings, increasing the vehicle\\'s performance, functionality and road safety while the driver remains in control. We delivered these capabilities. DRIVE AutoPilot uses multiple deep neural networks; surround camera perception, both in and outside of the car; and significant AI processing capability. Systems from our Tier 1 partners, including Bosch, Continental, Veoneer and ZF were all on display on at our booths.\\\\nVolvo, as announced back in October, was our first Level 2+ design win with cars slated for production in the early 2020s. Mercedes-Benz has also chosen NVIDIA for its next-generation autonomous vehicle and cockpit computer. This centralized AI computing system replaces dozens of smaller processors inside current cars. DRIVE AutoPilot is a major milestone for NVIDIA and takes our high-functioning, self-driving capabilities into the mass market. This will be an important year for robo-taxi pilots and initial Level 2 design wins.\\\\nMoving to the rest of the P&L and balance sheet. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 54.7%. And non-GAAP was 56.0%, down sequentially and year-on-year, primarily due to a $128 million charge for DRAM, boards and other components associated with our lower-than-expected Q4 revenue and current market conditions.\\\\nGAAP operating expenses were $913 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $755 million, up 25% and 24% year-on-year, respectively. GAAP EPS was $0.92, down 48% from a year earlier. Full year GAAP EPS was $6.63, up 38% from the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 53% from a year ago. Full year non-GAAP EPS was $6.64, up 35% from the prior year.\\\\nWe returned $1.95 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. As we announced last quarter, we plan to return $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and buybacks. We repurchased $700 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect revenue to be $2.2 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.8% and 59%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $930 million and $755 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be an income of $20 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $170 million.\\\\nFor fiscal 2020, we expect Q1 to mark the bottom as we pass the inventory correction in gaming. We expect total revenue for the year to be flat to down slightly with growth in our 4 end markets, compensating for the absence of crypto revenue and the excess selling from last year. We plan to grow OpEx in the high single digits this year, and we continue to invest in our focused growth areas of graphics, AI and self-driving cars. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary, and other information is available on our IR website.\\\\nIn closing, I\\'d like to highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We\\'ll be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on February 26. And our next earnings call to discuss our financial results for the quarter of fiscal 2020 will take place on May 15.\\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had 2 questions. First, Colette, you talked about the weakness you saw in the 2070 and the 2080 in the quarter. I guess this question is more for Jensen. Are you concerned at all about your ability to convince and incentivize gamers to -- as Colette pointed out, it\\'s more of a timing thing? And second question is inventory was up on the balance sheet. Colette, if you can just provide some color there and expectations going forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Toshiya. When we launched the 2070 and 2080, it was the first time we\\'ve ever launched a new generation where the only available SKUs were very high end. And in addition to that, the early boards that came out into the marketplace were the special edition and the overclock versions, and the MSRP versions didn\\'t show up for some short time after, couple of months after. And so the conditions weren\\'t ideal, if you will. Now we weren\\'t able to launch into the mainstream segment with 2060 for all the reasons that I think everybody understands now. And so I think that the situation wasn\\'t ideal. When you take a look at our situation now, every single graphics card had the best performance at its price point, and it remain so today. And I think that right out of the box, it delivered excellent performance. It is true that everybody was hoping to see more games with RTX on day 1. But it\\'s such a new technology with ray tracing and AI for image processing that it\\'s only really possible to make available with new games, which is tied to the schedules of new games. And now they\\'re starting to come out. Battlefield V, Metro Exodus, I think the reviews from this week are just spectacular. People are finally realizing what it is that we were talking about. And that it\\'s possible with RTX technology, the combination of applying ray tracing and AI for us to deliver much more beautiful images without sacrificing performance. And so I think people are starting to understand now the benefits of the RTX technology. And we just needed some time to demonstrate it. And I think the takeaway is simply this. RTX is the best graphics card at every single price point without using ray tracing technology. And for new games that are coming out, each one of the new games that come out in the future will apply ray tracing, and work with developers to apply ray tracing technology. I think everybody agrees that it is surely the next generation. And then probably one of the biggest stories that came out just last week is Unreal Engine and Unity, both of the game engines are going to incorporate RTX and ray tracing technology in the engine itself. And so all future games in the future will be able to take advantage of that. So that\\'s a really big news, and I\\'m excited about that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So Toshiya, to answer your second question regarding our inventory balance. Our inventory balance at the end of Q4 rose just due to the weaker-than-expected finish to Q4. Inventory right now is primarily related to Turing, Volta and DGX. And we don\\'t expect any further write-downs as we have incorporated approximately $128 million of write-downs within the current Q4.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess on the commentary regarding a pause in spending in datacenter and a handful of deals that got delayed, can you give a little bit more color in terms of, I guess what you\\'re seeing across enterprise, cloud, high-performance compute? And I guess within that, how you\\'re seeing the ramp of T4? And I guess if you can kind of then speak to I\\'m sure embedded in the fiscal \\'20 guidance is a pretty nice ramp into the second half. What are the key drivers, key milestones that you\\'re looking for to see that business reaccelerate higher as we go through the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The slowdown is broad-based. We saw it across every vertical, every geography. There was just a level of cautiousness across all of the enterprise customers in the cloud service providers that we\\'ve not experienced in a while. And so I think that it has to be temporary. The computing needs of Earth has not certainly been satisfied with what we shipped last quarter. And so I think that the demand will return and customers will return. Our situation in datacenters is dramatically better year-over-year. And if you take a look at where we are, our deep learning solution is unquestionably the best in the world. We introduced T4 with inference capability. It\\'s the world\\'s first universal cloud GPU, and it does everything that NVIDIA does all in one GPU in 75 watts. And so it fits into every hyperscale datacenter. We\\'re engaged with Internet service providers all around the world, optimizing, importing their high-production models, networks, so that we could deploy it into production. So we now have 4 different new growth drivers for our data center in addition to deep learning and scientific computing. We have inference that we\\'re actively working on. We have data analytics that\\'s called RAPIDS. Some people call it big data, but data analytics and machine learning. The third is rendering. And because of the partnerships that we\\'ve developed and the excitement that people see around enterprises around the world, we\\'ve developed partnerships with large IT companies to pre-configure systems that make it easier for enterprises to be able to adopt our technology. So we have 4 new ways for us to grow our enterprise business. And so we\\'re looking forward to when the pause releases, and now we\\'ll get back to growing.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I just had a clarification and a question. On the clarification, gross margins, Colette, what is the normalized run rate for gross margin that as you get your sales back to normalized levels, how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins? And will there be any impact from the balance sheet inventory? And then on the question, Jensen, can you give us more reassurance that gaming is still a growth business? But I understand that over the last year, there\\'s been a lot of confusion, there\\'s been macro issues. But if you look at the number of gamers and the mix of product that they are buying, so essentially the sell-through to gamers, has that been on an upward trajectory? And as part of that, when do you think we could see Turing exceed the demand you saw for Pascal?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So I\\'ll go first. Thanks for the question. On gross margin, our gross margin, the largest contributor to our absolute gross margin is really just the mix of our products. The mix of our products based on our market platforms but also the mix of our products within data center as well as within gaming. We provided guidance for Q1, which has a good level of confidence from us, and we\\'ll see how it goes from there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Vivek, the fundamentals of gaming has not changed. There are more gamers than ever. Games are better than ever. There\\'s been a recent shift in the popularity of multiplayer competitive eSports-like games. That\\'s good for hardware. It lowers the barrier to entry because it\\'s free to play with the exception of downloadable content. And so the barriers to entry is lower. But you could see that the excitement around Fortnite and recently with Apex Legend, PUBG is still popular, League of Legends is still popular. And so this genre of games, these genre of games is both competitive, requires great hardware. It attracts a lot more players because it\\'s social, and you want to play with your friends. And it\\'s much stickier because it happens to be social. It happens to be a game where you had to play with a whole bunch of other people. So I think that gaming is vibrant as ever before. If you take the methodology that Colette described earlier and you averaged out our underlying gaming business and you compare that to a year before, surely it grew. If you compare that -- if you compare also the rate of which our gaming notebook is growing, I think that\\'s pretty exciting. I think last year, we had mentioned it before that our gaming notebook business grew 50% year-over-year. And just at CES, the number of new notebook designs that came out with Turing because of an invention that we created called Max-Q and because of the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture, you can now make notebooks that are really wonderful and also high performing at the same time. And so I think the dynamics are the same, and gaming is going to continue to be a growth business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Colette, I appreciate all the data you gave us on trying to size normalized demand for gaming. What I have to ask, though, is if you\\'re still going through of the channel inventory worked out in fiscal first quarter, it seems like to hit your full year guide, the expectation is for gaming revenue to accelerate well above that normalized level you talked about. One, am I doing the math right? And if I am, kind of what gives you confidence throughout the year that you can see that kind of gaming growth off of these bottoms?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'ll start, and I\\'ll let Jensen finish that question. So along the lines of Jensen\\'s response in terms of what we do believe are the key drivers of gaming and everything still intact in terms of gaming, both with our Turing architecture, the growth expected with our Turing architecture as well as the growth from the notebook, we do believe will be great drivers as we head into the rest of the year. We\\'ll have to wait and see in terms of how that plays out, but that is really the underlying reason why we think the growth will continue.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think your math isn\\'t wrong. The part that you probably didn\\'t consider is notebook. Our GeForce notebook business is quite large.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s helpful, Jensen. And then maybe just a follow-up, just on the data center side. Clearly, you\\'ve talked about new applications that should help grow your TAM inside of datacenter. I\\'m just kind of curious, the calendar fourth quarter of last year, I think marked the first time that a competitor had some meaningful volumes of GPU in the datacenter. There\\'s always talk about the hyperscale guys are wanting to do their own ASICs. What kind of anecdotal evidence can you give us to help us get more comfortable of what\\'s going on here is more macro and not share loss either to competition and/or architectural differences between GPUs and ASICs?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We don\\'t see them in high-performance computing. And so I haven\\'t found where -- we haven\\'t met them in high-performance computing and deep learning and in the areas that we serve. And so competitively, I can\\'t -- I don\\'t really -- we don\\'t see it. But the bigger picture, I think is this, that the market segments that we serve, whether it\\'s in deep learning, machine learning, data analytics, those segments are really quite large. And I think that it is, unquestionably, the future of high-performance computing is going to be highly data driven, both computational methods, algorithmic methods as well as data-driven methods. And so I think the fundamental trend has not changed. We have 4 new growth drivers, 4 new ways to grow in the datacenter. The first one, of course, is inference. We\\'re making a lot of progress there. T4 is doing great. I think we\\'re going to be quite successful with T4s. You just got to keep saying that. It has second-generation Tensor Core, 75 watts. And you can use that for training. You can use it for inference. You could use it for remote graphics. You could use it for high-performance computing. And it fits literally into any hyperscale data center. The second way is data analytics. This is a brand-new thing for us. You must know that big data and using data to predict dynamics in the marketplace is really important in retail, in e-tail, in health care, in financial services. And there\\'s never been an accelerated approach to solve this problem for people. And because of the flexibility of CUDA and because of the performance of our architecture, over the course of last year, we reengineered the entire data analytics stack, so that we can accelerate it. It\\'s called RAPIDS. That work is really, really important, and I hope to give you guys updates on that on a regular basis. Rendering is a brand-new market for us because of Turing. Finally, we can render photorealistic images in accelerated way. There are millions of servers in the world that are driving render farms, and they\\'re getting upgraded on a regular basis. And then lastly, we\\'ve been successful with CSPs because they\\'re easy for us to reach. But the world\\'s enterprises are far and many and they\\'re giant industries. And our companies\\' sales coverage doesn\\'t allow us to reach every single health care company and every single insurance company and retail company. And that\\'s where our network of partners really come in. We have great partnerships with HP. We have great partnerships with Dell and Cisco and IBM. And now we\\'ve developed relationships with the storage vendors, so that -- and the reason for that is because most of these big data problems require a great deal of storage. And they both -- they all see, they see the opportunities that we\\'ve created. And we came together to create pre-configured systems that are optimized and tuned, and these high-performance systems that you can just bring into the company, prop up and install. And we\\'re seeing a lot of great success with that. And so we have 4 different ways to grow our datacenter business, and we\\'re enthusiastic about it. I\\'m optimistic about it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First I had a clarification, Colette. I just wanted to clarify what the mix is assumed for the fiscal Q1 guidance? Are you kind of assuming that datacenter and gaming are both kind of flat sequentially? And then I guess my question was can you help us sort of shape the revenue through the year? To get to your full year guidance, you have to add roughly maybe $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion from where you are in fiscal Q1. How does that shape through the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Our guidance for the next quarter is a makeup of many different types of options across our market segment. We feel confident in terms of that roll-up, as we\\'ve provided the guidance today. And we\\'ll just have to see how that ends out. With the expectation that we will be flat or slightly down for the full year, you are correct in some case that we\\'re growing to have to build up to that over the course of the several next quarters. Likely, the second half of the year, we\\'ll definitely be stronger than the first half of the year, and that is our expectation at this time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Tim, one of the things to keep in mind is that we have 4 growth drivers. We have 4 growth businesses. Our datacenter business is growing. It\\'s unquestionably that our footprint is larger than ever. Our pro viz business is growing. Our workstation business now has 3 ways to grow. One is rendering. The second is data science -- data scientists are now a workstation customer. That has never happened before. And our software stack with Turing, turns a workstation into an ideal data science workstation. And the third is, finally, we\\'re able to make workstations into notebooks. And they\\'re delightfully thin, using all the same technologies that talked about for gaming notebooks. And so workstations is a growth business. And then lastly, our automotive is going to be a growth business. We\\'ve been investing, as you know, in self-driving cars. And this year, we announced entry into Level 2+, our first foot into the mainstream marketplace of autonomous vehicles. And the first design win is Volvo, and we have others to announce. And so I think this is going to be a good year for self-driving cars as well. So we have 4 growth businesses. Our 4 core businesses are all growing.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First, I wanted to get again at the mix. Colette, you -- this is a question for Colette. You have said that mix was going to be the primary driver of your gross margins. And I know that sequentially they\\'re up, but if I correct for the inventory write-down in Q4, the normalized gross margin this quarter was 61.7%. And so you\\'re guiding it to 59%, so it\\'s down 270 basis points sequentially on flat revenues. So do I take from that guidance that that\\'s an indicator of the mix between the businesses, it\\'s the primary driver of that gross margin degradation? Is there something else going on that we should be aware of?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Stacy, we\\'ll start with that first question on gross margin. You\\'re correct, mix is still the primary driver of our gross margin every single quarter. You have correctly reduced -- or excuse me, changed our Q4 numbers to remove the overall inventory write-down. So when you look at Q1, there is a mix around our products that we plan on shipping by platforms but also within our gaming business and within our data center business. We also have different gross margins that would influence. This is our best estimate that we have at this time, and we\\'ll see as we move through the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So what do you think the bigger -- between those 2, whether it\\'s intra-business mix or inter-business mix, between the businesses or within the businesses, which one of those is the biggest driver of the gross margin degradation sequentially into Q1?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think it\\'s more on the inter business. Now keep in mind, our Q4 has a very low percentage of gaming as a total in terms of there and then a different mix within there as we move to the next quarter as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So you think it\\'s the mix between the businesses within, like you said inter, is that mix between the businesses that you think is the bigger driver then?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The mix of the intra, both within the segments as well as between the segments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. For my follow-up, Jensen, you and Colette, I guess you mentioned the datacenter was growing. But if I got full year revenue sort of flat to down slightly, and I\\'ve got gaming revenues down a bit like you said and I have pro viz and auto growing, it\\'s kind of really hard for me within the envelope of that guidance to get datacenter growing much if at all. I mean, it could even be down within that. I mean, how are you thinking about the idea of datacenter growing within the context of the full year guidance that you\\'ve given?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, in the short term, in near term, we have relatively limited visibility. We don\\'t think it\\'s going to remain this way. And with a little bit of tailwind, I think we could have a fairly good year. And so we\\'ll just see how it turns out. This is our year guidance for now, and we\\'ll update you as we go. The fundamental dynamics doesn\\'t change. The fact of the matter is the world needs more computing. And a lot of that computing is related to machine learning, data analytics, deep learning. It\\'s related to the things that we\\'re working on. And we have 4 new ways to grow our datacenter business. I think our deep learning position is as good as ever. Our scientific computing position is as good as ever. And we have 4 new ways to grow. We have inference, we have data analytics and machine learning. We have rendering. And now we\\'re taking that entire stack to the enterprise. And so I think we have the right strategy. We have the best platform. And the utilization -- the utility of it is really fantastic. And so with a little bit of a tailwind, I think we could have a fairly good year, and we\\'ll just report it as we go.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wanted to ask about again, competition in datacenter. AMD on their call had talked about graphics in their datacenter business being as big as server, which is sort of north of $100 million a quarter, which surprised me. My sense is they\\'re doing quite a bit different applications than you guys are. But maybe if you can just give us some context around what they\\'re doing and how you see the competition coming up from within other graphics vendors.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our data center business is really focused on computing, and we just don\\'t -- we don\\'t see anybody. Our primary competitor is CPUs. That\\'s really the starting of it and the ending of it. And it\\'s very clear. The vast majority of the world\\'s data center only runs on CPUs today. But the advance of technology has slowed. And it\\'s creeping along at a few percent a year, and unfortunately, that\\'s just not good enough. And so either datacenters are going to continue to increase in CapEx or they\\'re going to have to find a new approach. And I think people are fairly enthusiastic about University, about accelerated computing. And I think our position is really quite good. And so I would say that those are largely the positions. If you think about competitively comparing our GPU to a competitor\\'s latest GPU, I think the expectation was really high, and didn\\'t turn out quite that way. I think our -- we\\'ve established that the Turing energy efficiency is much better. I think we\\'ve established that NVIDIA\\'s Tensor Core architecture as a result allows our Volta to be 4x the performance of the highest end of the alternative. And the T4 is 1/4 the power at the same performance. And so the benefit of having great architectural advantage is a really rich software stack, and engineering that resulted in the energy efficiency that we\\'ve achieved, generation in, generation out, I think those are really great advantages. And then lastly, because of the broad reach of our architecture and OEM or a cloud service provider can adopt our architecture, and the utility of it is going to be greater because there\\'s just a lot more applications. And the best way to reduce cost for any utility is to increase its utility. And I think that that\\'s -- that our position there is really strong as you could imagine.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have just a couple of questions. The first one, Jensen, it seemed like the Turing platform is delivering some amazing results. But as you talked about relying on some new software features to do it. I wonder if you might talk about any steps you\\'re taking in the road map to really upgrade performance for the installed base of games, given the time that it might take for some of those software features to roll out. And then secondly, you noted in the pre-announcement something about the write-down having to do with DRAM. I mean, obviously, that commodity pricing has been volatile. Colette, is there anything you can talk about, about how big of an effect that might have on the business and on pricing overall?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks a lot, Matt. First of all, the Turing architecture is the highest-performing architecture at every single price point. And it\\'s a big jump from our last generation in every single way. Without ray tracing, the Turing architecture is the first GPU to do concurrent floating point and integer operations at the same time. The instruction per clock of the Turing processor is so much better than our last generation, so much better than what\\'s available in the marketplace. The cache architecture is a big improvement, and you can just see it in all of the existing games. If you just measure the existing games without touching anything, Turing gives you a big boost. And that\\'s before we talked about ray tracing. And we\\'ve already spoken about ray tracing earlier, Matt. And we know that every single game that are coming out, we\\'re working with the developers to incorporate RTX technology. And a very, very big deal, both Epic with Unreal engine and Unity engine are going to incorporate Ray tracing. It is very, very clear that the next generation of computer graphics is ray tracing. And all of the work that we\\'ve done with RTX to move the industry forward is well worth it. But remember, that\\'s just the graphics part of Turing. Turing comes with it several new opportunities for growth for us. The first is, of course, advancing games. Advancing games for notebooks, advancing computer graphics, photorealistic rendering for film. All the work that we\\'ve done with Tensor Core that we just talked about. It\\'s our second-generation Tensor Core, making it great for training as well as inference, a big leap for us for inference. And then lastly, all of the work that we\\'re doing for data analytics and machine learning, we\\'ll take advantage of all the capabilities of Turing. And so Turing is a big deal for us. And that\\'s one of the reasons why last year was so busy for us as we put Turing into workstations, into data centers, into clouds, into rendering, into video games. And so Turing is really a gigantic leap for us architecturally. We\\'re really excited by it. It\\'s -- I think that the turbulent Q4 kind of overshadowed all of it. But in the final analysis, I think Turing was a home run for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And to also answer your question regarding DRAM prices. Yes, they have definitely been volatile over the historical period. It is great to see them coming down in price. Over the long term, yes, that is beneficial to us from a gross margin perspective. So if we look out to the horizon later, we will probably be able to incorporate that into our gross margins.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Kind of building on the discussion around the Turing platform and particularly to the gaming market, I\\'m curious, you mentioned in your prepared comments pricing of these new solutions was a bit of an inhibitor. Has the company invoked any changes in their pricing strategy around Turing? And then also, I\\'d be interested at can you help us frame how important China is to the gaming segment? And whether or not you\\'re assuming that the China market rebounds in your annual assumption?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First of all, on the pricing part, the biggest inhibitor was that we didn\\'t have -- we couldn\\'t launch our midrange segment. The inability to launch 2060 was a big inhibitor for us. But we did so at CES. The launch is a great success. The reviews are fantastic. People loved 2060. The price point is great. And so now we have a great stack from the midrange all the way to enthusiasts. The other part which could have turned out better is at the time of the launch, there were so many special editions and there were so many overclocked versions that the price point appeared high. But now while we have MSRP pricing for all of our segments. And so that\\'s terrific. China is an important market. China is an important market, and it\\'s an important gaming market. And I have every confidence it\\'s going to rebound.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Could you just -- a clarification, could you repeat what you said you thought the OpEx would grow in this fiscal year? And what is the -- where\\'s the focus of that investment? To what extent is it R&D versus SG&A? And then maybe one layer deeper, where is the focus of the higher OpEx?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, I\\'ll start off. To repeat what we indicated in our transcript, we plan to increase OpEx in the high single digits over where we finished in terms of fiscal year \\'19. That is related to our opportunities that we see in front of us, gaming, AI as well as self-driving cars. Our focus in terms of investment, we are a very R&D-heavy significant company. But there are investments across the board, both in R&D as well as what we need in terms of go-to-market strategies to obtain these higher markets in front of us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So I don\\'t want to poke too many holes on the memory side and the downturn in gaming due to the crypto inventory. But if I think about kind of the gross margin profile, you guys almost reached 65%. So if I look out, let\\'s call it a year or even call it 18 months and make it a -- more of a kind of a long-term target, is there any reason why you guys can\\'t get back up to kind of the mid-60s level?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. On your gross margin question, yes, we still have drivers within the mix of our products that allow us to grow our gross margin over the long term. Absolutely. And there is definitely a goal for us to continue doing that. So the focus in terms of what the cost components of what we do but also moving the entire portfolio into the higher value-added platforms that we sell. So over the long term, absolutely, all of those things are still in place and intact that we can do. And we\\'ll look quarter to quarter to give the best guidance that we can to help you see that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Obviously, a pause in datacenter, particularly the hyperscale, is pretty well documented. I\\'m just kind of curious to your perspective, particularly being AI still a growth area versus -- or run rate being memory and CPUs. Can you give any perspective as to how widespread it is? Maybe number of customers or geographic perspective. And just kind of curious how AI is affected with this greater slowdown.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Blayne, the hyperscalers, their pause is probably the most dramatic. We still see a lot of activity in enterprise. It\\'s just a much smaller base for us, but we expect it to be a much larger base in the future. And the reason for that is because most of the enterprises today don\\'t use deep learning, they use an approach called machine learning. They might use things like decision trees or graph analytics or regressions or clustering or things like that, algorithms like that. And they\\'ll run data analytics applications for business intelligence on a large amount of data. And they might be running it on a -- on top of a Spark stack that was created out of Berkeley and open source from Databricks. And so there\\'s a -- if you recognize some of these things, that\\'s what health care companies do and financial services companies do and retail companies do. They use it for fraud detection, predicting inventory, trying to make the best matches between riders and drivers and trying to predict which route to take to deliver food, dinner to you. And so those kinds of applications, most of the developers today use machine learning in large -- and big data analytics. And so we invested in a stack called RAPIDS and built our architecture called T4. And we\\'re in the process of partnering with large IT companies to take the stack and the solution out to the world\\'s enterprise. And so I expect enterprise to be a fairly exciting growth opportunity for us. Meanwhile, the CSPs, their pause will end. The amount of computation they do is increasing. More and more of them are using deep learning. And we have inference opportunity with the work that we did with T4 and TensorRT. And so we\\'ve got a lot of exciting opportunities to go.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nPierre C. Ferragu,  New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          A question for Colette. I\\'m trying to figure out how your position with cloud data centers evolved last year in financial year 2019. So if I look at the cloud CapEx, they were up about 70%. If I look at the CPU going into the cloud, according to Intel, it was up about 60%. So I was wondering how much you guys have been increasing revenues within your cloud business? Did you grow faster than CPUs? Did you grow faster than the overall CapEx? And then I have a follow-up in 2020.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Let me start on that piece. As we talked about earlier on the call, our hyperscale and our hyperscales, many of them are also cloud providers, did start to slow down in terms of their purchasing in the latter half of the year. But the overall growth rate, as you can see from our data center business, grew more than 50% for the full year. Now even with that strong growth, we are still a very small percentage of overall CapEx that we see in cloud providers or the overall hyperscales. We are likely one of their top priorities of areas where they need to grow in terms of in their data center as they focus on AI, as they focus on the cloud businesses and the importance of that compute is necessary. But we are still a very, very small percentage of it. So slow down in the second half of the year, full year growth, phenomenal growth of 50%. And we track with the (inaudible).\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nPierre C. Ferragu,  New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          But this 50% growth, is that for your overall datacenter business? Is that what like specifically your cloud hyperscale business grew as well? Or did that grow even faster with that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, depending on the quarter, we will have a mix of what is hyperscale growth or what is cloud. And again, in the core -- in the fourth quarter, that was not a growth opportunity for us. But earlier in the year, definitely it was.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nPierre C. Ferragu,  New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And then quickly maybe, Jensen, on 2020, so you seem to be very cautious on the datacenter outlook. When we listen to players like Google and Facebook and others, they all seem to be seem like very keen to grow their overall spending this year. And when we listen to other providers around you, they all seem to be -- I mean they all demonstrate a bit of a confidence that in the second half, spending should resume. Is that just because they are being more optimistic than you? Do they see something you don\\'t see? What do you hear from your clients about the second half?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, we\\'re enthusiastic about the second half. We\\'re enthusiastic about our position, and we\\'re enthusiastic about the solution we offer. And Pierre, as you know, we\\'ve also expanded our application and our market reach. We guided -- I think probably the biggest takeaway is we guided flight to slightly down for the whole year for the whole number. We do have 4 growth drivers. And maybe the best way to think about it is we should just wait and see how it goes. I think we\\'ve -- considering where we are, I feel pretty good about our guidance, and -- but I feel even better about our strategic position. And so I look forward to working through the year with you guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your last question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the China gaming weakness, is it the slower economic environment? Or is it sort of government policy related? Because we know that the China government has had a freeze on new gaming approvals, although they\\'ve recently started to approve new games. This ban is in place, I think since the first half of last year. So given what you know of the business, how much of the China weakness is coming from the China gaming bans? Or is this just overall slower economic environment?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I don\\'t know that we could tear that apart, tease that apart, Harlan. We just know that China, the consumer market is relatively slow towards the end of the year. But the China economy is in the final analysis of growth economy, and so we\\'re looking forward to it recovering. And gaming is one of the most important pastimes of that culture, and so I\\'m excited about our prospects there. All of the things that we\\'re seeing in the near term, Colette, has done a really good job describing. And as we leave the bottom and leave this inventory issue behind us, we\\'re super well positioned. We have a full stack of RTX, the Turing architecture is fantastic. It is unquestionably the best in the world. We have the best performance at every single price point. And we have great notebooks that the market can now buy. And so I\\'m looking forward to reporting our status with you guys as the year goes on. This should be a good year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          2018 was a record year, but it was a disappointing finish. This quarter, we expect to put the channel inventory issue behind us and get back on track. As the pioneer of accelerated computing, our position is unique and strong. And the opportunities ahead in graphics, high-performance computing, AI and autonomous machines remain enormous. We are as enthusiastic about these growth opportunities as ever. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And this concludes today\\'s conference call.

Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 2018 marked another year of strong financial performance, driven by our expanded high-performance product portfolio despite near-term graphics weakness. We grew annual revenue by 23%, with Ryzen, EPYC and data center GPU product revenue growing by more than $1.2 billion for the year. Our new products gained share and significantly expanded gross margin, leading to our most profitable year since 2011. \\\\nLooking at the fourth quarter, revenue of $1.42 billion increased 6% from a year ago, with approximately 65% of sales coming from our new products. We reached an important milestone in our business in the quarter as our high-margin data center CPUs and GPUs accounted for a mid-teens percentage of overall revenue. While we expect our data center revenue to be lumpy, the ramp of our data center business is beginning to contribute meaningfully to our financial results. \\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we delivered our eighth straight quarter of year-over-year segment revenue growth. Sales of Ryzen desktop and notebook processors and data center GPUs offset lower GPU sales as the channel continued working through elevated levels of graphics inventory. Client processor unit shipments grew by more than 50% from the year-ago period. We had our highest client computing revenue in more than 4 years, and we believe we gained client CPU unit share for the fifth straight quarter. \\\\nAt CES, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Huawei, Lenovo and Samsung, all launched notebooks powered by our new second-generation Ryzen mobile processor with Radeon Vega graphics. The second-gen Ryzen mobile processor delivers more performance, enhanced features and longer battery life than any mobile processor we have ever built and is the fastest processor available for ultrathin notebooks. \\\\nThe industry\\'s first AMD-based Chromebooks launched earlier this quarter from Acer and HP. We expect additional AMD-based Chromebooks to launch later this year as we expand our participation in this growing portion of the PC market. \\\\nBased on the competitive positioning of our Ryzen processors, we expect the number of Ryzen systems that we\\'ll launch in 2019 to increase by more than 30% from 2018, with a number of Ryzen notebook systems planned to launch increasing by more than 50%. \\\\nIn graphics, GPU revenue decreased year-over-year, driven largely by lower channel GPU and memory sales, partially offset by a significant increase in data center GPU sales. We saw an improvement in channel GPU sellouts throughout the quarter as our partners continue to drain their inventory. There is still more work to do, but we remain confident we\\'re taking the right actions to further reduce channel inventory. \\\\nWe set a record for professional GPU revenue in the quarter, driven by multiple high-volume wins for our Vega-based data center GPUs. We started shipping our new 7-nanometer Radeon Instinct accelerators in the quarter and introduced a major set of enhancements to our data center GPU software that make it easier for customers to deploy Radeon GPUs for AI and machine learning workloads. \\\\nAt CES, we highlighted the significant gaming momentum we are generating for Radeon across consoles, PCs and the cloud. For gamers and creators, we announced our return to the high-end GPU market with the new Radeon VII GPU. Powered by our second-generation Vega graphics core and featuring 16 gigabytes of second-generation high-bandwidth memory, our new 7-nanometer Radeon VII GPU delivers leadership performance in content creation and compute workloads, and is very competitively positioned when running the most demanding AAA games at 4K resolution. In cloud gaming, we announced that Google selected Radeon Pro GPUs to power their game streaming initiative, Project Stream. The performance and differentiated virtualization features of our Radeon Pro GPUs enabled Google to deliver an uncompromised high definition gaming experience on virtually any PC. \\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, revenue was flat from a year ago as a double-digit percentage decrease in semi-custom revenue was offset by strong growth in EPYC processor sales. As expected, semi-custom sales were down from a year ago based on where we are in the current console cycle. This console generation remains one of the most successful ever as Microsoft and Sony combined have now shipped well in excess of 120 million AMD-powered consoles. Fourth quarter server unit shipments more than doubled sequentially based on growing demand for our highest-end 32-core EPYC processors with cloud, HPC and virtualized enterprise customers. As a result, we believe we achieved our goal of mid-single-digit server unit share exiting 2018. \\\\nWe had another strong quarter of cloud adoption, highlighted by industry-leader Amazon announcing new versions of their most popular EC2 computing instances powered by EPYC processors. Businesses can easily migrate their AWS instances to AMD and save 10% or more based on the technology advantages of our platform. \\\\nMicrosoft Azure also announced general availability of their AMD-based storage instance in the quarter as well as a new HPC instance, powered by EPYC processors that is 33% faster than competitive x86 offerings. We secured multiple HPC wins in the quarter, including Procter & Gamble, the U.S. Department of Energy and one of Europe\\'s largest supercomputers at the University of Stuttgart\\'s High-Performance Computing Center. Lawrence Livermore labs also announced a new supercomputer featuring both EPYC processors and Radeon Instinct accelerators that will be used for machine learning and big data analytics workloads. \\\\nCustomer interest in our next-generation Rome server processor remains very high. Rome is expected to deliver 4x the floating-point performance and double the compute performance per socket compared to our current-generation EPYC processors. We publicly demonstrated a single 64-core next-generation EPYC processor outperforming 2 of our competitors\\' highest-end server processors in multiple workloads. Rome development is proceeding very well, and we are on track to start shipments midyear. \\\\nI am also pleased to report that we concluded discussions with GLOBALFOUNDRIES on the seventh amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement. The amendment affirms the strategic partnership with GF for products built at 12-nanometers and above and provides AMD with full sourcing flexibility at the 7-nanometer and below nodes. GF continues to be a critical supplier of AMD\\'s current-generation products and will play a key role in our next-generation Ryzen and EPYC products with our triplet strategy. \\\\nIn summary, 2018 was another strong year for AMD. Increased adoption of our high-performance products drove a second straight year of double-digit annual revenue growth, expanded gross margins and improved profitability. I would like to thank the more than 10,000 AMD employees whose dedication to building great products have made these results possible. \\\\nWhile headwinds remain in the graphics channel and macro uncertainties are causing some caution in the first half of 2019, we believe we are well positioned to gain share throughout the year and accelerate growth as we ramp our next-generation 7-nanometer products. \\\\nAs we enter 2019, we are preparing to launch our strongest product portfolio ever. In gaming, we will launch our high-end Radeon VII GPU in February, followed by our next-generation Navi GPUs later in the year. In client computing, we started the year with our second-generation Ryzen mobile processors, and we are on track to launch our third-generation Ryzen desktop processors in the middle of the year. And in the server market, we expect to deliver a significant step function performance increase with the launch of our next-generation Rome processors in the middle of the year. \\\\nI am very proud of what we accomplished in 2018 and even more excited about how our long-term investments are set to pay off in 2019. \\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2018 was a strong year for AMD. New product introductions wrought the highest annual revenue since 2011 and a significant improvement in gross margin year-over-year. Earnings per share increased from $0.10 per share in 2017 to $0.46 per share in 2018. Full year 2018 revenue was $6.48 billion, up 23% year-on-year, driven by strong performance in the Computing and Graphics segment with significant growth in Ryzen processor sales. Although there was weakness in the graphics channel in the second half of the year, we saw strength in data center CPUs and GPUs. Gross margin was 39%, up 440 basis points from the prior year. Gross margin improvements are primarily driven by our new Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon products. Operating expenses were 29% of revenue, an improvement of 2 percentage points from the prior year. For the full year, operating income was $633 million, up $409 million from $224 million in the prior year. Net income was $514 million, up $411 million, compared to net income of $103 million in the prior year. On the balance sheet, we reduced principal debt by $171 million and improved gross leverage significantly from 4.6x a year ago to 1.9x at the end of 2018. \\\\nLet me turn to the details of the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter revenue gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share all improved year-on-year. Quarterly revenue of $1.42 billion was up 6% from a year ago. Strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and data center GPUs more than offset lower channel GPU and semi-custom sales during the quarter. Fourth quarter 2018 revenue did not include any IP-related revenue, and blockchain-related GPU revenue was negligible. \\\\nGross margin was 41%, up 740 basis points from 34% a year ago. Year-on-year gross margin improvement was driven primarily by the ramp of Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. Gross margin has increased year-over-year for 7 consecutive quarters, driven by a higher percentage of revenue from new products. Fourth quarter 2018 gross margin excludes a $45 million write-down of all the technology licenses that are no longer being used. Operating expenses grew 9% year-over-year to $474 million and remained approximately flat as a percentage of revenue from the year-ago period. We continue to invest in our product road map and go-to-market activities as we gain market share in important markets. \\\\nOperating income was $109 million, up $90 million from $19 million a year ago. Operating margin was 8%, up from less than 2% last year. Net income was $87 million compared to $8 million a year ago. Q4 2018 net income excludes a withholding tax refund plus interest of $43 million related to an IP litigation settlement from 2010. Diluted earnings per share using a diluted share count of 1,180,000,000 was $0.08 per share compared to $0.01 per share a year ago. \\\\nNow turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $986 million, up 9% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by continued strong Ryzen desktop product sales and the adoption of second-generation Ryzen mobile processors, largely offset by lower channel GPU and memory sales compared to the prior year. Ryzen products continued to ramp and were greater than 80% of total client revenue, driven by OEM and channel momentum. In graphics, sales were down year-over-year due to negligible blockchain-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as elevated levels of [tropics] inventory in the channel. Total graphics revenue grew sequentially, driven by strong Radeon data center GPU sales. \\\\nComputing and Graphics operating segment income was $115 million compared to $33 million a year ago. The increase was driven primarily by strength in Ryzen product sales and significantly higher ASPs in both desktop and notebook compared to a year ago. \\\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $433 million, flat from the prior year. Server revenue growth was offset by lower semi-custom revenue. EPYC processor units more than doubled sequentially, driving significant growth in data center revenue in the quarter. EESC segment operating loss was $6 million compared to a loss of $13 million a year ago. The improvement due to higher EPYC processor revenue was partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue and continued engineering and go-to-market investments in the server business. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.16 billion at the end of the quarter. We generated free cash flow of $79 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $129 million for the full year primarily due to growth in inventory related to new products and the timing of collections. Inventory was $845 million, up $107 million sequentially, primarily due to the ramp of new products. Total principal debt was $1.5 billion as we further reduced term debt by $60 million during the [fourth]  quarter, resulting in total debt reduction of $171 million during 2018. We expect to pay off the remaining $66 million of 2019 term debt in March 2019, and beyond that, there are no long-term debt maturities until 2022. \\\\nAdjusted EBITDA was $152 million compared to $58 million a year ago, and on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $803 million, more than doubling year-over-year. Gross leverage was 1.9x as we ended 2018, and we are pleased to have achieved our long-term gross leverage target of less than 2x. \\\\nBefore turning to our financial outlook, let me discuss our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Today, the seventh amendment of the WSA spans from January 2019 through March 2024. It establishes purchase commitments and pricing at 12-nanometer and above for the years 2019 through 2021. The amendment also provides AMD full sourcing flexibility at 7-nanometer and beyond without any onetime payments or royalties for products purchased from other foundries. \\\\nTurning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.25 billion plus or minus $50 million, a decrease of approximately 12% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease is expected to be primarily driven by continued softness in the graphics channel and seasonality across the business. The year-over-year decrease is expected to be primarily driven by lower graphics sales due to excess channel inventory, the absence of blockchain-related GPU revenue and lower memory sales. In addition, semi-custom revenue is expected to be lower year-over-year while Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon data center GPU product sales are expected to increase. In addition, for Q1 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $480 million, non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately $25 million, and we also expect to record a $60 million IP licensing gain associated with the THATIC JV in the first quarter of 2019, which will be a benefit to operating income and recorded on the licensing gain line of the P&L. \\\\nFor the full year 2019, despite near-term weakness in the graphics channel and a cautious macro environment, we expect high single-digit percentage revenue growth driven by Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon data center GPU product sales and as we ramp our 7-nanometer products throughout the year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 41%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 29% of revenue and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 4% of pretax income. \\\\nIn closing, we made excellent progress in 2018. We grew the top line by more than $1.2 billion, expanded gross margin and significantly improved profitability. We continue to execute our long-term financial model, driven by our new high-performance computing products that gained solid momentum last year. We are pleased to enter 2019 with a strengthened balance sheet and a strong portfolio of next-generation products capable of driving continued financial growth. \\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready for our first question, please?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I had a question on your full year 2019 outlook. You guys are guiding revenue growth kind of in the high single-digit range. Embedded in that outlook, what kind of growth rates are you assuming for your core businesses, computing, graphics, semi-custom and server CPUs? And then on the gross margin side, 41% or greater, is the improvement year-over-year primarily a function of revenue growth and mix? Or is the amendment in the WSA playing a role there as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thank you for the questions. So relative to the full year guidance of up high single digits, the primary growth drivers are Ryzen and EPYC, are the 2 largest growth drivers. With data center GPU also, we\\'re expecting that to be up. And then we would expect that semi-custom will be down. If you look at the life cycle, semi-custom will be in the seventh year of the console cycle, and so we expect semi-custom to be down approximately 20% and then we would expect consumer graphics to also be down, let\\'s call it, double digits as we really burn off some of the channel inventory that we see in the first half of the year. So Ryzen and EPYC are the large drivers of the growth. And that\\'s as we launch our 7-nanometer products throughout the year. And then your second question, Toshi, was?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, in gross margins, 41% or greater, that\\'s 2 percentage point or greater improvement year-over-year. Is that primarily a function of revenue growth and improvement in mix, given Ryzen and EPYC? Or is the WSA amendment providing a tailwind as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, it\\'s primarily due to mix. So the mix of the higher-margin new products, Ryzen, EPYC, and the data center GPUs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, please?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen and Company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I guess, I wanted to attack Toshi\\'s question on the full year a little bit differently and maybe just talk about a little bit what share gain assumptions you guys are embedding for your 7-nanometer road map versus maybe some pragmatism or conservatism on the market just given the macro. I mean, Intel talked about a flat PC TAM in terms of units. And obviously, it\\'s only, I guess, guided us to mid-single-digit growth for their sort of expansive server business for the year, and you guys are starting off down maybe 25% year-over-year in revenue for the first quarter given what\\'s going on in the graphics business. So maybe you could just walk us through a little bit what you\\'re thinking about the TAM growth of your 2 main growth markets for the year versus share gains you\\'re embedding.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Matt. Look, I think, as it relates to the market, I don\\'t think we would have a very different view of the market as others may have stated. Our story really is a share gain story. And when you take a look at sort of the progress that we\\'d made in 2018 and the design wins that we had in 2018, as we go over to 2019, when we look at both Rome as well as Ryzen, we look at sort of the breadth of OEM platforms that we have, the customer engagements by workload and sort of how we see that progressing. We feel very good about the opportunity to gain share as we go through the year, particularly given how competitive the products set is. Similarly, on the PC side, we\\'ve made nice progress over the last 4, 5 quarters. On Ryzen, we started strong on desktop, and then the last couple of quarters, we\\'ve made good progress on notebook. We see a broader portfolio with our OEMs as we go into 2019, and we also see a more competitive desktop product line as well as notebook product line. So that\\'s how we\\'re thinking about the year. To your point about starting a little bit with lower guidance in Q1, I think that\\'s true. When we look at Q1, particularly on a year-on-year basis, there are a lot of moving pieces. But it\\'s primarily due to the graphics channel. And that\\'s both the reduced demand as well as the absence in blockchain revenue on a year-over-year basis as well as the semi-custom business. But as we move forward, as we go into Q2 and beyond, we see a significant opportunity with the ramp of our new products, and that\\'s how we see the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it, that\\'s helpful. Devinder, maybe just a couple of little things in terms of licensing gains and IP revenue, just I got asked a few times, and I just want to clarify here that the gross margin outlook for the first quarter does not include any IP or licensing gains. And then, for the full year, are you including any IP revenue in the revenue outlook, and are we -- how should we think about the rest of the THATIC licensing gains applied to sort of timing for when those might get recognized? I know there\\'s a lot there. But lots of questions on just the moving pieces there tonight.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I can take that. License gain essentially does not impact gross margin. That sits on a separate line altogether on the licensing gain line in the P&L. So the gross margin is not impacted by that. As far as IP revenue is concerned in Q1, there\\'s no contemplated IP revenue, so the gross margin at 41% guide is based on the products that we have. And for the year, at this point, outside of the THATIC JV IP licensing gain that we are expecting or recording in Q1, while there might be opportunities from an IP standpoint, but nothing substantial contemplated at this point.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I\\'m curious as you look back at 2019 and the success you had with EPYC -- the initial success with EPYC. What was the mix of cloud versus enterprise? And then how do you think it trends in 2019 because of all the concerns around slowdown in cloud CapEx and so forth? And as part of that, if you could share with us what your market share assumptions are as we exit the year on EPYC.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, Vivek. As we look through 2018, we were pretty pleased with our progress on EPYC, and coming off of the fourth quarter, actually, it was a fairly strong fourth quarter for us and the fact that we doubled the number of units for our server business. And when you look at that mix, it is more cloud-weighted. So we had some large deployments that went online here in the fourth quarter, and that was positive for us. That being said though, we\\'re making nice progress in the Enterprise and HPC side of the business too. We\\'ve had a number of wins in the quarter as well as going into 2019. So as we look into 2019, I would expect that the early Rome deployments will also be cloud-based. We\\'ll be the first ones, but we have a strong set of enterprise platforms, and as I mentioned earlier, it\\'s the breadth of the OEM platforms that gives us good confidence that we\\'re going to a broader set of workloads and having broader coverage in the market. In terms of share assumptions, we\\'ll have to see how the market and the year play out, but I think what we\\'ve said before is that, after reaching the mid-single digit market share in the fourth quarter 2018, we would expect it would take another 4 to 6 quarters to reach 10% market share. And I think we\\'re still in that range.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And for my follow-up, there were 2 things that came out on your competitors\\' last few public discussions, which is, one, this concept of CPU shortages, and I\\'m wondering if that has had any positive or negative effect on your strategy or positioning. And then Intel has also mentioned being a little more tactical when it comes to pricing, and I\\'m wondering how that figures into your full year outlook? So both the impact of CPU shortages and pricing, any color would be very helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Vivek. So look, on the CPU shortages, my comment is that there are some pockets of shortage, particularly at the low end. However, our focus has really been on ramping Ryzen. And if you look at the Ryzen percentage of our overall business, Ryzen, Devinder mentioned, was 80% of our client business. So we are really actually improving our mix in the client business. I think that, again, from my view, the shortages are temporary. But we look at it as really getting consistent share gain. And as we\\'ve gone through each quarter in 2018, we\\'ve seen consistent share gain, and we believe we gained share in the fourth quarter as well. So I think we\\'re well positioned with the portfolio, and we\\'ll certainly drive that into 2019. And then, the other?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Pricing.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Oh, pricing, yes. Relative to pricing, look, when we think about pricing and when we put together our long-term model, we have factored in that pricing and competition will be aggressive. I think we know that to be the case. What we\\'ve seen in the market is consistent with that, but we also believe that particularly as you go into the data center, the single largest factor from a buying decision standpoint is the performance and the total cost of ownership of the product, and we believe that Rome will be very, very well positioned in 2019. And so we are cognizant of the competitive environment but feel good that we have the right set of assumptions.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great to hit that mid-single digit milestone exiting the year. Lisa, as you start -- I just wanted to confirm, you expect to ship -- start shipping Rome midyear. And as you do, what\\'s the biggest risk for Rome? Is it execution on delivering the product? Or is it the sales the process, convincing customers to take EPYC 2 in volume?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so I think the -- with Rome, our biggest opportunity/risk is adoption rate. I think, from a competitive standpoint, the product is very solid. Everything going through our development labs looks very good as well as our customer engagement. And so this is just about getting customers to production as fast as possible. We do expect though that the adoption rate for Rome will be faster than the adoption rate for Naples. And the reason for that is we are in a socket-compatible infrastructure. And so customers who don\\'t necessarily need the newest features of the platform can actually use the same motherboard and system that they currently have with Naples and drop in Rome. And so I think that will help us accelerate some of the adoption, but right now, it\\'s about helping customers in their environment. We are widely sampling Rome, and there is a lot of work to be done. But we feel good about the trajectory.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And a follow-up, if I may, for Devinder. So inventories, it looks like they were up about $100 million, going into a pretty healthy seasonal quarter that\\'s declining. What should -- how should we read that, Devinder? And was there just some opportunity to get some wafers more cheaply? Or is there -- are you trying to stockpile product in front of launches, or -- and when can we expect the inventory to be a source of cash on the cash flow statement?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Matt (sic) [Mark]. So the inventory growth is primarily driven by our new products and in preparation for our 7-nanometer next-generation product launches later this year, as you just mentioned. We overall expect to manage the inventory in line with revenue but also in support of the new products that will be launching and ramping throughout the year. Lisa mentioned a few of the launches at CES and also in the script, and we prepared to support that from an inventory standpoint. And we\\'ll see how the year progresses and then manage it from there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Mark. Next question please, operator?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Around the Q1 guide, obviously, you mentioned the GPU weakness, but you also mentioned seasonality across the businesses. Is my assumption correct that, that means everything is basically down sequentially, CPUs, GPUs, servers? Can you tell us, is that true? And if so, can you give us an idea of the magnitude, like at least what is down, I guess, most versus least, sequentially, Ryzen versus GPU versus EPYC?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Stacy. So the largest driver, as I\\'ve said, is the GPU channel situation on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, typical seasonality for, let\\'s call it, PCs and GPUs and data center is probably around 10% or so. We are forecasting -- or we believe that that will be a little bit -- down a little bit more than that. And in terms of the ranking, I would say GPUs are down a bit more than the other 2 segments. That\\'s the way we currently see it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And for my follow-up, I had a question just on, general, EESC. So its revenues are flat year-over-year. The server revenues are up a bunch and it\\'s still losing money. And I get it, there\\'s some incremental investments and everything, but I guess, how do we think about the profitability of that segment? How big does EPYC or Rome with the server business need be to get before it\\'s sustainably profitable, especially as semi-custom is going to continue to decline, you said, 20% in 2019?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I think the key, Stacy, is going to be ramping the server business in 2019. You are right that year-over-year we look at it, it\\'s lost little bit of money. But fundamentally, it\\'s investing in the go-to-market programs and launching the new products, investing in the ongoing engineering work that\\'s needed to make sure the customers bring out the product on time. And semi-custom, given the fact that it\\'s in the seventh year of the cycle, we expect it to be down from 2018 to 2019. But we do expect to go ahead and ramp our server business, and that will definitely benefit the EESC profitability in 2019.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Do you think it\\'s profitable for the full year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Too early to tell. I won\\'t -- I don\\'t want to predict profitability at the segment level, but we\\'ll see how it evolves over the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, a potentially different way to ask the same question on the full year 2019 guide. Late last year, at a few different events, you talked about the server business being second-half-weighted. If I go through the remainder of this year, it seems like you have to grow the better part of 20% plus sequentially in each quarter to get there. I know it\\'s not going to be perfectly linear like that. But I guess, my overall question is, if the server side of the business is back-half-weighted, what sorts of businesses are helping the middle portion of the year? Is there some snapback on the GPU side? Is there something going on in the Ryzen side? Just trying to get somewhat of the shape of the year off of a base that\\'s admittedly pretty low as your first quarter starting point.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Ross. So yes, I think it is fair to say that our quarterly progression will have a lot to do with our product launches. So you would expect that server will be more second-half-weighted than the first half. In general, our business is more second-half-weighted, though, if you think about the consumer portions of our business. But think about it as we would expect sequential growth in PCs. We would certainly expect sequential growth in data center, although stronger in the second half. We would -- we\\'re also -- as we see the GPU business right now, we see the first quarter as the low point in the business, with the channels getting -- improving as we go into the second quarter. And we have additional product launches there as well. So that\\'s the way we would see the portfolio. And semi-custom, although it\\'s lower on a year-over-year basis, we would expect it to also increase as we go from second quarter into third quarter as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Perfect. And a question on the GPU side, your big competitor in that market obviously is having some current issues and mentioned that the new product at the high end wasn\\'t selling through. Are you at all concerned that the competitive landscape in that market, whether it\\'s because China demand being weaker, as they cited, or them having to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing would do anything to your ability to penetrate the market with either existing or new GPU products as the year progresses?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so, look, when we look at the GPU market, and let\\'s separate sort of gaming and data center, I think, on the gaming side, from what we are seeing, we did see sellout increase in Q4 versus Q3. So gamers are still buying GPUs. They may be more discerning about price points, and so I can imagine that there might be a bit more softness at the high end versus in the mid-range. But we believe that we have a good understanding of what\\'s happening in the gaming side of the business. And it will be driven -- our gaming growth will be driven by new products. And we would see that as we go through this year with our Radeon VII launch as well as our Navi launches on the gaming side. On the data center side, we\\'re making good progress in GPU data center, obviously from a low base, but the GPUs in the data center are very workload-dependent. There are some workloads that actually we do very well in things like cloud gaming and virtualization, and we have some early HPC wins. And so we see this as sort of customer acquisition redeployment. And so those are the sources of growth on the PC side for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just 2 questions, if I can, building on that last one. In your prepared remarks, you noted that you\\'ve reached the milestone of which GPUs as well as data center CPUs reached a mid-teens percentage of your total revenue. I\\'m curious as you kind of contemplated your full year guidance, where do you think that mix of business can go? And is there a point in time where we actually -- you foresee us kind of getting granularity on how big the data center GPU business is trending?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Aaron. So I think the mid-teens percentage revenue for us in Q4 was -- was a good milestone. I mean, I think that\\'s a meaningful percentage of our revenue. And it was a contributor to our gross margin as we exited 2018. I think, as we go into 2019, again, we will continue to give you visibility into where the data center growth is. To be fair, my expectation is that the CPU side of the data center business will grow faster than the GPU side, just given what we see in terms of overall deployments. But I think both businesses will be meaningful for us and our key part of the growth story for us in 2019, and we\\'ll continue to give color on how they develop as the year develops.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, that\\'s very helpful. And just real quickly on the semi-custom side. As you kind of contemplated the guidance as well through the course this year and that 20% decline for the full year, is your assumption that Q1 kind of marks the bottom and we can grow seasonally off of that level? Or should we think about something differently from a progression through the quarters in \\'19?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Aaron, yes, that\\'s the correct way to think about it. So Q1 will be a low, Q2 will be higher, Q3 will be higher, and then Q4 will come down again. That should be the seasonality of semi-custom.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, notwithstanding that the macro is extremely uncertain, making any predictions difficult. I\\'m just kind of curious, going back to Ross\\' question, how do you see sort of the cadence of growth sequentially throughout the year? Because as he pointed out, if you kind of divided it up equally by quarter, you\\'re growing north of 20% in Q2, Q3, Q4, half-on-half growth, it would be somewhere around 50%. If you assume more seasonal, and seasonal is a little bit difficult to get to because of the change of accounting, I think you can get half-on-half growth as high as 75%. So as you think about the full year growth, is this something that\\'s more like 50% half-on-half or 75% half-on-half?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks for the question, John. It might be a little bit early for us to go there. But what I would say is the following. When we look at the year-on-year compares from 2019 to 2018, Q2 2018 was still a very strong quarter for us because we still had a significant amount of blockchain sales in Q2 2018. So I expect that we will grow sequentially into Q2, but I think that will still be, let\\'s call it, a tougher year-on-year compare. But then when we get into the second half of the year, we expect to be fully ramped on the entire 7-nanometer portfolio. And so we would see a heavier weighting in the second half. So we see sequential growth into second quarter but more heavily weighted into the second half.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s really helpful. And then, Devinder, on the profitability front, if you kind of run the numbers from Q1 guidance to kind of what you need to be exiting Q4 at to hit the full year number, you could see revenue up well over $1 billion, Q1 to Q4. I\\'m a little bit surprised that despite that, the gross margin guidance isn\\'t a little bit better. I know you guided the full year to greater than 41% with Q1 at 41%, but I\\'m kind of curious, if you look at a Q4 run rate that\\'s north of $1 billion higher than the Q1 run rate, how should we think about gross margin and operating margin exiting the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think, John, if you look back the last many quarters, I think 7 quarters year-on-year, we\\'ve improved gross margin on the strength of the newer products. We ended the year quite well in 2018 and achieved gross margin in the fourth quarter that was nice. And now we start the year with 41%, and as we start the year, it\\'s early guiding greater than 41%. I think you should expect that as the products ramp, in particular with the 7-nanometer product that Lisa referenced, our margins will continue to improve, and we\\'ll see where we end up at by the end of the year. But we do expect that, year-on-year, margin goes up from where we ended in 2018 at 39% and greater than 41% for 2019.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have 2, quickly. First, on the C&G side, I realized that there\\'s going to be a lot of kind of sequential difficulties there, but when I think about the long-term growth rate, I know you guys have kind of talked to kind of high singles to double-digit growth. Is that still essentially where you think that business can grow at long term? And then secondly, in terms of the next EPYC 2, is there any reason why it would underperform an Intel 10-nanometer in a testing environment? And if so, why would that be?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let me take the second question, and then maybe, Devinder, you can take the first question. So as it relates to our Rome product, when Rome was originally planned, we had planned that it would be competing against a 10-nanometer product. So that was the -- that was our expectation when we started. I think we\\'ve shown some of the generational performance advantages in terms of double the performance on a socket basis, 4x performance on a floating-point basis. And the other thing I would say is that, with our second-generation Rome, the customer set is now more used to our architecture, and so some of the architectural and software improvements that we\\'ve also spent quite a bit of time on over the last 4 to 6 quarters are coming into play. So I think we feel very good about the competitive positioning of Rome. And the other thing to keep in mind is we are deep in development of our next-generation beyond Rome. So the Zen 3 product portfolio is deep in development as well. So that\\'s -- our goal is to ensure that we have a consistent cadence of very competitive products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, and then as far as your question on the segment growth is concerned, relative to high-single-digits growth on a company level, in both of the segments, there are some factors that come into play. In Computing and Graphics, obviously, we feel good about the data center side of GPU. But on a compare basis, when you look at 2018 to 2019, we do have the impact of the blockchain and some memory sales from 2018 that don\\'t happen in 2019 from a standpoint of where the market is. And then on the EESC side, semi-custom being down obviously is a factor when you compare year-on-year per segment. But good growth on the data center piece of it, in particular, but with the 7-nanometer Rome product launching in the back half -- I mean, ramping in the back half of 2019. And that\\'s the way you kind of look at it. It is still early in the year from an overall standpoint. And where we ended up in 2018, we\\'re projecting high single-digit growth at the company level for 2019 over 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I just want to ask here, you laid it out a little bit, but in terms of EPYC 2, same socket, but -- and you have sampled it early. But in terms of getting over the finish line and getting these shipped, I guess, the customer still has to wait for production silicon. And then -- and typically, people talk about 6 to 12 months so they can kind of test it and make sure it does everything with the production silicon. So can you just walk us through the timeline because, obviously, you\\'re baking in a pretty steep ramp in the second half?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so we started sampling EPYC actually last year, so the second half of last year, to some of the top cloud vendors as well as our OEM partners. We\\'ve had a significant amount of development with our ODM partners as well. So I think there is a good amount of overlap between the customer development cycle and our development cycle. Now as you said, production silicon is very key, and ensuring that the final specifications are locked in is work that we still have to do here in the first half of this year. But I think we feel good about it. We feel good about the platforms, the customer engagements, the current progress of development and so that is very much our plan from an execution standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I just want to ask on the GPU side. It looks like your ASP was up substantially with the data center. I was just kind of curious, as you think about the mix of data center, do you think -- how do you think about the trajectory of that business? I mean, is it -- is that portion lumpy as well? Or is this kind of the go-forward kind of level after that pretty sharp initial shipment in December?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so on the data center side, we do expect that the data center GPU business will be a growth driver for us in 2019. It will be a little bit lumpy so I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s a straight line. But I would say, on a year-over-year basis, it\\'s a important growth driver for us. And as it relates to the overall data center GPU ASPs affecting overall ASPs, I think that\\'s true because the gaming ASPs are -- I\\'m sorry, the gaming business was lower than expected given the channel inventory situation. So I think it\\'s also just weighted in terms of the units.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Blayne. Operator, we have time for 2 more questions, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It seems like the GPU data center business is doing pretty well. Can you give us some color, if you look at mid-teens exposure overall between the 2 data center businesses, CPU and GPU, can you give us some qualitative sense for how much of that is GPU at this point and what are the main applications? Is it mostly virtualization? What other applications are you seeing there?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Joe. So for the mid-teens percentage of revenue in Q4, between CPU and GPU, it\\'s actually roughly similar. And then in terms of the workloads, the GPU data center side, we do very well in cloud gaming, we do very well with our virtualization solutions, and we have some early traction in HPC.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. That\\'s helpful. And I guess, just in terms of the business segmentation, I think you alluded to this earlier, but it seems like the conversation typically is around microprocessor, graphics and semi-custom as sort of 3 different opportunities. Have you thought about moving the segmentation to more align with that? And I realize that\\'s easy to talk about and hard to implement, but what\\'s your thought in terms of, over time, sort of migrating that more in line with the way you guys talk about the business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so we look at the business in all different cuts. As you can imagine, we look at it by segment, our CG and EESC. CG is very much a PC-driven segment and EESC with enterprise and semi-custom. And we are also, based on some of the feedback, trying to be a little bit more granular in terms of how the various businesses fall underneath that. So I think as the data center business becomes a larger piece of our business, we\\'ll continue to look for how do we get -- give you guys more color and more transparency in how that is doing.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just in terms of the GPU gaming side, you mentioned higher inventory levels. I was wondering if you can give us some number on where normal inventory GPU levels are and where are they running currently.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so when we look at the GPU channel inventory, we do believe our channel partners reduced inventory in Q4, and they will reduce inventories in Q1. We still think that Q1 levels are elevated, and there will be some spillover into Q2 where we will see some elevated inventory levels. We\\'ll have to see how the sell-through really plays out. But my expectation is that, in Q2, we\\'ll have sort of improved channel inventory levels and we will return to a sequential growth in the gaming side of our business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And on the 7-nanometer side, is the 7-nanometer GPU and CPU, as those ramp in the back half, are they accretive to this 41% gross margin levels?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so the 7-nanometer GPUs on the data center side started ramping in Q4 so that was part of the data center GPU revenue that we talked about. The 7-nanometer CPU will ramp middle of the year, and the 7-nanometer CPU and GPU are both above corporate average margins so you would expect that they\\'re above the 41 points and would be sort of accretive to margin as that mix improves.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We\\'ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\\'d like to turn the floor back to over to management for any further or closing comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you very much, operator.

Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We had a solid first quarter. Revenue was in line with our expectations at $1.27 billion, down 23% year-over-year. Ryzen and EPYC Processor and Data Center GPU revenue more than doubled year-over-year, helping expand gross margin by 5 percentage points and partially offsetting graphics channel softness and lower Semi-Custom revenue. \\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue declined year-over-year as higher Client Processor sales were offset by lower Graphics sales to the channel. Client Processor sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from the year ago period as unit shipments increased significantly and our new products drove a higher client ASP. As a result, we believe we gained unit market share for the sixth straight quarter. \\\\nIn the desktop channel, demand for our highest end Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs was strong, with sales increasing sequentially and outperforming seasonality. Ryzen Mobile Processor adoption continues to accelerate. Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other OEMs have launched more than a dozen new Ryzen mobile notebooks so far in 2019, helping us deliver our fifth straight quarter of year-over-year Mobile Processor growth. Our customers are on track to increase the number of Ryzen Notebook models by more than 50% from 2018. The majority of these new systems are planned to launch in the second quarter in advance of the seasonally stronger second half of the year. \\\\nIn Graphics, revenue decreased year-over-year driven largely by lower channel sales partially offset by a significant increase in Data Center GPU sales. Radeon Vega GPU shipments grew by a strong double-digit percentage both year-over-year and sequentially based on increased adoption across OEM, gaming and data center customers. Apple introduced 2 new iMac systems featuring upgraded Radeon Pro Vega GPUs that deliver up to 80% faster graphics performance than the previous generation. We believe we made good progress improving channel inventory levels. Sell-through accelerated sequentially driven by sales of both our mainstream Radeon RX GPUs and new high-end Radeon VII gaming GPUs. We are well-positioned to grow GPU revenue in the second quarter and through the second half of the year as we expect to introduce our first 7-nanometer Navi gaming GPUs in the third quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong data center GPU sales based on increased adoption across large customers. Our progress was highlighted by Google\\'s announcement that they selected high-performance Radeon GPUs and AMD\\'s software development tools to power their upcoming Stadia game streaming platform. Stadia is a great example of how we are expanding the depth and breadth of our data center customer engagements. We are seeing growing customer interest in our differentiated platforms for game streaming, machine learning and HPC workloads that combine our high-performance GPUs with open source software tools. \\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-custom segment. Revenue decreased from a year ago as expected due to lower Semi-Custom revenue as we enter the seventh year of the current game console cycle. Our Semi-Custom business model continues to play an important role in our long-term growth as our strong IP portfolio enables the industry\\'s biggest brands to create differentiated solutions. The latest example is Sony. We are honored that Sony has selected a custom AMD SoC based on our Zen 2 CPU and Navi GPU architectures to power its next-generation PlayStation console. Our Server CPU revenue grew significantly from the year ago period, as EPYC processor adoption across cloud, HPC and Enterprise customers continued to grow. Overall in the data center, our CPU and GPU sales accounted for a mid-teens percentage of quarterly revenue. Our work with cloud leader, Amazon, continues to expand as they rolled out AMD-based offerings to additional regions and launched 3 new EPYC processor-powered EC2 instance families, including the first T3 Series instance. Growing HPC and regional cloud service provider deployments resulted in EPYC processor channel sales increasing sequentially. In the Enterprise, we added dozens of new customers across the aerospace, health care, automotive and telecom industries based on the superior performance of EPYC processors in big data and general-purpose virtualized workloads. \\\\nTurning to our next-generation Rome processor. We made excellent progress in the quarter, achieving key production milestones with our largest OEM and cloud customers. We are very excited about the performance of Rome, which is on track to deliver 4x the floating-point performance and double the compute performance per socket compared to our current generation EPYC processors. We are on track to begin Rome production shipments in the second quarter to support a third quarter launch. \\\\nIn summary, I am pleased with our first quarter financial results based on the strong execution engine we have built across the company. \\\\nTomorrow is an important day in AMD\\'s history, as we celebrate our 50th anniversary. This is a significant milestone for any company, but especially significant for a technology company. 2019 is arguably the most important year in our history as the $75 billion market for our high-performance Computing and Graphics products has never been larger. And our product portfolio has never been stronger. We are right where we planned to be with our multiyear road map, including our upcoming 7-nanometer Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processors that can drive our next wave of revenue growth and share gains. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering on our ambitious leadership road map for the PC, gaming and data center markets. \\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder, to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2019 was a good start to the new year. Revenue was $1.27 billion and gross margin of 41% was up almost 5 points from the prior year. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion driven by the ramp of our strong portfolio of high-performance products. Quarterly revenue was down 23% from a year ago. Strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and data center GPUs were more than offset by lower graphics channel sales and lower Semi-Custom revenue. Gross margin was 41%, up 470 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by Ryzen, EPYC -- Ryzen and EPYC processor sales as well as data center GPU sales. Operating expenses grew 12% year-over-year to $498 million, primarily driven by go-to-market activities and investments in our product road map. Operating income was $84 million, down from $152 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a $60 million licensing gain from the joint venture with THATIC. Operating margin was 7%, down from 9% last year. Net income was $62 million, compared to $121 million a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.06 per share compared to $0.11 per share a year ago. \\\\nNow turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $831 million, down 26% year-over-year, as strong Client Processor and Data Center GPU sales were more than offset by lower Graphics channel sales. Ryzen Products continued to ramp driven by strong growth across both desktop and mobile processors. \\\\nIn Graphics, sales were down year-over-year due to lower Graphics channel sales and negligible blockchain-related revenue in the quarter, partially offset by strong Radeon Data Center GPU sales. \\\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating income was $16 million compared to $138 million a year ago. The decrease was due primarily to lower revenue and higher OpEx. \\\\nIn the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue was $441 million, down 17% from the prior year. Server revenue growth was more than offset by anticipated lower Semi-Custom revenue. EESC segment operating profit was $68 million compared to $14 million a year ago. The improvement was largely due to an IP licensing gain of $60 million associated with the joint venture with THATIC. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we received $448 million of cash related to Mubadala\\'s warrant exercise. We used $64 million of cash to fully extinguish the 2019 term debt and $100 million of cash to retire other term debt. The principal debt balance as of the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion as compared to $1.7 billion a year ago, and we have no long-term debt maturities until 2022. Free cash flow was negative $275 million in the quarter primarily due to higher inventory and the timing of collections. We expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year. Inventory was $955 million, up $110 million sequentially, primarily due to an increase in inventory of new products in anticipation of higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $130 million compared to $196 million a year ago due to lower quarterly earnings and, on a trailing 12 month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $737 million. Gross leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.8x. \\\\nTurning to the outlook for the second quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.52 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 19% sequentially and a decrease of approximately 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase is expected to be driven by growth across all businesses. The year-over-year decrease is expected to be primarily driven by lower Graphics channel space -- sales, negligible blockchain-related GPU revenue and lower Semi-Custom revenue. In addition, for Q2 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $510 million, as we invest in our new products and upcoming product launches, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $25 million. \\\\nFor the full year 2019, AMD continues to expect high single-digit percentage revenue growth and non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 41%. \\\\nIn closing, the first quarter was a good start to the year. We remain focused on executing our plans for the remainder of the year and look forward to unveiling a strong portfolio of next-generation products to drive financial growth and customer momentum throughout 2019. \\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready for our first conference -- for our first call?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations, Lisa, to you and your team on the 50th anniversary. I guess, the first question from me is, it was encouraging to see you guys reiterate the full year growth expectation. Obviously, one of your large server competitors had a bit of a hiccup on some of the outlook and talked about maybe a bit of a softer server market for the full year. Maybe you could give an update on what you guys are seeing for the servo macro environment and the confidence that you might have in the product\\'s ramping?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Matt. Thank you for the question. So yes, as it relates to how the year is developing, it\\'s developing largely as we expected when we started the year. So relative to our Q2 guidance, we are guiding up 19% sequentially and every business is growing. That\\'s coming from, if you look across the businesses, our client business is growing due to new platforms that are launching. Our Graphics business, the channel inventory has improved since we started the year, and we have our Server business which is really starting some early shipments of Rome in the second quarter going to the second half of the year. As it relates to the full year guidance and how we look at it, again, it\\'s largely as we expected as we\\'re laying out the year. There certainly is some discussion with our customers about some inventory in the Data Center especially here in the first half. When we developed them, our plan, our Data Center business was always more second half weighted, and continues to be so, because much of that is dependent on platforms that are launching around our Rome product portfolio. So we\\'re going to continue to watch the Data Center overall environment, but at this point, we\\'re focused on our products and our customers continue to have a very strong pull. There\\'s a lot of interest in Rome. We\\'re doing well on our qualifications and so we feel good about how that\\'s developing.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And as a follow-up, you mentioned the 19% sequential guidance for Q2. It seems like a bit of a transitional quarter for the company with a lot of things going on towards product launches that will happen to feed the back half of the year. So maybe you could talk a little bit more granularly about the drivers of Q2, just given that it\\'s a bit of a transition for a whole new portfolio rolling out, and if there\\'s any kind of color on contributions from older or newer products in the second quarter guidance, that would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Matt. So, yes. As we look at Q2, it is a bit of a transition in the product portfolio. It\\'s an important quarter for us as we are preparing to launch our 7-nanometer products. In terms of the overall business, as I stated earlier, each of the businesses is growing for different reasons. I think starting with Server, again, it\\'s the greatest percentage of growth, and it really is the start of some shipments of Rome. We expect that Rome will launch here in the third quarter and there\\'s some preparations that need to be done for that. As we look at the Graphics business, again, the channel inventory situation has improved and so that we expect that the channel will be up here in the second quarter and then into the second half as we launch Navi. And in the Client business, we have a large number of platforms with our OEM customers that are launching here in the second quarter around our second-generation Ryzen mobile processors, and we\\'re also in preparations for our third-generation Ryzen desktop as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess, first question, and I do have a quick follow-up, is when you kind of lay out Rome and the expectation of a ramp going forward, can you just remind us of how you currently see the setup with regard to market share opportunities or market share gains that you would expect? And where do you think you fell off this last quarter in terms of market share in the overall server space?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Aaron. Look, as we look at the server market, we know very well that the data center market takes time to ramp with any new product. And so that\\'s the way we have sort of built our plans. What we have previously stated is that, from, let\\'s call it, at the beginning of this year, we\\'d expect that over the next 4 to 6 quarters, we would continue to ramp our server market share with a goal of getting to double-digit percentage share. As it relates to the Q1 quarter, again, we\\'ll have to wait to see how the numbers come out. The Data Center business, for us, on the CPU side behaved as expected in Q1. But we did see some product mix shift, so Q4 was a large quarter for us in the Cloud business for our EPYC processors. And Q1, the mix shift did more to Enterprise and channel. And from that, the ASPs were higher, the units were lower and so again, largely as we would\\'ve expected.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, congratulations on the announcement with Sony. I\\'m just curious, I think last quarter, you had suggested that you expected that Semi-Custom business to decline by 20%-plus this year. Assuming that, that\\'s still the case, number 1. Number 2, how do we now start to think about the growth profile of that looking into next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Sure. So yes, we are very pleased with our partnership and expanding our partnership with Sony on their next-generation consoles. As we see the Semi-Custom business at this point, we still believe that it\\'s going to be down substantially in 2019. Let\\'s call it approximately 20% plus. And then as we go into 2020, without talking about any specific customer, we believe that Semi-Custom will return to a growth business for us in 2020 and beyond.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, we continue to hear about the CPU shortage, which is obviously primarily caused by your competitor. I\\'m curious, are you seeing any impact on your business in the near term? And more importantly, as we go into the second half and they ramp capacity, are you concerned at all that, that could disrupt your business, whether it be market share swings or pricing pressure? And I have a follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So as it relates to CPU shortages in the market, look, we see a little bit of that. I would say there are pockets of shortage, mostly at the low-end of the market, frankly. So from our standpoint, I don\\'t believe it\\'s a huge contributor to our business. As we look at the PC business, both in the first half and the second half of the year, we believe that the PC business can be a growth business for us. From a market environment standpoint, we believe the market is not too bad. We call it flat to slightly down. When we look at our product portfolio in the notebook space with our second-generation Ryzen platforms, I would believe we have much stronger platforms that are ramping through this year. And then in the desktop space, we believe we\\'ll be very competitive as we\\'ve launched the third generation of Ryzen desktops. So I view the PC business as an important growth driver for us in 2019 and we see it as a good market for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then on the follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that Data Center CPUs and GPUs accounted for about mid-teens percentage of your revenue in the quarter. Like last quarter, can you give us a rough split between the 2 and related to that, I was hoping you could help us size the game streaming opportunity long-term. Obviously, you\\'re involved with Google today. How does that business with them evolve over the next 12 to 18 months? And what\\'s your opportunity elsewhere in terms of broadening your customer base?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So, as we stated, that the Data Center CPU and GPU business was about mid-teens percentage of revenue for us. Both businesses were down, as expected, in Q1 and much of that was the strength of the Q4 quarter, especially around the cloud. We mentioned in Q4 that the split between CPUs and GPUs was close. So they were close. As we look longer term for Data Center GPUs, and your question about the cloud streaming opportunity, we\\'re very pleased with our partnership with Google. It\\'s a result of several years of effort, where we were optimizing both hardware and software together. And so we think it\\'s an important vertical for us. We are working with other customers in the cloud streaming area as well. So again, I think it\\'s an interesting and important market over the next couple of years. We also have a number of other workloads that we feel good about as it relates to data center GPU, including HPC, especially when you combine our CPU and GPU portfolio together. We think HPC is a great workload for us and -- as well as machine learning. And we\\'re working with, in machine learning, with a couple of leading cloud customers to, again, optimize our software to their needs. So again, the data center GPU market will continue to be an important driver for us over the next couple of years.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have a question on your gross margin guidance. I\\'m a little confused why it\\'s flat sequentially into Q2 on a pretty meaningful revenue lift. You talked about all business is growing and you mentioned a number of them, but you didn\\'t mention Semi-Custom. I mean, is this just a matter of mix? Is Semi-Custom driving a lot of the growth or is there something else going around -- on about your intra-business mix or pricing or something? Like what\\'s going on with the gross margins?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Stacy, let me start and I\\'ll let Devinder comment. I should have mention Semi-Custom in that list as well. So Semi-Custom is going through a seasonal build. So although it will be down substantially year-over-year, it\\'s still a seasonal build for us as we go from Q2 -- from Q1 into Q2. Devinder, maybe you want to comment as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          By the quarter, maybe? Like with the growth by business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Can I rank order the growth by business? That\\'s probably a bit more granular than I would like to get, but I think it\\'s fair to say that all businesses have to grow a decent amount to get to 19% sequential growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s right, Lisa. So fundamentally, Stacy, it\\'s the product mix in the quarter that\\'s driving the flat gross margin. Add the 41% guide. It is an improvement of 4 points year-on-year. Now, as you know very well, we have businesses that are higher than corporate average gross margin and lower than corporate average and the mix of the businesses, with Semi-Custom that we just talked about lower than corporate average, is driving the 41% guide for Q2.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You would also -- I\\'m sorry, Stacy, I would just add. You would also expect Graphics is also a bit lower than corporate average on the consumer side.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, so it\\'s fair to say that a good amount of the growth is coming from Graphics and Semi-Custom as it is as well with the other stuff?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, it\\'s really across all of the businesses.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          For my follow-up I had a question on OpEx. You\\'re guiding 29% for the year-on-year, $510 million in Q2, and obviously, high single-digits for the full revenue. So if I had revenue of 8% for the full year, that would imply OpEx in Q3 and Q4 of $510 million of flat to Q2 levels. Do you think that\\'s realistic? Does OpEx actually stay flat for the rest of the year from Q2 levels? Or does it need to go higher and if it goes higher, does that imply that the revenue growth embedded in your guidance for the year has to be about 8%?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I think, Stacy, the way you want to look at it is the first half of 2019, we do have incremental R&D and go-to-market activities in the first quarter and even in the second. As you know, we are preparing for a strong series of significant 7-nanometer product launches this year and also share gains as we get to the back half of the year. And that\\'s obviously driving the OpEx. Overall for the year, we are comfortable in the 29% for the year of overall revenue from an OpEx standpoint. And as you have seen us in the past, we do have a way of modulating the OpEx as needed, but right now, we are investing in the road maps, we\\'re embarking on product launches and the go-to-market activities and very focused to make sure that we are well positioned in the first half going into the second half where we see the revenue lift compared to the first half of 2019.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Does that apply OpEx -- do see OpEx going up from current levels for the rest of the year then? Or does it go down or does it stay flat?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          $510 million is the guide for Q2, and 29% for the year is the layout all through the model.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from David Wong from Nomura Instinet.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Devinder, can you give us an idea of what gross margins are currently running at for the client to data center processors and what direction these gross margins are moving in?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The client and data center businesses are higher than corporate average and the Semi-Custom business and Graphics, as we just said on the last question, are lower than corporate average especially on the Graphics Consumer side and the Data Center GPU side obviously is better.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And are gross margins rising for your Microprocessor businesses at the moment?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think early in the year in the second quarter, we are getting the second quarter [at our] 41% guide and our guidance for the year is greater than 41% on an annual basis, is what we have stated so far.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. And Lisa, my last question, in 2020, do you expect meaningful Semi-Custom revenues outside the game console space and if so, what types of applications will these Semi-Custom chips be used in?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, David, so as it relates to the Semi-Custom business, as we go out in time, we do expect additional applications other than consoles, but consoles are a large piece of the business, and so you would expect that they would continue to be a large piece of the business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just 1 quick historic one. I\\'ve got 2, but the first on the historical side, for March of \\'18, did you guys provide a rough breakout of how much your revenue was server-related?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No. We wouldn\\'t have done that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, we haven\\'t done that. Not that specific. I think server is, if you\\'re referring to the CPU side, it\\'s within the EESC segment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then if I look at the second half of the year, you guys are trying to talk to like around 41%, 42% kind of gross margin rough level. So is it safe to assume that we should see a pretty big step function in September quarter on the gross margin? Or is that, I guess, is that incorrect or is that aggressive?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think you\\'ve got to look at it from a viewpoint of the product mix. I said we are shipping, like Lisa said, Rome in preparation of our launch in Q3. We have a couple of other new products that will start shipping in Q3 and we\\'ll see how the margin comes out when we come in and talk about Q3 about 90 days from now.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m wondering if you can talk about gross margins in the Console segment. Obviously, that\\'s been pretty low historically. You also have customers funding the R&D but as you look to the next generation of consoles, do you see opportunity to improve the gross margin in that space?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Joe. I think it\\'s a bit early to talk about margins for the next generation. As you stated, the gross margins of the Console business are below corporate average. The operating margins are quite good because the customers are paying the engineering expenses for it. But I think the gross margins are below corporate average. We would expect, though, and I think you would expect this, as the company continues to grow, the percentage of the company that is Semi-Custom is lower than it has historically been.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, that makes sense. And then if you look at the GPU Data Center opportunities, the gross margin there, how does that compare to, say, the discrete Graphics portion of your business and how does it compare to corporate average, things like that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The GPU Data Center business would be above corporate average and above our Consumer Graphics business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had a couple of questions on the Server strategy longer term. Can help us understand ultimately what percentage of the workloads in the cloud do you expect to target? And -- that\\'s the first part of the question. The second part of the question is, I was hoping you could provide some color on the customization strategy? I think Intel might argue that they are embedding IP blocks for their customers. Is that something that you do or you think about doing? Or to what extent does your customization strategy fall under your Semi-Custom model? And I was wondering are your customers on the server side asking you for like an APU-kind-of-a product where the -- you have microprocessor and graphics processor capabilities integrated together.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Mark. So look, when we think about our Server strategy and maybe our -- let me generalize it to our Data Center strategy overall. It is a multiyear, multigenerational road map. In terms of the workloads that we plan to address, we are -- in addition to the workloads that we do very, very well on, like, big data, data analytics and virtualization, high-performance computing, cloud workloads, I think we do quite well with general-purpose workloads too, as we move generations. So as we look at, for example, the Rome generation, the second generation of EPYC, we would expect address well 80%-plus of the workloads. As it relates to customization for server CPUs, there are varying degrees of customization that customers want, especially as you go through a number of the different cloud workloads that are out there. There are specific requirements that are there. We\\'re very comfortable doing that. I think the customers have been deeply engaged with us since the first generation of EPYC. There is both software customization as well as some hardware customization that we go through. So -- and we feel very comfortable with our ability to address that across the Cloud and the Enterprise businesses. And then, as we go forward, I think we are also very excited about what we can do when we put our CPU and GPU portfolio together and really do system-level optimization for the Data Center. So we view that as a early opportunity for us but one where there is a lot of opportunity to help customers really optimize for very high-performance computing applications.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the strong results and the pipeline. These are 2 questions from me as well. First, you have Naples now and Rome server shipping soon. Intel has Cascade Lake with Optane. What are you hearing from customers on the pricing versus feature comparison? And where I\\'m going with that is, how well is AMD prepared if your competitor decides to perhaps become a little more aggressive on the pricing side? At what point does pricing matter, and at what point does your feature list matter more?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so Vivek, look, we understand that it\\'s a very competitive market out there. It\\'s always been very competitive and we are prepared for it to get even more competitive. When you look at our road map, I think we feel very comfortable with sort of our positioning. And the way I think about it, when it comes to the data center market, the price is only 1 factor and it\\'s probably not the most important factor when people are choosing their next-generation products. The most important factor is really total cost of ownership, and the advantages that we have with our chiplet architecture and their 7-nanometer sort of process capabilities really have a great sort of power performance benefit. So we are -- as you say, we\\'re prepared for a competitive environment, but we also feel that our product, from a performance standpoint and a positioning standpoint will be positioned quite well in the marketplace.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And as a follow up, Lisa, you mentioned your goal of getting to double-digit market shares in Servers over the next 4 to 6 quarters. I assume that will require a greater contribution from Enterprise customers, and that is right. What pushbacks are you seeing from them now? Is it just a matter of time that you increase your Enterprise attraction? In general, what -- do you need to do anything extra to attract Enterprise customers?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. No, it\\'s a great point. We certainly have deep engagements with both cloud and the OEMs. On the Enterprise customers, we sell through our OEM partners. The pushback that we get, I don\\'t know if I would call it pushback. I would just say that Enterprise tends to move a bit more slowly than cloud. There are longer qualification cycles because there\\'re qualification cycles on both the OEM side as well as the end customer side. We are continuing to build out our direct sales force as it relates to facing the Fortune 1000 customers and CIOs in that area. And I believe we will make progress in Enterprise. Certainly, as we go forward from the Naples generation into Rome, we\\'ll have more platform coverage with our OEMs, and I think there will be more familiarity with our architecture as well as more software optimized to our architecture. So yes, we\\'re very committed to the Enterprise market and expect that we will make progress with time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, was just curious on the Server product, you mentioned Enterprise was the bigger contributor in Q1. Just trying to think about the life cycle of EPYC 1. Enterprise takes longer to call, so I\\'m just kind of curious where you are in terms of rollout of that product. Obviously, Rome\\'s going to come in at the end of the year. I\\'m just kind of curious how you see the tail on EPYC 1 throughout the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so Blayne, I think, as I stated a little earlier, I think the Data Center business does tend to move slowly. So we would expect that there will be a good amount of time where we will have both Naples and Rome in market at the same point in time, and that just depends on qualification cycles, platform needs and some platforms are being refreshed right away. Some platforms are going to take a little bit longer to be refreshed. And so, from my standpoint, I think that Naples will continue to be important for us in 2019, even as we ramp Rome with our launch in the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got you. And then if I could just ask on the Data Center GPU product you had, the Google ramp, I think it started in Q4. Just kind of curious, your pipeline for that product and how you think about the slope of that business and the lumpiness of -- given that large customer?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so we do expect the Data Center GPU business to be a bit lumpy. We do have several sort of large customers that are ramping product with us, and there\\'ll be some ebb and flow as we go on a quarterly basis. But on an annual basis, I think 2019 will certainly be -- we expect it to be significantly up from 2018. And the pipeline is good. So when we look at the pipeline, as I mentioned, cloud streaming is a good workload for us. Google is one customer, but we\\'re working with other customers as well, and we also see HPC and machine learning as additional workloads that will be good for us in that business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Operator, we have time for 2 more questions, please?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Certainly. Our question is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, regarding Navi, if you can comment on it. What is the positioning of that particular product relative to the -- your current 7-nanometer GPU? And regarding Navi, can you tell us if it\\'s going to include ray tracing?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so Hans, we are excited about Navi. Navi is a new architecture for us in gaming. It has a lot of new features across the Navi architecture. Things are progressing well. We expect it to launch in the third quarter. From a positioning standpoint, I probably won\\'t go through it in great detail right now other than to say that it is 7-nanometer Navi, but it will be positioned below where, for example, our Radeon VII is positioned today from a price point standpoint. And then in terms of ray tracing, again, we will talk more about our overall Navi road map as we get closer to the launch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question today is coming from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Edward Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations. As you\\'re introducing the new generations of Ryzen, should we assume that ASPs will continue to go up or are some of these purpose built for lower price points?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Kevin. So as we look at the new generations of Ryzen, our goal is certainly to improve the mix of the products, and so we think, as we improve the performance of the product, that we can improve that mix. Now the actual mix will vary, of course, depending on a number of things as we go through quarter by quarter, but certainly, as -- our goal is to continue to improve our penetration at the higher end of the PC processors.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Kevin.

Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura. And good afternoon to all of those listening in today. We started 2018 with excellent financial results as we delivered our third straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. First quarter revenue of $1.65 billion grew 40% year-over-year. Gross margin improved 4 percentage points, and earnings per share increased significantly based on very strong operating and net income growth. \\\\nOur strong first quarter financial results demonstrate that our long-term strategy is paying off. We are executing consistently on our product roadmap. Our customers are increasingly adopting our new products, and we are strengthening the foundation of AMD with the right long-term investments.\\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment in the quarter. Excellent momentum for our premium product portfolio drove double-digit year-over-year and sequential revenue growth. Client processor sales were significantly better than seasonality, as Ryzen processor shipments grew year-over-year and sequentially. Ryzen processors accounted for 60% of our overall client processor revenue, up from the low 40%s in Q4, with desktop and notebook client processor ASPs increasing. Product execution was strong in the quarter as we expanded our Ryzen processor portfolio with new high-performance products. We launched the first AMD Ryzen desktop APUs, combining the power of our Zen CPU and Vega GPU on a single chip, delivering the world\\'s most powerful graphics on a desktop processor, with the Ryzen desktop 2400G. Initial sales were strong in the component channel, which contributed of the significant Ryzen processor sales increase in the quarter. Additionally, we began shipments of our second-generation Ryzen desktop CPUs based on our 12-nanometer Zen Plus architecture, delivering outstanding gaming performance and best-in-class multiprocessing leadership for gamers, creators and hardware enthusiasts. Ryzen mobile unit shipments also ramped in the quarter ahead of OEM system launches planned for Q2, driving double-digit increases in our mobile processor unit shipments, both year-over-year and sequentially. Initial Acer, HP and Lenovo platforms had strong sales in the quarter, and Dell released new notebooks and 2-in-1s in early April that further expanded our Ryzen portfolio. Additionally, our first Ryzen PRO commercial notebooks are expected to launch in Q2. Dell, HP and Lenovo are all planning to offer AMD-based commercial notebooks based on the excellent performance and features of this new APU. \\\\nOverall, the number of Ryzen-based systems from OEMs continues to grow. In Q2 alone, we expect 25 new Ryzen-based consumer and commercial notebooks to launch, and our customers remain on track to bring a total of 60 Ryzen-based systems to market by the end of the year. \\\\nIn Graphics, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth as ASP and unit shipments increased significantly. On a sequential basis, revenue increased and we outperformed seasonality with strong Radeon Vega and 500 series channel sales, driven by both gaming and blockchain demand. Gaming continues to be a top priority for us, with growth being driven by the expanding number of PC gamers and increasing demand for graphics performance to deliver more immersive experiences. Demand for our Radeon series of graphics products remained strong as new AAA game titles, such as Far Cry 5, were released. We continued our investments in gaming software and released our Radeon e-sports experience, providing a performance uplift on popular e-sports games such as Fortnite, PUBG, Dota 2 and Overwatch. We continue to see a significant demand for our Radeon Vega graphics family, as customers accelerate their RAMs based on increasing availability of our high-performing GPUs, with more supply coming to market. \\\\nIn professional graphics, HP and Dell both expanded their AMD Radeon Pro workstation portfolio offerings in the quarter, including HP\\'s launch of new Zbook thin and light mobile workstations powered by the AMD Radeon Pro WX 3100. \\\\nOur machine learning strategy continues to gain momentum. Mega data center partners are validating and testing our Radeon Instinct MI25 for deep learning applications, and we introduced our Radeon Open Compute ecosystem, ROCm 1.7, a top-to-bottom open solution software stack for machine learning. I\\'m also happy to report that our next-generation 7-nanometer Radeon Instinct product, optimized for machine learning workloads, is running in our labs, and we remain on track to provide samples to customers later this year. \\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Q1 revenue decreased year-over-year, due to lower semi-custom revenue, as expected, based on a maturity of the current game console cycle, and increased sequentially. In the quarter, Microsoft announced support for our industry-leading Radeon FreeSync technology in their Xbox One S and Xbox One X consoles, delivering stutter free gaming experiences. Server revenue increased double-digit percentage sequentially across mega data center, OEM and channel customers. EPYC processor unit shipments nearly doubled from the previous quarter. We continue to grow our data center momentum with dozens of new design wins across key workloads, including HPC, storage, virtualization and cloud applications. Dell EMC launched 3 of their newest PowerEdge platforms, powering virtualized storage area networks, hybrid cloud applications, dense virtualization and big data analytics with EPYC 7,000 series processors. Recently, supercomputing leader, Cray, announced that it added EPYC processors to its Cray CS500 line of HPC offerings. The Cray announcement pops off a very active quarter in HPC and big data, building on workload momentum in automotive simulations, university clusters and health care. And multiple mega data center customers passed key production milestones as they look to expand their deployments of EPYC-powered instances this year. \\\\nTo date, there are more than 40 EPYC-based platforms in market, and we are actively working with OEMs, system integrators and channel partners to increase deployment to end customers. We remain focused on achieving mid-single-digit server unit share by the end of 2018.\\\\nOur Embedded business delivered increased revenue, unit shipments and ASPs, year-over-year and sequentially, as we introduced 2 new product families: the EPYC Embedded 3000 and the Ryzen Embedded V1000 processors, to enable a new class of thin clients, IoT and other Embedded solutions. \\\\nIn closing, we are extremely pleased with our first quarter financial results and strong product execution. We believe 2018 is shaping up to be an excellent year for AMD with continued revenue growth and margin expansion driven by significant demand for our high-performance Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC products. Looking forward, we are confident that we have the right long-term strategy to deliver sustained revenue and profitability growth. The market TAM in high-performance computing will grow to over $75 billion over the next few years, including high-growth segments, like gaming, data center, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We have built a strong execution engine, and we will continue to make significant investments in hardware and software to deliver an even more compelling roadmap for our customers in 2019 and beyond. \\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder, to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was a strong quarter for AMD. Year-over-year, we grew revenue 40%, expended gross margin by more than 400 basis points, significantly improved net income and earnings per share, and achieved GAAP and non-GAAP net profitability. \\\\nTotal revenue of $1.65 billion was driven by strong demand for our new products, with Ryzen and Radeon products growing double-digit percentage year-on-year, Ryzen sales coming in higher-than-expected, and EPYC server processors ramping. \\\\nGross margin was 36%, up 420 basis points year-on-year, driven by a higher proportion of revenue from new products. Operating expenses were $446 million compared to $371 million a year ago. Operating expenses were 27% of revenue, lower than our prior guidance of 28%, and down 4 percentage points from 31% a year ago, as we continue to make strategic R&D investments, launch new products and invest in our multi-generation product roadmaps. \\\\nOperating income was $152 million, up sharply from $34 million a year ago, and operating margin was 9%, up from 3% a year ago. \\\\nNet income was $121 million, or diluted earnings of $0.11 per share as compared to a net income of $2 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million compared to $68 million a year ago and, on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $496 million. \\\\nNow turning to the first quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.12 billion, up 95% year-over-year due to strong sales of both Radeon and Ryzen products. Our Ryzen offerings outperformed our expectations in Q1, accounting for approximately 60% of client processor revenue and contributed to strong sequential double-digit percentage growth in client revenue. The strength in Radeon products was driven by both gaming and blockchain demand. We believe blockchain was approximately 10% of AMD revenue in Q1 2018. \\\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating income was $138 million compared to a loss of $21 million a year ago. This significant turnaround was due to strong revenue growth and improved operating expense leverage. \\\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $532 million, down 12% year-over-year, with lower Semi-Custom revenue partially offset by higher Server and Embedded revenue. As a reminder, revenue in both Q1 2018 and Q1 2017 includes Semi-Custom revenue related to quarter-end inventory, associated with noncancelable purchase orders as required under the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard. EESC operating income was $14 million, down from $55 million a year ago, primarily due to a licensing gain in Q1 2017 as well as increased operating expense investments in our data center business. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.04 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $1.18 billion in Q4, and up from $943 million in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow was negative $132 million in the first quarter. Inventory was $715 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.7 billion. We deployed cash to repurchase $14 million of debt in the first quarter as we continue to reduce term debt and interest expense. \\\\nNow turning to our financial outlook. For the second quarter of 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.725 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This is an increase of 50% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Ryzen, Radeon, EPYC and Semi-Custom revenue. On a sequential basis, we expect Q2 revenue to benefit from continued strength in our Ryzen and EPYC product families and a seasonal increase in Semi-Custom revenue partially offset by a modest decline in graphics due to blockchain. \\\\nAs a reminder, for comparative purposes, Q2 2017 revenue was $1.15 billion under the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard. In addition, for Q2 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 37%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $460 million or 27% of revenue. Non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other, to be approximately $35 million. And inventory to be up slightly on a sequential basis in support of higher revenue. \\\\nOur financial progress in the first quarter is attributable to the ongoing strength of Radeon and Ryzen products as well as continued early contributions from our EPYC products. Our business is strong, and we look forward to continued revenue growth, margin expansion and increased profitability year-over-year. \\\\nBased on the strength of our business momentum for the full year 2018, we now expect revenue to increase by mid-20% over 2017, driven by the ramp of our new products. Blockchain revenue to be mid- to high-single-digit percentage of revenue for 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 37%. \\\\nIn summary, the first quarter was excellent. We are pleased with the momentum within our business execution and strong financial results, which we believe lay the foundation for a strong 2018. We are focused on delivering our long-term target financial model as we execute our monthly generational roadmaps and introduce and ramp high-performance computing products.\\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the Q&A session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you very much. Appreciate that, Devinder. \\\\nOperator, we\\'re ready to go.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the strong results, especially on getting to the double-digit top margins in your Computing and Graphics segment, it\\'s been a while since we saw that. For my first question, Lisa, on EPYC server sales, you mentioned they doubled sequentially. If you could give us some sense of what the magnitude is, so we at least have some ballpark sense on where you are right now? But importantly, what are the remaining pushbacks from customers in terms of what they would like to see before they adopt EPYC in a more meaningful way? Is it just a matter of time? Is it a performance or a pricing gap? Or what else do you need to deliver on to get EPYC to a more meaningful level?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the questions. So look, on EPYC, we did make a very nice progress in the quarter. I think when you look at it from a revenue standpoint, it\\'s a strong double-digit percentage. There is -- we certainly view that the units increasing is also very positive thing. The traction actually is across all areas. So we saw traction in Enterprise sort of end-user deployments. We saw some channel and system integrator deployments as well as hyperscale deployments. And our goal is to get to mid-single-digit share by the end of this year. I think we are making good progress towards that. What we\\'re working with customers now is just going through their various stages of qualifications. So they go from proof of concept to initial deployment then to large volume deployment. And we\\'re in that initial deployment phase. And so I think we\\'re making good progress, and it is -- there are no real pushbacks other than just time going through the classification process and working with them in their environments to make sure that we get fully qualified.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And as a follow-up, if I look at your server ASPs in the past, they were sort of in the $300 to $400 range, well below what your competitor had. As you look a lot of these engagements that you are participating in now, how should we think about pricing trends that you\\'re seeing in that market? Are you able to sell in a higher-value segment than you were able to do in the past?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Vivek, I think the very strong part of our roadmap right now is we\\'re really playing across the entire portfolio. So from, let\\'s call it, the low end of the server market, the entry level, all the way through the high-end 2-piece SKUs. So the pricing on -- that we\\'re seeing in the market is very reasonable. From our standpoint, they are -- we\\'re providing value to the customer, but they\\'re also very accretive to the margins of our own overall business. So yes, the pricing environment is good.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Lisa.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Vivek.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First question on the rise in notebook effort. It sounds like\\'s it\\'s really starting to hit its stride. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color, which segments does it seem to resonate with? To what extent is it a commercial versus a consumer product? And do you think that the Ryzen notebook opportunity, is it bigger than the desktop opportunity ultimately in your minds?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Mark. So look, we -- we\\'re making very good progress on Ryzen. I think we\\'re very pleased with the Q1 results and then what we see going into Q2 in the second half. It is true that up until this quarter, much of our progress has been in the channel and in the desktop portion of the business. We saw a nice increase this quarter in notebooks and what it is, is many of the OEMs are actually launching systems in Q2. And with that, we had -- they\\'re basically building up their production for the second quarter launches. What you\\'re going to see in the second quarter is a number of impressive premium consumer designs, thin and light designs that, I think, are representative of the strength of the product. And we will also see the first launch of the commercial systems from the top OEMs. And the expectation is that the commercial notebooks will kick in, in the second half of the year. Q2 is more of a consumer cycle. But overall, I think we\\'re seeing that the notebook OEM opportunity is a good one. We have strong design wins. The customers are working closely with us. We\\'re doing a lot of work with retailers and the overall go-to-market to ensure that the notebook opportunity is important. And notebook is larger than desktop overall.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. That\\'s helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. On EPYC, the product has been in the market for a while. I understand that you have to go through the testing phase and then pilot programs and initial deployments and then, hopefully, larger scale deployments. What -- how do you think -- or how should we think about the cadence of updates on this product? Is this a similar cadence that you would see on the desktop or a notebook side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Mark. So on the service side, the cadence of deployments does tend to be longer. I think we\\'re well into the cadence, and so I think the EPYC work with the OEMs, you saw the culmination of that with HPE announcing in December, and then Dell announcing in the first quarter. That will now move over into Enterprise customers, who are then taking their systems into their labs and doing their initial deployments. So I think the cadence is over a number of quarters. I will say, for the first-generation EPYC, we\\'re seeing really nice customer interest, and it\\'s quite broad. And so it is across Enterprise as well as the hyperscale customers. And we view this as a multigenerational play, so we\\'re very excited about what EPYC can do over the next couple of quarters. But we also believe that this is the right investment to make with the customer set as we bring out the second generation of EPYC and the third generation of EPYC, obviously, it would go a little bit faster because the customer set is familiar with our system.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Devinder, impressive year-over-year gross margin growth in the March quarter of 400 basis points. I\\'m just kind of curious, clearly, Ryzen has had a positive impact. Can help break down the 400 basis points year-on-year growth between kind of new products and the fact that Semi-Custom sort of declined as a percent of the mix pretty significantly from \\'17 to \\'18? And then how do we think about the incremental margin leverage as EPYC comes in and perhaps Ryzen, too?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, a good question, John. Actually, if you look at it from a margin standpoint year-over-year, the Semi-Custom revenue was actually down, so that was helpful. But beyond that, if you look at the new products, fundamentally, the new products is what\\'s driving the margin. Ryzen, EPYC, GPU compute retail all higher than corporate average, those are driving the increase in the margin. As we get to the rest of the year, as you observed, the momentum and the products are there for the new products. They\\'re going to go ahead and contribute to the margin increase and that\\'s why from prior guidance, we just updated our margin to say maybe greater than 36% the last time, we updated it to say greater than 37% this time for the year, and that\\'s fundamentally all with the momentum that we have for the new products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s helpful, Devinder. And Lisa, for my follow-up. I appreciate kind of quantifying blockchain for both the first quarter and for last year, and also, your commentary about it being -- it looks like down sequentially, at least embedded in your June guidance. I\\'m just kind of curious, just given how hard it is the track where these GPUs are really going, how do you get a sense of what\\'s a blockchain application versus something else, one? And two, do you see this as a viable long-term market, or do you believe that as this market develops, it\\'s going to have to move from proof of work to proof of stake, which might just negate mining altogether and if that scenario were to play out, how worried are you about sort of secondary cards coming back to the market and kind of hurting pricing either the second half of this year or into 2019?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, John. So look, on the blockchain, there is a lot of discussion about this. From our standpoint, we stay very, very close to the customer set with -- in the graphic space. And so we spend time with the commercial miners as well as spending time with our partners. And the way we look at this, our first priority when we look at allocation of graphics cards is to gamers. And so that\\'s through OEMs, that\\'s through system integrators that\\'s also working with key e-tailers to make sure that they are prioritizing the gamers segment, and we\\'re going to continue to do that. And so that\\'s one piece that we know well. We also work directly with the commercial miners. And so we see kind of what their forecasts are and they work with us. And so that\\'s -- that we have good visibility on. There is a piece that go through retail that it\\'s hard to tell whether that\\'s gaming or mining, but we believe we have a good sense of what that is. So it is an approximation, but we think it\\'s a good approximation of where we are. And then to your longer-term question, I do think the blockchain infrastructure is here to stay. I think there are numerous currencies, there are numerous applications that are using the blockchain technology. We don\\'t see a significant risk of GPU -- secondhand GPUs coming into the market. I think what you find is that, one, there are number of different currencies; and two, a lot of these users that are buying GPUs these days are actually buying them for multiple use cases, both commercial and consumer. So they\\'re not necessarily buying just for mining. And I think for that reason, we do think this is a different cycle. That being the case, we do see a bit of volatility in it and that\\'s why we are putting into our forecast for the second quarter and the second half, a little bit lower blockchain demand but that\\'s more than made up for by the other new products and the way the new products are ramping in the business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Operator, next question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Can you give us some idea of what your June guidance assumes in terms of sequential microprocessor sales growth compared to discrete graphics growth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, David. So in our second quarter guidance, we\\'re actually assuming that Ryzen and EPYC are up, and Semi-Custom is also up seasonally, and we expect graphics to be down modestly based on some of the blockchain demand.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Excellent. Can you give us an update on what new products you plan to launch through the rest of this year and next year? And when these are scheduled to come out?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. That\\'s a lot, David, but let me say a couple things. I think relative to our CPU business, and we are launching additional Ryzen-based products in the second half of the year, we just launched the second-generation Ryzen desktop in 12-nanometer. And that launch has gone really well. I mean, we\\'re very happy with the positioning and how customers are reacting to that. In the second half, we\\'ll have some commercial systems and some other updates to our Ryzen lineup that we will launch. We have a 7-nanometer GPU based on Vega that we\\'ll sample later this year. We have a 7-nanometer server, a CPU that we\\'ll sample later this year. And then obviously, we have a number of products that are planned for 2019 as well. So it\\'s a very, very busy product season for us, but we\\'re pleased with the sort of the execution on the product roadmap.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First around OpEx, are you still looking for a 28% of revenue for the full year on a higher revenue base? And given that -- if that\\'s your -- what areas are kind of key for investment then as we get through the rest of the year and going forward?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, let me take that, and then Lisa can add. So yes, we are targeting 28%. As you see, Stacy, we have a long-term target model of 26% to 30%. The year has started out well, we came in at 27% in Q1, and targeting around the same for Q2. But we do -- we are still in investment mode, and obviously, investing in R&D and the product roadmap. And Lisa can maybe add some of the details in terms of where we\\'re investing in terms of OpEx.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, Stacy. So I think from the investment side, certainly we\\'re investing in R&D on the CPU and the GPU side, but a key focus for us is in software, and particularly, machine learning software. I think there\\'s a high demand of people wanting to use our GPUs in the compute space, and so we\\'re increasing our investments in software around machine learning.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. For my follow-up, I had a question on the ASC 606. I know last quarter, you kind of gave some historicals for how that was a headwind versus a tailwind versus what would have been normal seasonality, particularly in Semi-Custom. Is the ASC 606 into Q2, is that a headwind or tailwind on the guide? And how should we think about that as we go through the second half as well versus what we would have seen without the accounting change?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Fundamentally, ASC 606, from a revenue standpoint, what happens is the seasonality and the profile of the Semi-Custom revenue changes. Some of the revenue that we used to get in the second half moved to the first half, so I would say, it\\'s a little bit more balanced between the first half and the second half, as opposed to the peak revenue we used to see in Q3. So that is the primary effect on the profile of the revenue, not necessarily the annual revenue. ASC 606 has started earning a significant impact on our annual revenue, it\\'s more of the profile of the revenue within the quarters. As far as impact is concerned, if you\\'re comparing year-over-year, for example, in Q1 of 2018, Semi-Custom was down because we had more revenue in Q1 of 2017. And then Q2, it is slightly up but very balanced from where we see it from an overall standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So last year in Q2, it was like -- I forget how much, like a $75 million headwind versus what would have been otherwise? Is it a similar amount of headwind this time in Q2? Or is it less? Or is it a tailwind?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wouldn\\'t -- I would say that it was a headwind last year. This year, from an overall standpoint, if I compare year-over-year, it is up slightly from where we were in Q2 of 2018. So if you\\'re comparing Q2 \\'17 to Q2 \\'18, it\\'s a benefit the revenue in Q2 of 2018 in our guide.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had 2. I\\'m curious about your comments just now on blockchain, and I\\'m a little surprised to hear that you think that there would be limited risk that, that product would come back into the market. Can you, again, go over why you think that is? Because you\\'re selling more of a general SKU, right? And then I guess, also, how you handicap the potential for there to be some ASP effect on that too? I know you\\'ve captured some of the rising ASPs in the channel, so how do you handicap that looking out throughout the rest of the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Tim. So look, when you look at -- I think most people are comparing this sort of -- this blockchain time period to the last one, which is a couple of years ago. And I think there are a couple of important differences. I think the first one is that there are multiple currencies and multiple applications that are being used. And what we\\'ve seen is that people who are mining do go from one currency to another depending on what\\'s happening. We\\'re also seeing that many users on both the commercial and consumer side are actually buying GPUs for multiple use cases. And from that standpoint, again, we see that there is good demand for, not just blockchain, but for gaming, for the cloud and for those things as well. And so I think it\\'s a balanced assessment of where we are. I think the breadth of the blockchain applications and also the breadth of the customer base give us that belief. Now as you go forward, there\\'s also a -- when we look at the Graphics business go forward minus blockchain, we actually see a very good environment. We see a good environment for gaming growing, we see a good environment for GPU compute growing. And frankly, on the gaming side, some of those users have not been able to get access to GPUs and so, again, that\\'s -- those are all positives as we go forward. And then you had a second question, Tim?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I did, yes. I think you said the 7-nanometer product is in the lab, and it\\'s going to launch later this year? That\\'s the product at TSMC, correct? And I guess, I\\'m just wondering on that front, do you feel comfortable that you can get capacity from that vendor?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So our foundry strategy is to use both TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES on the first 7-nanometer product. We are using TSMC for that product, and we have a very strong relationship with them. And so we do see a good momentum on it from what we see, and I\\'m not concerned about capacity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just a follow-up on the Semi-Custom business. On the June quarter guide, you mentioned sequential growth in Semi-Custom. But if I look at your ASC 606 reconciliations for last year, it looks like the Semi-Custom business was actually down double-digits percentage point sequentially going from Q1 to Q2? So like-for-like on their 606, why are there different shipment profiles this year, Q1 to Q2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I can explain that. So in Q1 of \\'17, there was a strategic buy of wafers that we did in Q1 \\'17, so it had a bigger impact in Q1 \\'17 and then the effect caught up in Q2. So the impact Q1 to Q2 was significant. This year, it\\'s more balanced. And from that standpoint, when you compare year-over-year, Q1 to Q1, it\\'s down, but Q2 to Q2, it\\'s up. So there was a different profile in Q1 \\'17 just based on the way the wafers were purchased in \\'17 versus the way in \\'18, where it\\'s a little bit more balanced.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Question for Lisa. Embedded solutions contributed to the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in EESC, I think that this is kind of an often overlooked part of the business because Embedded is nice because it gives you guys exposure to kind of a diverse set of their market applications. Can you just help us understand where the team is seeing good demand traction in Embedded? And maybe give us a rough idea on kind of overall revenue contribution to EESC?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Harlan. So Embedded is a nice segment, you\\'re absolutely right. I think it\\'s a margin-accretive segment to us. The end markets that we ship into, there are thin clients, they are places where you need graphics for displays, so there\\'s some Embedded displays that we ship into there. It\\'s still a small business for us, but we actually believe, in addition to the goodness around Ryzen and EPYC, when we launch those products, Ryzen and EPYC Embedded, we actually saw very strong interest from customers. And so we think as the product strength in our PC and our server business increased, they will also help that Embedded solutions business overall. So I would think it\\'s still a small piece of the business, but we believe it will be a nice growing margin accretive portion of the business over the next couple of years.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSrinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, question on the ASPs. I think you said the ASPs went up because of the Ryzen mix improving. Can you give us some more color as to where Ryzen is, in terms of the mix? And then with Ryzen 2, do you expect that to be accretive to ASPs and margins?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So in terms of the client business, we saw units up overall. We saw ASPs up overall, and they were up in both desktop and mobile. And when you look underneath that, I think, what -- the main thing is we\\'re seeing a larger mix of the business become Ryzen. So in the fourth quarter, we had stated that the Ryzen mix of the client business was kind of in the low 40s. And so we had in notebook a lot of legacy product that we\\'re still shipping, and in desktop, we had some legacy product that we\\'re still shipping. As we move over to the first quarter, the notebook mix has mixed nicely into Ryzen, and the desktop is now mixed very nicely into Ryzen as well. So overall, that\\'s what led to the ASP increase. I think the second generation Ryzen is a very, very good product. I think it\\'s -- it actually -- when you look at the first generation Ryzen, we were very good on multithreaded performance, but there were some detractors around single threaded and gaming performance. I think the second generation Ryzen is actually much more competitive on gaming performance. So we do see an opportunity for that to help us increase share in the desktop business, and certainly, that would be accretive to margin.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSrinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And then one question on the server business. I guess, your target is to get to a mid-single-digit share by end of this year, which is a fairly gradual ramp. I\\'m just curious as to when you expect the 7-nanometer part to be available in the market? And when that happens, do you see an inflection to your share gains or do you continue you expect gradual share gains?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So all of the sales this year will be around of the current generation of Ryzen, and so that gets us to the mid-single-digit share. 7-nanometer Zen 2-based product we\\'ll sample later this year to customers and that will be in production in 2019, and we do believe that the adoption rate of the second generation could potentially be higher than the adoption rate of the first generation, mostly because customers will be more familiar with our systems and our products. And so we\\'ll see how it goes, but we certainly -- our overall goals are ambitious in the server space. And so this year, its first generation Ryzen, next year, we\\'ll mix in the 7-nanometer, second-generation -- I\\'m sorry, first generation EPYC. And next year, we\\'ll mix in the second generation of the EPYC products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          My first question\\'s on the competitive landscape in the AI space. I was just wondering how you\\'re thinking about your positioning relative not only on your biggest competitor there, NVIDIA, but also new entrants that potentially can be working on custom solutions? And then I have a follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So the AI market is certainly growing very, very fast. Relative to the competitive landscape, we are a new entrant. I think our GPU compute hardware is very good. I think we have a strong roadmap that we are -- we\\'re putting in place for that. I think on the software side, we have more work to do, and we\\'re making significant investments in some of the machine learning frameworks, such as Tensor Flow and Caffe, and some of these key frameworks, to ensure that we make it easier to adopt our solutions. But we see this is a multiyear, really, opportunity for us. So GPU compute will continue to be a focus area for us. We think we can be very competitive and we\\'re going to continue to invest in this area. As it relates to, let\\'s call it, non-GPU solutions, I think there will -- the landscape says there will be some ASIC solutions in the marketplace, but I view that as complementary to the GPU solutions and, from that standpoint, I think we have the CPUs, we have GPUs, and then we have the ability to connect heterogeneously to these other elements. So yes, from our standpoint again, we see this as a market that very much fits our capability, and we will continue to invest in it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And then my follow-up\\'s on the upcoming shareholder meeting. And then one of the proposals is to increase the authorized share authorization by about 700 million shares. Obviously, my understanding is that, that wouldn\\'t be dilutive initially, but just wondering how you\\'re thinking about potential uses of those -- that share is?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So you\\'re correct. There is a proposal in the -- at the shareholder meeting. It is not going to be dilutive to begin with, and it\\'s really good housekeeping. We don\\'t have any particular plans at this point.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. Next question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have 2 questions. One was just a follow-up to what, Lisa, you were talking about on the machine learning side. When do we see -- or so just give us an update of where you are in traction and should we expect any meaningful revenues on that front from AMD in this year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I think last year, we announced a partnership with Baidu to do software optimizations of -- for machine learning. And we have several other partnerships with others in this area. So there\\'s a lot of interest. I think the time for meaningful revenue, we will see some revenue in the second half of the year and that\\'s part of the growth in the margin expansion story. And I think into 2019 and 2020, this will be continue an area of growth for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then for my follow-up, just getting back to the discrete graphics in the quarter reported. The channel was really dry heading into the first quarter. So where are we on the channel inventory? And is there any way for you to help us understand how much of the growth was driven by the buildup in the channel in the March quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so the channel inventory did -- the channel inventory was at very, very low levels going into the quarter, and frankly, it was hard to get the GPU -- it was hard to get GPUs. I think if you look now on typical retailer/e-tailer sites, the channel inventory is good. And I think there was an element of channel replenishment, but from what we see of inventory levels today, they\\'re, I would say, normal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And what is the normal level, Lisa, in terms of weeks?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Maybe somewhere between 4 and 5 weeks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, a couple questions. Can you comment qualitatively about the competitive dynamic that you\\'re seeing in microprocessors? And as a second question, can you give us an update on Spectre, in terms of the impact it\\'s had on the business going forward?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Hans. So on the microprocessor side, I think, with the competitive landscape, as we see it, Ryzen and EPYC are very competitive. And we\\'ve seen that in head-to-head design opportunities. I think from a CPU standpoint, we\\'re very pleased with that. I think second generation Ryzen in 12-nanometer actually improves the overall performance, and so we like how that positions us on the PC side. I think as we look forward, and I think this is important, we believe that the 7-nanometer capability of The Foundry ecosystem is very good, and that puts us in a good competitive spot from a manufacturing standpoint. And then on the design side, obviously, we have things that we\\'re planning. And so I see the competitive environment as one that is as good, and we\\'re going to work very hard to make sure that it gets better over time. Obviously, we take the competition very seriously. Oh, yes, and the second question -- sorry, about that, Hans -- on Spectre. We have spent a good amount of time with our customer set to make sure that they\\'re fully protected on Spectre. We\\'ve actually released a number of software mitigations already to our OEM customers and to our partners. They\\'re in the process of deploying. So I think it took a lot of energy, certainly, we spent a lot of time on it and our customer set spent time on it. But we don\\'t see any long-term effects. It\\'s more that we want to make sure to get the work done quickly, and that\\'s been our focus.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Hans. Operator, we have time for 2 more questions, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wanted to ask you, I think you mentioned double-digit sequential growth in the CT business. I was just kind of curious what stage you\\'re on in terms of channel fill for Ryzen Mobile business? And then I have one more follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we did, and as I mentioned, have some mobile product shipped ahead of OEM system launches in the second quarter. But we see this really as the beginning of the Ryzen ramp. So my expectation is that the client or the Ryzen portion of our business will be up in the second quarter and it will be up in the second half. And so it\\'s the beginning of the notebook ramp.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And I wanted to ask just on the OpEx side, Devinder. Just in terms of licensing gains that have been OpEx offset, do you expect any of those gains this year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think there could be, but it\\'s hard to tell because it\\'s kind of dependent upon the milestone that come into play. There was the OpEx offset last year that got reversed, but we\\'ll see it when it happens from a milestone standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think, Blayne, just as a point of clarification on this point. From an IP standpoint, we\\'re not forecasting IP either here in the second quarter or into the second half. I think as Devinder said, we do have some IP arrangements that we\\'re working on, and depending on when those milestones complete, we will then sort of forecast it into the business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question today is coming from Gus Richard from Northland.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAuguste Philip Richard,  Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Real, real quickly, can you just tell me if the 12-nanometer is a die shrink or just performance improvement?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [73]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It is -- yes, Gus, it is primarily performance improvement, and it is some design improvements. So you see some of the latency improvements and so on. It is not a die shrink.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [74]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\\'d like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s it for our call for today. We thank you very much for joining us. Look forward to seeing you at the Morgan Stanley conference and at the Cowan conference. And as always, we thank you for your support of AMD.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude tonight\\'s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Before covering our quarterly results, I wanted to provide some comments addressing our response to COVID-19. First, I want to recognize the toll the pandemic has taken on the world. The breadth and speed at which COVID-19 has changed the world since our last earnings call has been staggering. I want to thank the countless healthcare professionals and essential workers serving on the front lines every day.\\\\nAt AMD, our first priority has been to protect the health and safety of our employees. We have transitioned the vast majority of our more than 12,000 employees worldwide to working from home, while ensuring we maintain focus on reliably supplying our customers with the products and services their businesses depend on.\\\\nWe are also supporting the communities we call home through financial and personal protective equipment donations and providing our technology to accelerate medical research. More than ever, the pandemic has placed technology at the forefront of how we work, learn, shop and connect. And we are proud to be providing many of the components powering these essential technologies. Against that backdrop, we performed well in the first quarter.\\\\nRevenue increased 40% year-over-year to $1.79 billion as demand for 7-nanometer Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processors drove record first quarter revenue and our highest gross margin in 8 years. I\\'m pleased with our execution in the quarter, as we quickly adopted our global operations to navigate pockets of supply chain disruption and addressed geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19.\\\\nTurning to our Computing and Graphics segment. First quarter segment revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $1.44 billion, driven by increased Ryzen and Radeon processor adoption. We saw some softness based on the COVID-19 situation in China that impacted PC related sales in the first quarter. While both component and system demand were relatively strong at online vendors, off-line channel sales were weaker-than-expected as many retail locations across China were closed for much of the quarter.\\\\nPC demand in the rest of the world was strong, offsetting the softness in China. Client processor revenue grew significantly year-over-year as strong Ryzen processor demand resulted in significant double-digit percentage increases in unit shipments and ASP. As a result, we believe we gained client unit market share for the 10th straight quarter.\\\\nIn desktop, overall demand for our latest Ryzen 3000 and prior generation Ryzen 2000 processor families was strong, both of which continue to top retailer best seller lists and have more than 50% share of premium processor sales at many top global e-tailers.\\\\nIn mobile, unit shipments increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year. We set a record for quarterly notebook processor revenue driven by sustained demand for our previous generation offerings and the ramp of the first Ryzen Mobile 4000 design wins. Initial consumer notebooks featuring our new Ryzen 4000 processors launched to strong demand based on reviews that demonstrated their performance and battery life leadership for ultrathin and gaming notebooks. We also gained momentum in the commercial market, winning multiple large-scale deployments as Lenovo announced new ThinkPads and HP launched commercial class ProBooks powered by our latest Ryzen 4000 mobile processors. We are on track to accelerate our mobile growth this year as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other OEMs are expected to launch more than 135 new Ryzen-powered consumer and commercial notebooks over the coming quarters.\\\\nIn graphics, first quarter unit shipments and revenue both grew by a double-digit percentage year-over-year, driven largely by sales of our Radeon RX 5000 series, desktop and notebook GPUs. Desktop channel sales increased based on solid demand for both 7-nanometer RDNA graphics cards and previous-generation Radeon RX 500 series GPUs.\\\\nIn mobile, demand for notebooks powered by our Radeon 5000M mobile GPUs, including the latest Apple MacBook Pro and other gaming notebooks, drove a richer mix as customers transition their platforms to our new RDNA mobile offerings.\\\\nDevelopment of our RDNA 2 GPUs continues to progress well. We are on track to launch our next-generation gaming GPUs later this year with a 50% performance per watt increase compared to our current offerings. In the data center, Microsoft Azure introduced new virtual machines optimized for visualization workloads powered by our Radeon Instinct MI25 GPUs.\\\\nMicrosoft is using our differentiated virtualization technology to partition a GPU for the first time in the same way they partition multi-core CPUs, allowing customers to tailor the GPU capability to meet the needs of their specific workload.\\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue of $348 million decreased 21% year-over-year as lower semi-custom revenue more than offset a significant increase in server revenue. As expected, semi-custom product revenue was negligible in the quarter, as Sony and Microsoft both reduced inventory in advance of next-generation console launches.\\\\nWe expect semi-custom revenue to increase in the second quarter and be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year as we ramp production to support the holiday launches of the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles.\\\\nIn server, unit shipments grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially and more than tripled year-over-year as we continue gaining momentum across cloud, enterprise and HPC customers. We saw particular strength with cloud providers introducing new instances and accelerating current deployments. Microsoft Azure, Google and IBM, all announced new offerings powered by second generation EPYC processors, highlighted by Google launching multiple general purpose VMs and Microsoft rolling out an all-AMD virtual desktop offering that also includes Radeon Instinct GPUs.\\\\nSeveral cloud providers accelerated their infrastructure deployments to address rising demand from the growing number of users working and schooling from home. For instance, one of our large cloud customers was able to deploy 10,000 2nd Gen EPYC servers in less than 10 days to support the surge in demand for their collaboration services.\\\\nIn the enterprise, we expanded our 2nd Gen EPYC processor portfolio with new high-frequency processors that expand our performance leadership to advanced modeling, database and hyperconverged workloads. With these new offerings, our 2nd Gen EPYC processor family now includes both the highest performance per core and performance per socket processors in the industry. We continue winning in HPC, highlighted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, announcing they selected next-generation AMD EPYC CPUs and Radeon Instinct GPUs to power their El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to deliver more than 2 exaFLOPS of computing performance when it is deployed in early 2023. We are incredibly proud that 2 of the 3 publicly announced U.S. exascale supercomputing systems will exclusively use AMD CPUs and GPUs, clearly positioning AMD as the exascale computing leader based on our high-performance computing and graphics technologies and software capabilities.\\\\nIn closing, our long-term strategy and growth drivers remain unchanged. Although there are some near-term uncertainties in the demand environment, we are well positioned to navigate through this situation. We have a solid financial foundation, and our product portfolio is very well positioned across the PC, gaming and data center markets. While demand indicators across commercial, education and data center infrastructure markets are strong, we expect some softness in consumer demand in the second half of the year, depending on how overall macroeconomic conditions evolve. We remain on track to launch our next-generation Zen 3 CPUs and RDNA 2 GPUs in late 2020 and believe we can deliver another year of strong revenue growth and margin expansion based on the strength of our product portfolio and the diversity of markets we serve.\\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We performed well in the first quarter as we navigated a challenging environment as a result of the ongoing impact of COVID-19. First quarter revenue was $1.79 billion, up 40% from a year ago and down 16% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon products, partially offset by lower semi-custom sales.\\\\nGross margin was 46%, up 490 basis points from a year ago, driven by Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. Operating expenses were $584 million compared to [$498] (corrected by the company after the call) million a year ago, primarily due to increased investments in R&D and go-to-market activities.\\\\nOperating income was $236 million, up $152 million from a year ago, driven by revenue growth and a greater percentage of Ryzen and EPYC processor sales, while operating margin increased to 13% as compared to 7% a year ago.\\\\nNet income was $222 million, up from $62 million a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.18 per share compared to $0.06 per share a year ago.\\\\nNow turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.44 billion, up 73% year-over-year, driven by Ryzen processor and Radeon product channel sales growth. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $262 million or 18% of revenue compared to $16 million a year ago, driven by significantly higher revenue. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $348 million, down 21% from $441 million in the prior year due to the expected decline in semi-custom sales, partially offset by strong data center growth.\\\\nEESC segment had a loss of $26 million compared to operating income of $68 million a year ago, which included the benefit of a $60 million licensing gain.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion. In addition, in early April, we took the precautionary step to draw down $200 million from our $500 million revolving line of credit. Inventory was $1.1 billion, up 8% from the prior quarter.\\\\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 billion, resulting in gross leverage of 0.5x. Free cash flow was negative $120 million in the first quarter, an improvement of $155 million from the prior year. Cash flow from operations was negative $65 million, an improvement of $148 million from a year ago.\\\\nLet me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2020. Today\\'s outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current COVID-19 environment and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.85 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 21% year-over-year and an increase of approximately 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by strong growth in Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. The sequential increase is driven primarily by EPYC processor and semi-custom sales.\\\\nIn addition, for Q2 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 44% due to higher semi-custom revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $600 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $20 million, and the diluted share count in the second quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.\\\\nFor the full year 2020, despite expectations of weaker COVID-19-related consumer demand in the second half of the year, we expect annual revenue growth of approximately 25%, plus or minus 5 percentage points. In addition, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 45%, unchanged from prior guidance and non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 29% on revenue.\\\\nIn closing, while the market environment has become more challenging given the impact of COVID-19, our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. Notwithstanding some near-term demand uncertainties, our long-term strategy is unchanged, and we are well positioned with our competitive products and the strength of our balance sheet to navigate today\\'s environment.\\\\nAs I finish, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees for their dedication, flexibility and focus in these extraordinary times.\\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. And operator, if you could poll the audience for questions, please?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsey from Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And I hope everyone at AMD is doing well considering the interesting times there have been. Lisa, I wanted to start with a couple of questions on the server business. I guess, one of which is, how do you -- the EESC results in the quarter that you just printed were a bit below, at least where I had modeled them. So maybe you could talk a bit about how you feel the EPYC business is tracking toward that sort of 10% target you guys had set for the second quarter. And I notice in Devinder\\'s comments on the June quarter guidance, most -- some of the upside is going to be driven -- I guess, upside sequentially is going to be driven by EPYC. So how are you tracking against that? And then the last little piece is, I keep getting more and more questions still about the timing of Milan. And I know you guys reiterated that would be this year at the Analyst Day. And if that\\'s still the case, just let us know.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Absolutely, Matt. Thank you, and I appreciate the question. So look, we are very pleased with the progress in our server business. I think if you look at sort of the progress we\\'ve made, there were a number of key things that we wanted to see happen. What we saw in the quarter that we just finished, in the first quarter, we actually saw a very nice acceleration of the cloud business as we went through the quarter. I think as we go into the second quarter, there\\'s an additional significant ramp of the server business. And so we expect to continue to gain share as we go through these next couple of quarters. I think what we\\'re seeing from the current COVID-19 environment, obviously, there\\'s a lot of puts and takes. But as it relates to data center, it\\'s positive for the data center market. Certainly, we\\'ve seen some of our largest customers ask us to accelerate some of our deployments. And we look forward to continuing to ramp our server business. I think you asked about Milan, and yes, we are expecting to be launching that at the end of this year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Just wanted to switch quickly into the PC business. One of the things that stood out to me from your commentary in the prepared script was the contrast between strength in the PC business globally versus the weakness in China. I imagine that weakness in China was both on the PC side and on the AIB graphics business. If there\\'s any way that you help quantify that? And we\\'ve heard some commentary about the economy restarting in China. Have you seen some of those trends start to improve into the second quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So the PC business has actually held up pretty well. So if we look at the PC business in the first quarter, we saw the rest of the world PC business actually get some benefit from some of the acceleration in demand sort of towards the end of the quarter. We did see some weakness in China as China was shut down in the months of February and early March. We saw that primarily in the channel business, so in offline channels. Now we have seen that pick up as we\\'ve gone through the month of April. And what we\\'re seeing in general in the PC business is the first quarter and the second quarter is actually relatively strong with accelerated notebook demand and desktops sequentially lower just based on sort of the preference around notebook versus desktop in this framework. So those are the key dynamics for the PC business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You guys are one of the few companies kind of giving a full year guidance. And I just wonder if you could talk us through how you\\'re thinking about the second half? Obviously, you guys have OEM visibility into a bunch of new sockets and new designs, but your customers don\\'t seem to have visibility. So just a little bit more color maybe on how you are thinking about forecasting beyond the visibility that you have in Q2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Sure, Joe. So look, we understand that there\\'s a lot of questions about visibility as we go into the second half of the year. The way we look at our business is, we have sort of a lot of positives in terms of just market drivers that we do have good visibility too. I think our progress in the data center market is a positive. We see that with a number of platforms ramping and the number of customers that we have coming on board. So we see that as a positive for us as we go through this year.\\\\nConsole gaming is a positive for us. There\\'s lots of anticipation around the consoles. It\\'s one of the largest launches, I think, of the year. And from that standpoint, there\\'s no change in our view as it relates to COVID-19, just given what we see today. Now as you look at the range, we have increased the range of our guide. And sort of the biggest sort of question mark in my mind is kind of the shape of the PC market this year. As I mentioned earlier, the first half actually looks a little bit stronger than expected, particularly on the notebook side. We are potentially expecting some weakness in the second half due to consumer spending. You sort of have the 2 -- the 2 forces are there. I mean, one is, there is a pull with the strong work-from-home trends, but then there\\'s also the view that, from a macro standpoint, will be weaker in the second half of the year. So that\\'s -- the primary variance in our model is what happens to the PC market. I will say, though, that underneath the market trends, we\\'re very pleased with our portfolio. I mean, the notebook portfolio that we have in PCs is the strongest we\\'ve ever had. And we believe we have a good opportunity to gain share throughout the year, even as the market may be a little bit weaker than originally expected. So that\\'s the reason for the guidance to try to give the puts and takes. And of course, we\\'ll see how the year plays out.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s helpful. And then in terms of data center GPU, I know you talked a lot about the Analyst Day about the newer products and penetration of new workloads in the second half. Can you talk about the workloads that you\\'ve been addressing so far, cloud gaming and whatnot? And how is that business progressing before we get to the CDNA launch?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So the data center GPU business is an important strategic business. In terms of size, it\\'s still relatively small compared to the data center CPU business. We are making progress, good overall progress in a number of workloads. Cloud gaming is one that has been a good one for us, and we continue to see opportunity in that as we go through this year, with the current product set. We also just launched the VDI instance with Microsoft Azure, which we feel will be a good workload for us. And then we have a number of the HPC wins that we\\'ve talked about that are going to be based on the CDNA architecture, which is an important strategic area for us as well as continued focus on improving our machine learning and overall machine learning frameworks and capabilities. So those are the key workloads that we\\'re going after. And I do think it\\'s an important business for us as we go forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, for my first one, I just wanted to go back to your EPYC server business. So very strong units in Q1, but it appears that the mix was very kind of cloud-heavy. So perhaps ASPs were lower than we are used to seeing. I was wondering if you could just give us some sense of how we should think about server ASPs going forward. And importantly, if you think of server sales for you for this year versus what you thought 90 days ago, how is that looking like? Because I think your competitors said that they expected some kind of digestion of cloud capacity in the back half. So I was just hoping to get some more color around ASP and just what you thought of your overall server business for this year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Vivek. Yes. So that is correct. There was a mix shift towards cloud in the first quarter, and that did have an impact with ASPs lower. That being the case, the ASPs are very healthy. So I think from the standpoint of how our business evolves, it\\'s within the plus or minus of the business model. In terms of where we believe demand will be versus 90 days ago, it\\'s pretty similar. And the way I would say it is, we see cloud being strong. What we see is not just putting on more capacity, but really the ramping of new platforms. And so we view that as a positive. We have strong enterprise adoption as well. When we look at our pipeline in enterprise, it\\'s continued to grow, and continued to grow in the first quarter and continued to grow in sort of the first month here of the second quarter. We do expect, perhaps at the transactional business, sort of the SMB type of business may be more impacted by COVID-19, but that was never a large piece of our business to begin with. So we feel good about the server business. And it continues to be a very strategic focus for us. I think the relationships with our partners and our customers are getting closer as we go through sort of the process of ramping volumes. And so we continue to view it as a strong growth driver for us on a year-over-year basis.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Very helpful. And then maybe a follow-up for Devinder on gross margins. So first half, kind of tracking towards your 45-ish percent target for the year, but Q2 is 44%. And I recall, I think either Lisa or Devinder, you said that second half will be more semi-custom weighted, but that suggests some more pressure on gross margins. So I was just hoping you could walk us through how we should think about gross margins in the back half, given all the puts and takes of mix that you are expecting?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I think the key puts and takes, as you said, continued ramp for the semi-custom, which has margins, as you observed lower than corporate average, but they are offset by the strength in the data center revenue. So semi-custom ramped the back half, and that does impact the gross margin being lower than corporate average. But data center strength, as Lisa just referenced, that we are pleased with the ramp in the data center business. In data center business, the margins are significantly higher than corporate average, and has the offset to help us deliver as we guided for 2020, the 45% gross margin for 2020.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Maybe, Vivek, I can just add to that. So in addition to the data center mix that Devinder mentioned, we also expect to see the console gross margins improve as we go through the year. And that\\'s the reason for the full year guide at 45%. So usually, what happens is in the very -- second quarter is our very first quarter of ramp for the consoles, and so the margin starts a little bit lower and continues to ramp as we go through the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the -- first question on the client side. I guess, AMD has historically had a good presence on the consumer side, but it sounds like you\\'re making great progress on the commercial side with the HP and ThinkPad design wins. Can you give us a sense roughly like what is the split between consumer and commercial on the notebook side? And like how does that play going forward? Does commercial just continue to grow faster than the consumer side? And is there an impact on the gross margin between -- if commercial does grow faster? That\\'s the first question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Mark. So our PC business does tend to be much more consumer weighted. I mean, we\\'ve made progress in commercial. Commercial has grown nicely, but it\\'s still consumer weighted. We expect to continue to gain commercial share as we go through this year. As that happens, I think there\\'s 2 things in the PC margins that affect PC gross margins. Heavier weight of commercial is certainly positive for the overall gross margins. I think the other pieces, we should expect that education will be strong and that tends to be lower in the mix. And so there are lots of mix dynamics. But overall, I think our confidence level in notebooks being a strong growth driver for us as we go through this year is good. And we continue to work on the commercial versus consumer mix.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. That\\'s helpful. And then on the server side, if you look at cloud instances versus cloud internal versus enterprise versus HPC, can you give us a sense of the split today, if not by percentage and like a rank order? And what you would expect to drive going forward? Our own field work had indicated that your instances were growing nicely on EPYC 2. I wondered to what extent is that being deployed internally on the cloud guys also?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Mark. So when you look at our cloud instances, I would say that our cloud -- some of the cloud acceleration I referred to was acceleration of internal workloads at some of our top cloud customers. So I think that\\'s an area actually where we get more visibility. Cloud instances in terms of numbers for external usage has grown. We announced the GCP platform. We announced the IBM platform as well as additional Microsoft platforms. You will see more cloud instances rollout over the next quarter or so. But much of the growth that we\\'ve seen has been around internal deployment of the cloud companies. And then as it relates to enterprise, it is more heavily weighted towards HPC. We\\'ve done very, very well in HPC. We\\'re pretty excited about our new high-frequency SKUs that were just launched here in April. They\\'re actually very well suited for large enterprise applications and financial sector as well as some of the technology sectors, and so that\\'s a key focus for us in terms of growing those other pieces of the enterprise business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First, harp a little bit again on the server business. I guess I don\\'t quite understand why a big shift toward cloud mix will drive ASPs down sequentially. I mean, your mix has been mostly cloud all along. So why all of a sudden is that driving ASPs down? And I know you said units were up double digits. I guess, in that context, what did revenues do sequentially? And maybe what were data center revenues, CPU plus GPU, as a percentage of total in the quarter? Like, if you could give any color on any of that, that would be really helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So we did have a positive cloud mix, but I would say that the Q4 to Q1 mix had significant improvement in cloud or significant growth in cloud. So that was the ASP sort of shift that we talked about. As it relates to data center overall, we were in the high teens this quarter. And you had one other question, Stacy?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I said, what did revenues do sequentially? Units were up, like, double digits.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. The revenues were also up sequentially. Not as much as units, but revenues were sequentially -- yes.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. So my follow-up. Again, I want to talk a little bit about the share target. So I know you\\'d said 10% share, give or take, by the middle of this year. If I even just take your entire EESC revenue and I take Intel\\'s data center revenue this quarter, you\\'d be about 5% revenue share. And I know you\\'re guiding for growth next quarter, but I mean, just given the magnitude, it doesn\\'t feel like that\\'s going to double in the quarter. So just how are you feeling about that 10% guide for the middle of this year? Is that getting pushed out? Are we defining it wrong? Like how should we be thinking about that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So the way we define the share target, and it very much is sort of the view of -- we expect about 20 million units a year in terms of single-socket and dual-socket servers. That\\'s about 5 million units a quarter. So 10% share is about 0.5 million units. From where we look today, we look to be on track to that. Q2 is actually...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s about Q2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Yes. Q2 is actually our strongest backlog quarter that we\\'ve seen. So I think that\\'s our current visibility today.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Is that 20 million an appropriate number, though, given you\\'re now playing in comm whereas maybe when you gave that target before you weren\\'t playing in comm? Isn\\'t the total target at -- total market is more like 30 million or even more, right?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, again, I think not to go back on how we define the target. I think I\\'ve given you how we define the target. And I think that\\'s an appropriate way to define the target. I think our comms exposure is very, very early. And I would say, is not a significant part of the revenue at this point.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I wanted to go back to your full year guide. I appreciate there\\'s a wide range of outcomes here, and you did put up an updated number. But if we take the midpoint of your updated guidance and we compare and contrast that with your old guidance, you are lowering the midpoint of your revenue outlook by about $250 million, maybe a little bit more. In response to Joe\\'s question, I think you focused very much on the notebook business. Is that sort of the primary part of your business where you\\'re lowering numbers? Or is it a little bit more broad-based across GPU and perhaps the game console business as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I would say from the full year standpoint, the biggest variable is the PC business in its entirety. So that\\'s notebook and desktop. And like I said, it\\'s a variable, if I -- you can model various scenarios as to what it can be. And I think from our standpoint, when we started the year, we had the expectation of a pretty normal PC environment. I think we would all say that the environment is different than when we started. And given the size of that market, we have given ourselves a wide range. As it relates to what we thought before, it\\'s priority PCs. And when you look at the other markets, game consoles, data center were about what we expected, and the signals continued to be positive in those areas. And by the way, I should -- I\\'m sorry, if I can just finish off. On PCs , I would say though that, I think we\\'re all waiting to see some of the data as we go through the second half of the year. So I want to say that, like I said, there\\'s those 2 competing forces. One is, there\\'s a strong pull for work-from-home trends and the other is just what is the impact on macro going to be for discretionary consumer spend. And so I think that\\'s a place where we lack full visibility. And we continue to talk to customers. And I think we\\'re all trying to make sure that we are well prepared for any of the scenarios as they come about.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Appreciate that. And then as a quick follow-up, Lisa, I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape. Your nearest competitor continues to grow wafer capacity, as you know, and they talked quite a bit about accelerating the RAM for 10 last week on their call. Are you seeing any changes in how they compete in the marketplace, either from a pricing perspective or from a marketing dollar perspective relative to how you saw the market 90 days ago?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No. It\\'s -- the PC market is always a competitive market. And from that standpoint, I don\\'t think the environment has changed substantially from a -- either a capacity standpoint or a marketing dollar standpoint. From our view, it\\'s all about ensuring that the platforms that we launch actually ramp into production smoothly. And so we\\'ve been working on that. And we feel very good about that. I think we mentioned that we have a significant number of platforms, over 135 mobile platforms that are coming to market here in 2020. And they\\'re very, very competitive. They are some of our best platforms from just overall performance and capability standpoint. So we\\'re bullish on our ability to turn that into revenue growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So let me ask you a question. Lisa, not to kind of go back to the same well as everybody else, but I wanted to hit on the EPYC side of things. I guess the good news is you guys are growing very rapidly and taking share, and you reiterated that 10% market share goal for the June quarter. But overall, it seems like the number has not really upsided anybody\\'s expectations over the last few quarters, despite the market accelerating from a demand perspective, your primary competitor upsiding their data center group or even their cloud segment within that for 3 to 4 quarters in a row. So I just wanted to get your feeling on, is there something that is capping the growth there? Is it the ASP is going down because of who the customers are? I\\'m just wondering why if the market is as strong as it seemed to be for the last 3 or 4 quarters, you\\'re doing really well, but not actually upsiding our expectation?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Ross, the way I look at it, and I mean, this was very, very similar to the ramp that we saw in PC business. The ramp in server is something like steady as she goes. And each quarter, we add platforms; each quarter, more platforms are qualified; each quarter, they ramp. It\\'s a little bit different from a pure market phenomenon. And again, I mean, I understand that there are market phenomena, and then there are growth expectations based on platform launches as well as software being qualified and so on and so forth. So as it relates to our expectations, it\\'s actually going quite well. As it relates to the acceleration of cloud, and we\\'re pleased with it. We\\'re not ready to upside numbers at this point. I think we want -- we already had very aggressive growth assumptions in what we went through. I think you\\'ll see us a little bit less market-specific and a little bit more AMD specific as it relates to our customers and their qualification plans. So I think we are confident that our data center business is doing well, and we need to continue to demonstrate that over a number of quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just for my follow-up, one that switch gears over to the computing and graphics side. Could you just give a little bit of color on what you expect for that in the second quarter? And then as you look into the second half, I know you mentioned that\\'s the area of greatest uncertainty for many logical reasons. But any sort of difference between the computing and the graphics side, both in your second quarter expectations and then the puts and takes in the back half of the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we are expecting that the computing and graphics business will be down sequentially. So it\\'s offsetting some of the growth on the EPYC and semi-custom side. Within the computing and graphics business, we see notebooks up strongly, as a result of the launch of our new Ryzen 4000 platforms and some of the other trends that we\\'ve talked about. We see desktop down sequentially, and we see graphics down sequentially. Q2 is normally a sequentially down quarter for the channel business for us. So that\\'s not unusual. And we -- that\\'s -- those are the dynamics in the second quarter. And as we go through the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we\\'ll have to see how consumer spending holds up against the other demand environments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, just my first question. I wonder if you could just help me kind of better understand in this current environment of shelter-in-place, how does that impact sort of new customer, new workload engagements? And I guess, to better kind of underscore that, just given that you\\'re expecting pretty good share gains in the back half of the year, given your second half guidance, notwithstanding the gaming cycle. Are most of those wins already in your back pocket, and so you\\'ve got high visibility? Or how do I think about that dynamic?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I think there are many that are already in progress. And that would be our -- sort of our typical view of how long it takes to ramp a customer from beginning of engagement to actual ramp, can it be anywhere from 6 to 9 months if that\\'s a good number. As it relates to what we see with the, as you call it, shelter-in-place, look, we see pretty strong activity. I mean, the activity level continues to be high on both the cloud as well as the enterprise side.\\\\nThe only place where perhaps we see a little bit of a slowdown is, as I said, on some of the transactional business, which we had plan to grow as we go through this year, and that might grow more slowly just as people aren\\'t focused on new infrastructure right now. But in terms of cloud and large enterprise, there continues to be good activity on both current already one design platforms as well as new pipeline engagements.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s helpful, Lisa. And as my follow-up, as you guys are painfully aware, one of the metrics that we probably focus probably too much on is just gross margin and gross margin progression. And given the gaming sort of ramp coming, it sort of convoluted the issue. So I was kind of hoping maybe you would quantify both in your Q2 guide and your full year guide, what impact the gaming console business is having on gross margins, i.e., what would gross margins be trending to right now ex gaming for both June and the full year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think, John -- go ahead. Go ahead, Devinder.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So if you look at Q2, if you\\'re asking the specific Q1 to Q2. Q2, we came in at the 46%, Q2 is down, and fundamentally primarily is due to the ramp in the game console revenue. As Lisa said earlier, we mentioned that the margins in the initial ramp of semi-custom revenue are typically lower and they do improve over time for semi-custom. But also from a company standpoint, when you look at the corporate average gross margin, it\\'s lower. And therefore, it is having an impact in terms of sequentially the margin is going down from Q1 to Q2.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          But I guess, Devinder, my question is, is the non-gaming gross margins continuing to move higher sequentially every quarter this year, i.e., is it more than 100 basis point impact from gaming in the June quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Go ahead. Go ahead, Lisa.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sorry, we\\'re -- Devinder and I are not in the same room. So the answer is yes, John. The impact of the sequential decline of 2 points is semi-custom. If you take semi-custom out, the rest of the portfolio would be -- what you would see in the rest of the portfolio is you would see server up and you would see desktop offset some of that. But the sequential decline is all semi-custom.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had two. I guess the first question, Devinder, I think you said that data center was high teens of revenue, so that would put it sort of in the low to mid 3s for March. Can you break out how much was CPU versus GPU? And I guess on the GPU side, that can be pretty lumpy. So anything to call out that\\'s assumed for June?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. It\\'s weighted towards the CPUs. If you take the data center CPUs and GPUs together, the revenue in Q1 is high teens of revenue in Q1, but primarily weighted towards the CPUs because that\\'s the area of growth from a server CPU business standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then I guess bigger picture question. So Lisa, I think there\\'s some new regulations in China that come into effect on June 1 around additional cybersecurity review for critical information infrastructure. And I would think that maybe you could fall under that. So any thought on how that could impact demand for you? And maybe if you could sort of tell us how much of your revenue on a consumption basis, do you think right now is in China?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we\\'re looking at that new regulation. So I don\\'t have any specifics at this point in time. We\\'ll continue to look at that new regulation. As it relates overall, I would say, the majority of our business in China is consumer or, let\\'s call it, consumer-related cloud.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Operator, we\\'ll take two more questions, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'ve got one and a follow-up. But the first one just kind of on the bookings you guys are saying. So I\\'m less worried about kind of the near-term revenue number you guys put up for server. But if you\\'re sitting here today and you compare that to a quarter ago, what do the bookings look like or backlog? Has that changed at all? Is that improving? Is it getting better or is it pretty much in line with what you guys expected in terms of the overall backlog?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think it\\'s -- I think I said earlier, but Mitch, it is certainly better. So we have better visibility a month into the quarter versus 90 days ago.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then the second one I had is just more broad. It\\'s on China, actually. So one thing we\\'re picking up is that a lot of the Chinese companies supposedly buying a lot of semiconductor chips ahead just in case they get banned from the U.S. and China relationship deterioration. So since you guys are not really involved in that, you\\'re more exposed to the hyperscale. Do you guys have any comments on what you guys think is actually happening there, if people are actually trying to build up -- I guess, build up an inventory level for semiconductor chips they think may get banned? Or do you think that\\'s kind of just noise, and it\\'s not really occurring right now in that geography?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Mitch, it\\'s a little bit hard for me to generalize. I would say, from what we see and we track both selling and consumption pretty closely, it looks like it\\'s normal patterns. But we don\\'t have exposure to some of the markets you\\'re talking about.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Maybe, Lisa, just looking at the fiscal guide, I\\'m kind of curious, if you look at first half versus second half, it seems like you still would require growth in computer graphics. I want to just make sure that was right. And then I\\'m just kind of curious how you think of the server, obviously, your share gainer. I think cloud and enterprise get intermingled together, particularly with this work-from-home. So I\\'m just kind of curious as you look at that business, first half and second half, do you -- I think Intel was talking about some weakness in enterprise and government. It\\'s not a big exposure for you, but just kind of curious how you\\'re thinking about, is there any headwind as that work-from-home spend holds off with server as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So as it relates to first half, second half, I mean, as we said, there\\'s -- the $8.4 billion plus or minus 5% is a wider than normal range for us. I think you can see outcomes within that range that would have computing and graphics up as well as you can see outcomes with it more flattish. So that being the case, so I think the trends that I talked about are likely the right trends, which is the consumer spending, perhaps a little softer, enterprise and commercial, a positive for us; notebook share gain, a positive for us; and we want to see how sort of the desktop channel behaves as we go into the second half of the year. And then your second question?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just kind of -- as you look at the server business, first half, second half, you had seen some -- you saw some strength in cloud in March and June. I\\'m kind of curious, are you thinking about -- is there any work-from-home benefits within that, that would then turn into a headwind in the second half?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Look, I think from what we see, we see mostly platforms ramping. And so that\\'s how we\\'re thinking about the data center business. Of course, we\\'re in this COVID-19 environment and so we\\'ll have to actually play out the next couple of quarters. But within the ranges that we see, we see an opportunity to continue growing in the second half of the year, given the visibility that we have with customers, the platforms that are ramping. And I still feel very much like we\\'re in the early stages of our 2nd Gen EPYC ramp. And I know it\\'s been a couple of quarters, but that\\'s just the way servers ramp. So we\\'re in the early stages of the ramp, lots of customer activity, significant pull from the customers to get up and running as soon as possible. And as you said, we don\\'t have as much exposure to some of the other end markets, which may have more volatility in the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\\'d like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Kevin. That concludes today\\'s call. We appreciate everybody participating, and stay safe, stay well. And we look forward to engaging with you throughout the quarter.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with record revenue in each of our 4 market platforms. And every measure of profit hit record levels, reflecting the leverage of our model. Data center revenue of $501 million more than doubled from a year ago and the strong adoption of our Volta platform and early traction with our inferencing portfolio.\\\\nQ3 revenue reached $2.64 billion, up 32% from a year earlier, up 18% sequentially and well above our outlook of $2.35 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 31% from last year to $2.22 billion. Tegra processor revenue rose 74% to $419 million.\\\\nLet\\'s start with our gaming business. Gaming revenue was $1.56 billion, up 25% year-on-year and up 32% sequentially. We saw robust demand across all regions and form factors. Our Pascal-based GPUs remained the platform of choice for gamers as evidenced by our strong demand for GeForce GTX 10-Series products. We introduced the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, which became available last week. It complements our strong holiday lineup ranging from the entry-level GTX 1050 to our flagship GTX 1080 Ti.\\\\nA wave of great titles is arriving for the holidays, driving enthusiasm in the market. We collaborated with Activision to bring Destiny 2 to the PC earlier in the month. PlayerUnknown\\'s Battlegrounds, popularly known as PUBG, continues to be one of the year\\'s most successful titles. We are closely aligned with PUBG to ensure that GeForce is the best way to play the game, including bringing shadow play highlights to its 20 million players. Last weekend, Call of Duty: WWII had a strong debut, and Star Wars Battlefront II will be out [soon].\\\\neSports remains one of the most important secular growth drivers in the gaming market with a fan base that now exceeds 350 million. Last weekend, the League of Legends World Championship was held in Beijing\\'s National Stadium, the Bird\\'s Nest, where the 2008 Olympics games were held. More than 40,000 fans attended live, and online viewers were set to break last year\\'s record of 43 million following in 18 languages.\\\\nGPU sales also benefited from continued cryptocurrency mining. We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business and a portion with GeForce GTX boards, though it\\'s difficult to quantify. We remain nimble in our approach to the cryptocurrency market. It is volatile, does not and will not distract us from focusing on our core gaming market. Lastly, Nintendo Switch console continues to gain momentum since launching in March and also contributed to growth.\\\\nMoving to data center. Our data center business had an outstanding quarter. Revenue of $501 million more than doubled from last year and rose 20% on the quarter amid strong traction of the new Volta architecture. Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3 driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing. As we have noted before, Volta delivers 10x the deep learning performance of our Pascal architecture, which has been introduced just a year earlier, far outpacing Moore\\'s Law.\\\\nThe V100 is being broadly adopted with every major server OEM and cloud provider. In China, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent announced that they are incorporating V100 in their data centers and cloud server service infrastructures. In the U.S., Amazon Web Services announced that V100 inferences are now available in 4 of its regions. Oracle Cloud has just added Tesla P100 GPUs to its infrastructure offerings and plans to expand to the V100 GPUs. We expect support from V100 from other major cloud providers as well.\\\\nIn addition, all major server OEMs announced support for the V100, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM and Supermicro are incorporating it in servers. And China\\'s top server OEMs, Huawei, Inspur and Lenovo have adopted our HGX server architecture to build a new generation of accelerated data centers with V100 GPUs.\\\\nOur new offerings for the AI inference market are also gaining momentum. The recently launched TensorRT 3 programmable inference acceleration platform opens a new market opportunity for us, improving the performance and reducing the cost of AI inferencing in order -- by orders of magnitude compared with CPUs. It supports every major deep learning framework, every network architecture and any level of network complexity. More than 1,200 companies are already using our inference platform including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, iFLYTEK, Hikvision and Tencent.\\\\nDuring the quarter, we announced that the NVIDIA GPU Cloud container registry, or NGC, is now available through Amazon\\'s cloud and will be supported soon by other cloud platforms. NGC helps developers get started with deep learning development through no-cost access to a comprehensive, easy-to-use, fully optimized deep learning software stack. It enables instant access to the most widely used GPU-accelerated frameworks.\\\\nWe also continue to see robust growth in our HPC business. Next-generation supercomputers, such as the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s Sierra and Summit systems expected to come online next year, leverage Volta\\'s industry-leading performance, and our pipeline is strong. The past weeks have been exceptionally busy for us. We have hosted 5 major GPU Technology Conferences in Beijing, Munich, Taipei, Tel Aviv and Washington with another next month in Tokyo. In a strong indication of the growing importance of GPU-accelerated computing, more than 22,000 developers, data scientists and others will come this year to our GTCs, including the main event in Silicon Valley. That\\'s up 10x in just 5 years. Other key metrics show similar gains. Over the same period, the number of NVIDIA GPU developers has grown 15x to 645,000, and the number of CUDA downloads this year are up 5x to 1.8 million.\\\\nMoving to professional visualization. Third quarter revenue grew to $239 million, up 15% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially driven by demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations. The defense and automotive industries grew strongly as the demand for professional VR solutions driven by Quadro P5000 and P6000 GPUs. Among key customers, Audi and BMW are deploying VR in auto showrooms. And the U.S. Army, Navy and Homeland Security are using VR for mission training.\\\\nLast month, we announced early access to NVIDIA Holodeck, the intelligent VR collaboration platform. Holodeck enables designers, developers and their customers to come together virtually from anywhere in the world in a highly realistic, collaborative and physically simulated environment. Future updates will address the growing demand for the development of deep learning techniques in virtual environments.\\\\nIn automotive, revenue grew to $144 million, up 13% year-over-year and up slightly from last quarter. Among key developments this quarter, we announced DRIVE PX Pegasus, the world\\'s first AI computer for enabling Level 5 driverless vehicles. Pegasus will deliver over 320 trillion operations per second, more than 10x its predecessor. It\\'s powered by 4 high-performance AI processors in a supercomputer that is the size of a license plate. NVIDIA DRIVE is being used by over 25 companies to develop fully autonomous robotaxis, and DRIVE PX Pegasus will become the path to production. It is designed for ASIL D certification, the industry\\'s highest safety level and will be available in the second half of 2018.\\\\nWe also introduced the DRIVE IX SDK for delivering intelligent experiences inside the vehicle. DRIVE IX provides a platform for car companies to create and always engage AI co-pilot. It uses deep learning networks to track head movement and gaze, and it will have a conversation with the driver using advanced speech recognition, lipreading and natural language understanding. We believe this will set the standard for the next generation of infotainment systems, a market that is just beginning to develop.\\\\nFinally, we announced that DHL, the world\\'s largest mail and package delivery service, and ZF, one of the world\\'s leading automotive suppliers, will deploy a test fleet of autonomous delivery trucks next year using the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform. DHL will outfit electric light trucks with the ZF ProAI self-driving system based on our technology.\\\\nNow turning to the rest of the income statement. Q3 GAAP gross margins was 59.5% and non-GAAP was 59.7%, both up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting continued growth in value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $674 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $570 million, consistent with our outlook and up 19% year-on-year. Investing in our key market opportunities is essential to our future, including gaming, AI and self-driving cars.\\\\nGAAP operating income was a record $895 million, up 40% from a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.01 billion, up 42% from a year ago. GAAP net income was a record $838 million, and EPS was $1.33, up 55% and 60%, respectively, from a year earlier. Non-GAAP net income was $833 million, and EPS was $1.33, up 46% and 41%, respectively from a year earlier, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion.\\\\nWe have returned $1.16 billion to shareholders so far this fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We have announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.01 to an annualized $0.60 effective with our Q4 fiscal year \\'18 dividend. We are also pleased to announce that we intend to return another $1.25 billion to shareholders for fiscal 2019 through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels, surpassing $1 billion for the first time to $1.16 billion.\\\\nNow turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $2.65 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.7% and 60%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $722 million and $600 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 17.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our website.\\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we will -- would you please pool for questions? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD     [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen, 3 months ago you described the July quarter as a transition quarter for your data center business. And clearly, you guys have ramped very well into October. But if you can talk a little bit about the outlook for the next couple of quarters in data center and particularly on the inferencing side. I know you guys are really excited about that opportunity. So if you can share customer feedback and what your expectations are into the next year in inferencing, that would be great.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, as you know, we started ramping very strongly Volta this last quarter, and we started the ramp the quarter before. And since then, every major cloud provider, from Amazon, Microsoft, Google to Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and even recently, Oracle, has announced support for Volta and we\\'ll be providing Volta for their internal use of deep learning as well as external public cloud services. We also announced that every major server computer maker in the world has now supported Volta and in the process of taking Volta out to market. HP and Dell and IBM and Cisco and Huawei in China, Inspur in China, Lenovo, have all announced that they will be building servers -- families of servers around the Volta GPU. And so I think we -- this ramp is just the first part of supporting the build out of GPU-accelerated servers from our company for data centers all over the world as well as cloud service providers all over the world. The applications for these GPU servers has now grown to many markets. I\\'ve spoken about the primary segments of our Tesla GPUs. There are 5 of them that I talk about regularly. The first one is high-performance computing where the market is $11 billion or so. It is one of the faster-growing parts of the IT industry because more and more people are using high-performance computing for doing their product development or looking for insights or predicting the market or whatever it is. And today, we represent about 15% of the world\\'s top 500 supercomputers. And I\\'ve repeatedly said and I believe this completely and I think it\\'s becoming increasingly true that every single supercomputer in the future will be accelerated somehow. So this is a fairly significant growth opportunity for us. The second is deep learning training, which is very, very much like high-performance computing. And you need to do computing at a very large scale. You\\'re performing trillions and trillions of iterations. The models are getting larger and larger. Every single year, the amount of data that we\\'re training with it is increasing. And the difference between a computing platform that\\'s fast versus not could mean the difference between building a $20 million data center or high-performance computing servers for training to $200 million. And so the money that we save and the capability we provide is really, the value is incredible. The third segment, and this is the segment that you just mentioned, has to do with inference, which is when you\\'re done with developing this network, you have to put it down into the hyperscale data centers to support the billions and billions of queries that consumers make to the Internet every day. And this is a brand-new market for us. 100% of the world\\'s inference is done on CPUs today. We announced very recently, this last quarter in fact, that TensorRT 3 inference acceleration platform and in combination with our Tensor Core GPU instruction set architecture, we\\'re able to speed up networks by a factor of 100. Now the way to think about that is imagine whatever amount of workload that you\\'ve got, if you could speed up using our platform by a factor of 100, how much you can save. The other way to think about that is because the amount of -- the networks are getting larger and larger, and they\\'re so complex now. And we know that every network on the planet will run on our architecture because they were trained on our architecture today. And so whether it\\'s CNNs or RNNs or GANs or autoencoders or all of the variations of those, irrespective of the precision that you need to support, the size of the network, we have the ability to support them. And so you could either scale out your hyperscale data center to support more traffic or you can reduce your cost tremendously or simultaneously, both. The fourth segment of our data center is providing all of that capability, what I just mentioned, whether it\\'s HPC, training or inference and turning it inside out and making it available in the public cloud. There are thousands of start-ups now that are in -- are started because of AI. Everybody recognizes the importance of this new computing model. And as a result of this new tool, this new capability, all these unsolvable problems in the past are now interestingly solvable. And so you can see start-ups cropping up all over the west, all over the east, and there\\'s just -- there are thousands of them. And these companies don\\'t either -- would rather not use their scarce financial resources to go build high-performance computing centers, or they don\\'t have the skill to be able to build out a high-performance platform the way these Internet companies can. And so these cloud providers, cloud platforms are just a fantastic resource for them because they could rent it by the hour. We created in conjunction with that, and I mentioned all the cloud service providers have taken it to market, in conjunction with that, we created a registry in the cloud that containerizes these really complicated software stacks. Every one of these soft frameworks with the different versions of our GPUs and different acceleration layers and different optimization techniques, we\\'ve containerized all of that for every single version and every single type of framework in the marketplace. And we put that up in the registry -- cloud registry called the NVIDIA GPU Cloud. And so all you had to do was download that into the cloud service provider that we\\'ve got certified and tested for, and with just one click, you\\'re doing deep learning. And then the last -- and so that\\'s the cloud service providers. If you -- the way to guess that -- estimate that is there are obviously tens of billions of dollars being invested in these AI start-ups. And some large proportion of their investment fund raise will ultimately have to go towards high-performance computing, whether they build it themselves or they rent it in the cloud. And so I think that\\'s a multibillion dollar opportunity for us. And then lastly, this is probably the largest of all the opportunities, which is the vertical industries. Whether it\\'s automotive companies that are developing their supercomputers to get ready for self-driving cars or health care companies that are now taking advantage of artificial intelligence to do better diagnostics of -- diagnosis of disease, to manufacturing companies to -- for in-line inspection, to robotics, large logistics companies. Colette mentioned earlier DHL. But the way to think about that is all of these planning -- all of these companies doing planning to deliver products to you through this large network of delivery systems, it is the world\\'s largest planning problem. And whether it\\'s Uber or Didi or Lyft or Amazon or DHL or UPS or FedEx, they all have high-performance computing problems that are now moving to deep learning. And so those are really exciting opportunities for us. And so the last one is just vertical industries. I mean, all of these segments, we\\'re now in a position to start addressing because we\\'ve put our GPUs in the cloud, all of our OEMs are in the process of taking these platforms out to market and we have the ability now to address high-performance computing and deep learning training as well as inference using one common platform. And so I think the -- we\\'ve been steadfast with the excitement of accelerated computing for data centers, and I think this is just the beginning of it all.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI had a question on your gaming seasonality into Q4. It\\'s usually up a bit. I was wondering, do you see any, I guess, drivers that would drive a lack of normal seasonal trends given how strong it\\'s been sequentially and year-over-year? And I guess as a related question, do you see your Volta volumes in Q4 exceeding Q3?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLet\\'s see. There\\'s -- I\\'ll answer the last one first and then work towards the first one. I think the guidance that we provided, we feel comfortable with. But if you think about Volta, it is just in the beginning of the ramp, and it\\'s going to ramp into the market opportunities I talked about. And so my hope is that we continue to grow, and there\\'s every evidence that the markets that we serve, that we\\'re addressing with Volta is -- are very large markets. And so there\\'s a lot of reasons to be hopeful about the future growth opportunities for Volta. We\\'ve primed the pump. So cloud service providers are either announce the availability of Volta or they announced the soon availability of Volta. They\\'re all racing to get Volta to their cloud because customers are clamoring for it. The OEMs are -- we\\'ve primed the pump with the OEMs, and some of them are sampling now and some of them are racing to get Volta to production in the marketplace. And so I think the foundation, the demand is there. The urgent need for accelerated computing is there because Moore\\'s Law is not scaling anymore, and then we\\'ve primed the pump. So the demand is there. There\\'s a need -- the need is there, and the foundations for getting Volta to market is primed. With respect to gaming, what drives our gaming business? Remember, our gaming business is sold one at a time to millions and millions of people. And what drives our gaming business is several things. As you know, eSports is incredibly, incredibly vibrant, and what drives -- the reason why eSports is so unique is because people want to win and having better gear helps. The latency that they expect is incredibly low, and performance drives down latency and they want to be able to react as fast as they can. People want to win, and they want to make sure that the gear that they use is not the reason why they didn\\'t win. The second growth driver for us is content, the quality of content. And boy, if you look at Call of Duty or Destiny 2 or PUBG, the content just looks amazing. The AAA content looks amazing. And one of the things that\\'s really unique about video games is that in order to enjoy the content and the fidelity of the content, the quality of the production value at its fullest, you need the best gear. It\\'s very different than streaming video, it\\'s very different than watching movies where streaming videos, it is what it is. But for video games, of course, it\\'s not. And so when AAA titles comes out in the later part of the year, it helps to drive platform adoption. And then lastly, increasingly, social is becoming a huge part of the growth dynamics of gaming. People are -- they recognize how beautiful these video games are, and so they want to share their brightest moments with people. They want to share the levels they discover. They want to take pictures of the amazing graphics that\\'s inside. And it is one of the primary drivers, the leading driver, in fact, of YouTube and people watching other people play video games, these broadcasters. And now with our Ansel, the world\\'s first in-game virtual reality and surround and digital camera, we have the ability to take pictures and share that with people. And so I think all of these different drivers are helping our gaming business, and I\\'m optimistic about Q4. It looks like it\\'s going to be a great quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Senior Equity Research Analyst and Fundamental Research Analyst    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI was hoping to sneak in a near-term and a longer-term question. On the near term, you talked about the health on demand side for Volta. Curious if you\\'re seeing any sort of restrictions on the supply side, whether it\\'s wafers or access to high-bandwidth memory, et cetera. And then the longer-term question really revolves around CUDA, and you\\'ve talked about that as being a sustainable competitive advantage for you guys entering the year. And now that we\\'ve moved beyond HPC and hyperscale training to more into inference and GPU as a service and you\\'ve hosted GTC around the world, curious if you could extrapolate on how you\\'re seeing that advantage and how you\\'ve seen it evolve over the year and how you\\'re thinking about CUDA as the AI standard.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thanks a lot, C.J. Well, everything that we build is complicated. Volta is the single largest processor that humanity has ever made, 21 billion transistors, 3D packaging, the fastest memories on the planet and all of that in a couple hundred watts, which basically says it\\'s the most energy-efficient form of computing that the world has ever known. And one single Volta replaces hundreds of CPUs. And so it\\'s energy-efficient. It saves an enormous amount of money. And it gets this job done really, really fast, which is one of the reasons why GPU-accelerated computing is so popular now. With respect to the outlook for our architecture, as you know, we are a one-architecture company, and it\\'s so vitally important. And the reason for that is because there are so much software and so much tools created on top of this one architecture. On the inference side -- on the training side, we have a whole stack of software and optimizing compilers and numerics libraries that are completely optimized for one architecture called CUDA. On the inference side, the optimizing compilers that takes these large, huge computational graphs that come out of all of these frameworks, and these computational graphs are getting larger and larger and their numerical precision differs from one type of network to another -- from one type of application to another. Your numerical precision requirements for a self-driving car, where lives are at stake, to detecting where -- counting the number of people crossing the street, counting something versus trying to track -- detect and track something very subtle in all kinds of weather conditions is a very, very different problem. And so numeric -- the type of networks are changing all the time. They\\'re getting larger all the time. The numerical precision is different for different applications. And we have different computing -- computer performance levels as well as energy availability levels that these inference compilers are likely to be some of the most complex software in the world. And so the fact that we have one singular architecture to optimize for, whether it\\'s HPC for numeric -- molecular dynamics and computational chemistry and biology and astrophysics, all the way to training to inference gives us just enormous leverage. And that\\'s the reason why NVIDIA could be an 11,000-people company and arguably, performing at a level that is 10x that. And the reason for that is because we have one singular architecture that\\'s -- that is accruing benefits over time instead of 3, 4, 5 different architectures where your software organization is broken up into all these different small subcritical mass pieces. And so it\\'s a huge advantage for us, and it\\'s a huge advantage for the industry. So people who support CUDA knows that the next-generation architecture will just get a benefit and go for the ride that technology advancement provides them and affords them. Okay. So I think it\\'s an advantage that is growing exponentially, frankly, and I\\'m excited about it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCongratulations on the strong results and the consistent execution. Jensen, in the last few months, we have seen a lot of announcements from Intel, from Xilinx and others describing other approaches to the AI market. My question is how does a customer make that decision whether to use a GPU or an FPGA or an ASIC, right? What is -- what can remain your competitive differentiator over the longer term? And does your position in the training market also then maybe give you a leg up when they consider solution for the inference part of the problem?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thank you, Vivek. So first of all, we have one architecture and people know that our commitment to our GPUs, our commitment to CUDA, our commitment to all of the software stacks that run on top of our GPUs, every single one of the 500 applications, every numerical solver, every CUDA compiler, every tool chain across every single operating system in every single computing platform, we are completely dedicated to it. We support the software for as long as we shall live, and as a result of that, the benefits to their investment in CUDA just continues to accrue. I -- you have no idea how many people send me notes about how they literally take out their old GPU, put in a new GPU and without lifting a finger, things got 2x, 3x, 4x faster than what they were doing before, incredible value to customers. The fact that we are singularly focused and completely dedicated to this one architecture and in an unwavering way allows everybody to trust us and know that we will support it for as long as we shall live. And that is the benefit of an architectural strategy. When you have 4 or 5 different architectures to support, that you offer to your customers and you ask them to pick the one that they like the best, you\\'re essentially saying that you\\'re not sure which one is the best. And we all know that nobody\\'s going to be able to support 5 architectures forever. And as a result, something has to give, and it would be really unfortunate for a customer to have chosen the wrong one. And if there\\'s 5 architectures, surely, over time, 80% of them will be wrong. And so I think that our advantage is that we\\'re singularly focused. With respect to FPGAs, I think FPGAs have their place, and we use FPGAs here in NVIDIA to prototype things and -- but FPGA is a chip design. It\\'s able to be a chip for -- it\\'s incredibly good at being a flexible substrate to be any chip, and so that\\'s its advantage. Our advantage is that we have a programming environment, and writing software is a lot easier than designing chips. And if it\\'s within the domain that we focus on, like, for example, we\\'re not focused on network packet processing, but we are very focused on deep learning. We\\'re very focused on high performance and parallel numerics analysis. If we\\'re focused on those domains, our platform is really quite unbeatable. And so that\\'s how you think through that. I hope that was helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Semiconductor Capital Equipment and Specialty Semiconductor Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette, on the last call you mentioned crypto was $150 million in the OEM line in the July quarter. Can you quantify how much crypto was in the October quarter and expectations in the January quarter directionally? And just longer term, why should we think that crypto won\\'t impact the gaming demand in the future? If you can just talk about the steps NVIDIA has taken with respect to having a different mode and all that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo in our results, in the OEM results, our specific crypto [boards] equated to about $70 million of revenue, which is the comparable to the $150 million that we saw last quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, longer term, Atif -- well, first of all, thank you for that. The -- longer term, the way to think about that is, is crypto is small for us but not 0. And I believe that crypto will be around for some time, kind of like today. There will be new currencies emerging. Existing currencies will grow in value. The interest in mining these new emerging currency crypto algorithms that emerge are going to continue to happen. And so I think for some time, we\\'re going to see that crypto will be a small but not 0, small but not 0 part of our business. The -- when you think about crypto in the context of our company overall, the thing to remember is that we\\'re the largest GPU computing company in the world. And our overall GPU business is really sizable and we have multiple segments. And there\\'s data center and I\\'ve already talked about the 5 different segments within data center. There\\'s ProVis and even that has multiple segments within it. Whether it\\'s rendering or computer-aided design or broadcast in a workstation, in a laptop or in a data center, the architectures are rather different. And of course, you know that we have high-performance computing. You know that we have autonomous machine business, self-driving cars and robotics. And you know, of course, that we have gaming. And so these different segments are all quite large and growing. And so my sense is that as -- although crypto will be here to stay, it will remain small but not 0.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJust following up on that last question. You mentioned that some of the crypto market had moved to traditional gaming. What drives that? Is there a lack of availability of the specialized crypto product? Or is it just that there\\'s a preference being driven for the gaming-oriented crypto solutions?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, Joe, I appreciate you asking that. Here\\'s the reason why. So what happens is, is when a crypto -- when a currency -- digital currency market becomes very large, it entices somebody to build a custom ASIC for it. And of course, Bitcoin is the perfect example of that. Bitcoin is incredibly easy to design as a specialized chip form. But then what happens is a couple of different players starts to monopolize the marketplace and as a result, it chases everybody out of the mining market and it encourages a new currency to evolve -- to emerge. And the new currency, the only way to get people to mine it is if it\\'s hard to mine, it\\'s hard to mine, okay, you got to put some effort into it. However, you want a lot of people to try to mine it. And so therefore, the platform that is perfect for it, the ideal platform for digital -- new emerging digital currencies turns out to be a CUDA GPU. And the reason for that is because there are several hundred million NVIDIA GPUs in the marketplace. If you want to create a new cryptocurrency algorithm, optimizing for our GPUs is really quite ideal. It\\'s hard to do. It\\'s hard to do, therefore, you need a lot of computation to do it. And yet there\\'s enough GPUs in the marketplace, it\\'s such an open platform that the ability for somebody to get in and start mining is very low barriers to entry. And so it\\'s the cycles of these digital currencies, and that\\'s the reason why I say that digital currency crypto usage of GPUs, crypto usage of GPUs will be small but not 0 for some time. And it\\'s small because when it gets big, somebody will go and build a custom ASIC. But if somebody builds a custom ASIC, there will be a new emerging cryptocurrency, so ebbs and flows.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Andrew Ellis,  B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior MD & Director of Research    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen, congratulations on data center annualizing at $2 billion. It\\'s a huge milestone. I wanted to follow up with a question on some of your comments regarding data center partners because as I look back over the last 5 years, I just don\\'t see any precedent for the momentum that you have in the marketplace right now between your server partners, white box partners, hyperscale partners that are deploying it, hosted, et cetera. And so my question is relative to the doubling that we\\'ve seen year-on-year in each of the last 2 years, what does that partner expansion mean for data center\\'s growth? And then if I could sneak one more in. 2 new products just announced in the gaming platform, 1070 Ti and a Collector\\'s Edition on TITAN Xp. What do those mean for the gaming platform?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, Craig, thanks a lot. Let\\'s see. We have never created a product that is as broadly supported by the industries and has grown 9 consecutive quarters, it has doubled year-over-year and with partnerships of the scale that we\\'re looking at. We have just never created a product like that before, and I think the reason for that is several folds. The first is that it is true that CPU scaling has come to an end. That\\'s just laws of physics. The end of Moore\\'s Law is just laws of physics. And yet the world for software development and the world -- the problems that computing can help solve is growing faster than any time before. Nobody\\'s ever seen a large-scale planning problem like Amazon before. Nobody\\'s ever seen a large-scale planning problem like Didi before. The number of millions of taxi rides per week is just staggering. And so nobody\\'s ever seen large problems like these before, large-scale problems like these before. And so high-performance computing and accelerated computing using GPUs has become recognized as the path forward. And so I think that that\\'s at the highest level of the most important parameter. Second is artificial intelligence and its emergence and applications to solving problems that we historically thought were unsolvable. Solving the unsolvable problems is a real realization. I mean, this is happening across just about every industry we know, whether it\\'s Internet service providers to health care to manufacturing to transportation and logistics, you just name it, financial services. And so I think artificial intelligence is a real tool, deep learning is a real tool that can help solve some of the world\\'s unsolvable problems. And I think that our dedication to high-performance computing and this one singular architecture, our 7-year head start, if you will, in deep learning and our early recognition of the importance of this new computing approach, both the timing of it, the fact that it was naturally a perfect fit for the skills that we have and then the incredibly -- the incredible effectiveness of this approach, I think, has really created the perfect conditions for our architecture. And so I think -- I really appreciate you noticing that, but this is definitely the most successful product line in the history of our company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI have a question on the automotive market and the outlook there. And interestingly, with the other segments growing as quickly as they are, auto is becoming a smaller percentage of revenue now. And certainly, the design traction seems very positive. Can you talk about the ramp in terms of when the auto revenue, when we could see that as getting back to a similar percentage of revenue? Is that growing more quickly? Do you think that is likely to happen over the next year with some of these design wins coming out? Or is that something we should -- we\\'ll be waiting for over several years?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI appreciate that, Chris. So the way to think about that is as you know, we\\'ve really, really reduced our emphasis on infotainment even though that\\'s the primary part of our revenues, so that we could take, literally, hundreds of engineers and including the processors that we\\'re building now, a couple of 2,000, 3,000 engineers, working on our autonomous machine and artificial intelligence platform for this marketplace to take advantage of the position we have and to go after this amazing revolution that\\'s about to happen. I happen to believe that everything that moves will be autonomous someday, and it could be a bus, a truck, a shuttle, a car. Everything that moves will be autonomous someday. It could be a delivery vehicle. It could be little robots that are moving around warehouses. It could be delivering a pizza to you. And we felt that those -- this was such an incredibly, incredibly great challenge and such a great computing problem that we decided to dedicate ourselves to it. Over the next several years, and if you look at our DRIVE PX platform today, there\\'s over 200 companies that are working on it. 125 start-ups are working on it. And these companies are mapping companies. They\\'re Tier 1s. They\\'re OEMs. They\\'re shuttle companies, car companies, trucking companies, taxi companies. And this last quarter, we announced an extension of our DRIVE PX platform to include DRIVE PX Pegasus, which is now the world\\'s first auto-grade, full ASIL D platform for robotaxis. And so I think our position is really excellent, and the investment has proven to be one of the best ever. And so I think in terms of revenues, my expectation is that this coming year, we\\'ll enjoy revenues as a result of the supercomputers that customers will have to buy for training their networks, for simulating the -- all these autonomous vehicles driving and developing their self-driving cars. And we\\'ll see fairly large quantities of development systems being sold this coming year. The year after that, I think, is the year when you\\'re going to see the robotaxis ramping, and our economics in every robotaxi is several thousand dollars. And then starting, I would say, late 2020 to 2021, you\\'re going to start to see the first fully automatic autonomous cars, what people call Level 4 cars, starting to hit the road. And so that\\'s kind of how I see it. Just next year is simulation environments, development systems, supercomputers, and then the year after that is robotaxis and then a year or 2 after that will be all the self-driving cars.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI have, I guess, a 2-part question on gross margin. Colette, I remember, I don\\'t know, maybe 3 years ago, 3.5 years ago at an analyst day, you guys were talking about gross margins in the mid-50s and that was inclusive of the Intel payment. And now you\\'re hitting numbers at 60% excluding that. I want -- if you could talk a little bit about how mix of the data center business and some others drives gross margin going forward. And maybe, Jensen, you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned Volta being such a huge chip in terms of transistor count. How you\\'re thinking about taking costs out of that product as you ramp it into gaming next year and the effects on gross margin.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thanks, Matt, for the question. Yes, we\\'ve been on a steady stream of increasing the gross margins over the years. But this is the evolution of the entire model, the model of the value-added platforms that we sell and inclusive of the entire ecosystem of work that we do, the software that we enable in so many of these platforms that we bring to market. Data center is one of them. Our ProVis, another one and if you think about all of our work that we have in terms of gaming and that overall expansion of the ecosystem. So this has been continuing to increase our gross margin. Mix is more of a statement in terms of each quarter we have a different mix in terms of our products. So some of them have a little bit of seasonality. And depending on when some of those platforms come to market, we can have a mix change within some of those subsets. It\\'s still going to be our focus as we go forward in terms of growing gross margins as best as we can, you can see in terms of our guidance into Q4, which we feel comfortable with that guidance that we will increase it as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, with respect to yield enhancement, the way to think about that is we do it in several ways. The first thing is I\\'m just incredibly proud of the technology group that we have in VLSI, and they get us ready for these brand new nodes, whether it\\'s in the process readiness with all the circuit readiness, the packaging, the memory readiness. The readiness is so incredible -- incredibly important for us because these processors that we\\'re creating are really, really hard. They\\'re the largest things in the world. And so we get one shot at it. And so the team does everything they can to essentially prepare us. And by the time that we tape-out a product for real, we know for certain that we can build it. And so the technology team in our company is just world-class, absolutely world-class. There\\'s nothing like it. Then once we go into production, we have the benefit of ramping up the products. And as yields improve, we\\'ll surely benefit from the cost. But that\\'s not really where the focus is. I mean, in the final analysis, the real focus for us is continue to improve the software stack on top of our processors. And the reason for that is each one of our processors carry with it an enormous amount of memory and systems and networking and the whole data center. Most of our data center products, if we can improve the throughput of a data center by another 50% or, in our case, often times we\\'ll improve something from 2x to 4x, the way to think about that is that billion-dollar data center just improved its productivity by a factor of 2. And all of the software work that we do on top of CUDA and the incredible work that we do with optimizing compilers and graph analytics, all of that stuff then all of a sudden translates to value to our customers, not measured by dollars, but measured by hundreds of millions of dollars. And that\\'s really the leverage of accelerated computing.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen, can you comment on some of the issues this week regarding Intel and their renewed interest in getting into the graphics space and their relationship at the chip level with AMD?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thanks, Hans. Yes, listen, there\\'s a lot of news out there. I guess some of the things I take away, first of all, Raja leaving AMD is a great loss for AMD. And it\\'s a recognition by Intel probably that the GPU is just incredibly, incredibly important now. And the modern GPU is not a graphics accelerator. The modern GPU, we just left the word G in there -- the letter G in there. But these processors are domain-specific parallel accelerators, and they\\'re enormously complex. They\\'re the most complex processors built by anybody on the planet today. And that\\'s the reason why IBM uses our processors for the world\\'s largest supercomputers. That\\'s the reason why every single cloud, every single -- every major cloud, every major server maker in the world has adopted NVIDIA GPUs: It\\'s just incredibly hard to do. The amount of software engineering that goes on top of it is significant as well. And so if you look at the way we do things, we plan a road map about 5 years out. It takes about 3 years to build a new generation, and we build multiple GPUs at the same time. And on top of that, there are some 5,000 engineers working on systems software and numerics libraries and solvers and compilers and graph analytics and cloud platforms and virtualization stacks in order to make this computing architecture useful to all of the people that we serve. And so when you think about it from that perspective, it\\'s just an enormous undertaking; arguably, the most significant undertaking of any processor in the world today. And that\\'s the reason why we\\'re able to speed up applications by a factor of 100. You don\\'t walk in and have a new widget and a few transistors and all of a sudden speed up applications by a factor of 100 or 50 or 20. That\\'s just something that\\'s inconceivable unless you do the type of innovation that we do. And then lastly, with respect to the chip that they built together, I think it goes without saying now that the energy efficiency of Pascal GeForce and the Max-Q design technology and all of the software that we created has really set a new design point for the industry. It is now possible to build a state-of-the-art gaming notebook with the most leading-edge GeForce processors and be able to deliver gaming experiences that are many times greater than a console in 4K and have that be in a laptop that\\'s 18 millimeters thin. The combination of Pascal and Max-Q has really raised the bar, and I think that that\\'s really the essence of it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nUnfortunately, we have run out of time. Presenters, I\\'ll now turn the call over to you for closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWe had another great quarter. Gaming is one of the fastest-growing entertainment industries, and we are well positioned for the holidays. AI is becoming increasingly widespread in many industries throughout the world, and we\\'re hoping to lead the way with all major cloud providers and computer makers moving to deploy Volta. And we\\'re building the future of autonomous driving. We expect robotaxis, using our technology, to hit the road in just a couple of years. We look forward to seeing many of you at SC17 next week, and thank you for joining us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis concludes today\\'s conference call.

(Operator Instructions)\\\\nI\\'ll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski from Investor Relations to begin your conference.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSimona Jankowski,  NVIDIA Corporation - VP of IR    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA\\'s Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2020. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\\\\nI\\'d like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA\\'s Investor Relations website.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Simona. Q2 revenue was $2.58 billion, in line with our outlook, down 17% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially.\\\\nStarting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.31 billion was down 27% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially. We are pleased with the strong sequential growth in the quarter when we launched our RTX SUPER lineup for desktop gamers, wrapped up our greatest ever number of gaming laptops and launched our new RTX studio laptops for creators. In July, we unveiled 3 GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, delivering the best-in-class gaming performance and power efficiency and real-time ray tracing for both current and next-generation games. These GPUs delivered a performance boost of up to 24% from our initial Turing GPUs launched a year earlier. The SUPER lineup strengthens our leadership in the high end of the market, and the response has been great. We look forward to delighting gamers with the best performance in ray tracing as we get into the back to school and holiday shopping seasons.\\\\nRay tracing is taking the gaming industry by storm and have quickly come to define the modern era of computer graphics. A growing number of blockbuster AAA titles have announced support for NVIDIA RTX ray tracing, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Super Punk 2077 (sic) [Cyberpunk 2077], Watch Dogs: Legion and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. Excitement around these titles is tremendous. GameSpot called Cyberpunk one of the most anticipated games of the decade. NVIDIA GeForce RTX are the only graphic cards in the market with hardware support for ray tracing. They deliver a 2 to 3x performance speed up over GPUs without a dedicated ray tracing core.\\\\nThe laptop business continues to be a standout growth driver as OEMs are ramping a record 100-plus gaming laptop models ahead of the back to school and holiday season. The combination of our energy-efficient Turing architecture and Max-Q technology enables beautifully crafted thin and light form factors that can deliver the performance of high-end gaming desktop or our next-generation console.\\\\nAt Computex in May, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX Studio laptops, a new design artist platform that extends our reach to the large, underserved market of creators. In the age of YouTube, creators and freelancers are rapidly growing population, but they have traditionally not had access to professional-grade workstations through online and retail channels. RTX Studio laptops are designed to meet their increasing complex workflows such as photorealistic ray tracing, AI image enhancement and ultra high-resolution video. Powered by our RTX GPUs and optimized software, RTX Studio laptops deliver performance that\\'s up to 7x faster than that of the MacBook Pro. A total of 27 RTX Studio models have been announced by major OEMs.\\\\nSequential growth also benefited from the production ramp of the 2 new models of Nintendo Switch gaming console. We are expecting our console business to remain strong in Q3 before the seasonal production slowdown in Q4 when console-related revenue is expected to be fairly minimal, similar to last year.\\\\nMoving to data center. Revenue was $655 million, down 14% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially. In the vertical industries portion of the business, expanding AI workload drove sequential and year-over-year growth. In hyperscale portion, we continue to be impacted by relatively weak overall spending at a handful of CPU -- CSPs. Sales of NVIDIA GPUs for use in the cloud were solid. While sales of internal hyperscale use were muted, the engineering focus on AI is growing.\\\\nLet me give some color on each of these areas. We are building a broad base of customers across multiple industries as they adopt NVIDIA\\'s platforms to harness the power of AI. Public sectors, higher education and financial services were among the key verticals driving growth this quarter. In addition, we won Lighthouse account deals in important industries that are on the cusp of being transformed by AI. For example, in retail, Walmart is using NVIDIA GPUs to run some of its product demand forecasting models, slashing the time to do so in just 4 hours from several weeks on CPUs. By accelerating its data science workflow, Walmart can improve its algorithms, reduce development cycles and test new features.\\\\nEarlier this week, we announced breakthroughs for the fastest training and inference of the state-of-the-art model for natural language process understanding called BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations of -- from Transformers, a breakthrough AI language model that achieves a deeper sense of language, context and meaning. This can enable mere human comprehension in real-time by chat box, intelligent personal assistants and search engines. We are working with Microsoft as an early adopter of these advances.\\\\nAI computing leadership is a high priority for NVIDIA. Last month, we set records for training deep learning neural network models on the latest MLPerf benchmarks, particularly in the most demanding areas. In just 7 months, we have achieved up to 80% speed-ups enabled by new algorithms and software optimizations across the full stack while using the same hardware. This is a direct result of the productive programming environment and flexibility of CUDA.\\\\nDelivering AI at scale isn\\'t just about silicon. It\\'s about optimizing across the entire high-performance computing system. In fact, the NVIDIA AI platform is getting progressively faster. Every month, we publish new optimization and performance improvements to CUDA-X AI libraries, supporting every AI framework and development environment. All in, our ecosystem of developers is now 1.4 million strong.\\\\nIn setting these MLPerf records, we leveraged our new DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer, demonstrating that leadership in AI research demands leadership in computing infrastructure. This system debuted in June at #22 on the TOP500 list of the world\\'s fastest supercomputers at the annual International Supercomputing Conference. Used to meet the massive demand for autonomous vehicle development program, it is powered by more than 1,500 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs linked with Mellanox interconnects. We\\'ve made DGX SuperPOD available commercially to customers, essentially providing them with the turnkey supercomputer that they can assemble in weeks rather than months. It is roughly 400x smaller in size than other similarly performing TOP500 systems, which are built from thousands of servers.\\\\nAlso at the conference, we announced that by next year\\'s end, we will make available to the ARM ecosystem NVIDIA\\'s full stack of AI and HPC software, which accelerates more than 600 HPC applications and all AI frameworks. With this announcement, NVIDIA will accelerate all major CPU architectures, including x86, POWER and ARM.\\\\nLastly, regarding our pending acquisition of Mellanox, we have received regulatory approval in the U.S. and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China. The approval process is progressing as expected, and we continue to work toward closing the deal by the end of this calendar year.\\\\nMoving to pro visualization. Revenue reached $291 million, up 4% from our prior year and up 9% sequentially. Year-on-year and sequential growth was led by record revenue for mobile workstations with strong demand for new thin and light form factors. We had a great showing at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry\\'s biggest annual conference held in Los Angeles. Our researchers won several Best in Show awards. In just a year since the launch of RTX ray tracing, over 40 design and creative applications with RTX technology had been announced by leading software vendors, including Adobe, Autodesk and Dassault systems and many others. NVIDIA RTX technology has reinvigorated the computer graphics industry by enabling researchers and developers to take a leap in photorealistic rendering, augmented reality and virtual reality.\\\\nFinally, turning to automotive. Q2 revenue was $209 million, up 30% from a year ago and up 26% sequentially. This reflects growing adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development projects, including 1 particularly sizable development services transaction that was recognized in the quarter. In addition, in June, we announced a new partnership with the Volvo Group to develop AI and autonomous trucks utilizing NVIDIA\\'s end-to-end AI platform for training, simulation and in-vehicle computing. The strategic partnership will enable Volvo Group to develop a wide range of autonomous driving solutions for freight transport, recycling collection, public transport, construction, mining, forestry and more. This collaboration is a great validation of our long-held position that every vehicle, not just cars but also trucks, shuttles, business, taxis and many others, will have autonomous capability 1 day.\\\\nAutonomous features can bring enormous value to the trucking industry, in particular as the demand of online shopping put ever greater stress on the world\\'s transport systems. Expectations for overnight or same-day deliveries create challenges that can only be met by autonomous trucks, which can operate 24 hours a day. To help address these needs, NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to large-scale simulation to in-car computing. Multiple customers from OEMs like Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Volvo to Tier 1s like Bosch, Continental and ZF are already onboard. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025.\\\\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margins was 59.8% and non-GAAP was 60.1%, up sequentially, reflecting higher automotive development services, a favorable mix in gaming and lower component cost. GAAP operating expenses were $970 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $749 million, up 19% and 8% year-on-year, respectively. We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020 while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP EPS was $0.90, down 49% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.24, down 36% from a year ago.\\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $980 million and $765 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million to $120 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.\\\\nIn closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Jefferies conference, hardware and communications infrastructure summit, on August 27 and at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 25.\\\\nWith that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for the questions?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess first question on gaming, how should we think about your outlook into the October quarter vis-\\\\u00e0-vis kind of normal seasonality? How are you thinking about Switch within that? And considering now that you have full Turing lineup as well as content truly coming to the forefront here, how do you think about trends beyond the October quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Colette, why don\\'t you take the Switch question? And then I\\'ll take the rest of the RTX questions.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. From a gaming perspective, the overall Switch or the overall console business definitely is a seasonal business. We usually expect to see production ramping in Q2 and in Q3, with it coming down likely in Q4. So you should see Switch to be a portion definitely of our gaming business in Q3.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. C.J., thanks for the question. RTX, as you know, is -- first of all, RTX is doing great. I think we\\'ve put all the pieces in place to bring ray tracing into the future of games. The number of games, the blockbuster games that adopted RTX is really snowballing. We announced several -- 6 games in the last couple of months. There\\'s going to be some exciting announcements next week at gamescom. It\\'s pretty clear now the future of gaming will include ray tracing. The number of software developers that create -- with creative tools that adopted RTX is really quite spectacular. We now have 40 -- over 40 ISV tools that was announced at SIGGRAPH that have accelerated ray tracing and video editing. And some of the applications\\' amazing AI capabilities for image optimization enhancement support RTX. And so looking forward, this is what I expect. I expect that ray tracing is going to drive a reinvigoration of gaming graphics. I expect that the over 100 laptops that we have RTX designed -- RTX GPUs designed into is going to contribute our growth. Notebook gaming is  one of the fastest-growing segments of the gaming platform world. The number of notebooks that are able to game is only a few percent, so it\\'s extremely underexposed. And yet, we know that gamers are -- like the rest of us, they like thin and light notebooks, but they like it to be able to run powerful games. And so this is an area that has grown significantly for us year-over-year, and we\\'re expecting it to grow through the end of the -- through the second half and through next year.\\\\nAnd one of the things that\\'s really exciting is our RTX Studio line that we introduced recently. We observed, and through our discussions with the PC industry, that the creatives are really underexposed and underserved by the latest technologies. And they want notebooks and they want PCs that have powerful graphics. They use it for 3D content creation and high definition video editing and image optimization and things like that. And we introduced a brand-new line of computers that we call RTX Studio. Now the OEMs were so excited about it. And at SIGGRAPH, we now have 27 different laptops shipping and more coming. And so I think RTX is really geared for growth. We have great games coming. We got the SUPER line of GPUs. We have all of our notebooks that were designed into that we\\'re ramping and, of course, the new RTX Studio line. And so I expect this to be a growth market for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Very helpful. If I could follow up on the data center side, perhaps you can speak directly just to the hyperscale side, both internal and cloud, and whether you\\'re seeing any green shoots, any signs of life there and how you\\'re thinking about what that rate of recovery could look like over time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          With the exception of a couple of hyperscalers, C.J., I would -- we\\'re seeing broad-based growth in data centers. In the area of training, the thing that\\'s really exciting everybody, and everybody is racing towards, is training these large gigantic natural language understanding models, language models. The transformer model that was introduced by Google, called BERT, has since been enhanced into XLned and RoBERTa and, gosh, so many different, GP2, and Microsoft\\'s MASS. And there\\'s so many different versions of these language models. And in the AI, NLU, natural language understanding, is one of the most important areas that everybody\\'s racing to go to. And so these models are really, really large. It\\'s over 1,000x larger than image models that we\\'re training just a few years ago, and they\\'re just gigantic models. It\\'s one of the reasons why we built the DGX SuperPOD so that we could train these gigantic models in a reasonable amount of time. The second area -- so that\\'s training in the hyperscalers.\\\\nThe second area where we\\'re seeing enormous amounts of activity has to do with trying to put these conversational AI models into services so that they could be interactive and in real time. Whereas photo tagging and photo enhancement is something that you could put off-line and you could do that while you have excess capacity when it\\'s off of the most busy time of the day. You can\\'t do that with language and conversational AI. You better to respond to the person in real time. And so the performance that\\'s required is significant. But more importantly, the number of models necessary for conversational AI from speech recognition to language understanding to recommendation systems to text-to-speech to wave synthesis, these 5, 6, 7 models have to be processed in real time -- in series and in real time so that you can have a reasonable conversation with the AI agent.\\\\nAnd so these type of activities is really driving interest and activity at all of the hyperscalers. My expectation is that this is going to continue to be a big growth opportunity for us. But more importantly, in addition to that, we\\'re seeing that AI is -- the wave of AI is going from the cloud to the enterprise to the edge and all the way out to the autonomous systems. The place where we\\'re seeing a lot of excitement, and we talked about that in the past and we\\'re seeing growth there, has to do with the vertical industry enterprises that are starting to adopt AI to create new products, whether it\\'s a delivery robot or some kind of a chat bot or the ability to detect fraud in financial services, these applications in vertical industries are really spreading all over the place. There\\'s some over 4,000 AI start-ups around the world. And the way that we engage them is they use our platform to start developing AI in the cloud. And as you know, we\\'re the only AI platform that\\'s available on-prem and in every single cloud. And so they can use our AI platforms for -- in all the clouds, which is driving our cloud computing, external cloud computing growth. And then they can also use it on-prem if their usage really grows significantly. And that\\'s one of the reasons why our Tesla for OEMs and DGX is growing. And so we\\'re seeing broad-based excitement around AI as they use it for their products and new services. And these 4,000, 4,500 start-ups around the world is really driving consumption of that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I actually had 2 as well, one quick one for Colette and one for Jensen. Colette, good to see the gross margin recovery getting into October. Is this 62% to 63% range a more sustainable level and perhaps a level you could grow off of as sales get more normalized levels? And then a bigger question is for Jensen. Again, on the data center side, Jensen, when I look back between -- 2015 to 2018, your data center business essentially grew 10x. And then the last year has been a tough one with the slowdown in cloud CapEx and so forth. When do you think your data center starts to grow back on a year-to-year -- on a year-on-year basis? Can that happen sometime -- later this year? And then just longer term, what is the right way to think about this business? Does it go back to prior levels? Does it go at a different phase? This is the one part of the business that I think is toughest for us to model, so any color would be very helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. So let me start first with your question, Vivek, regarding gross margins. Yes, thanks for recognizing that we are moving towards our expectations that, over time, we\\'ll continue to see our overall volumes improve. Essentially, our business is normalized. We\\'ve reached normalized levels through the last couple of quarters. And this quarter, just very similar to what we will see going forward, is mix is the largest driver, what drives our overall gross margins and our gross margin improvements.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Vivek, if you look at the last several years, there\\'s no question our data center business has grown a lot. And my expectation is that it\\'s going to grow a lot more, and let me explain to you why. Aside from a couple -- a few of uncontrollable circumstances and the exception of a couple of large customers, the overall trend, the broad-based trend, of our data center business is upward, to the right. And it is growing very nicely. There\\'s a couple of different dynamics that\\'s causing that on first principles to grow. And of course, one of them is as AI is well known now to require accelerated computing, our computing architecture is really ideal for it. AI is not just one network. It\\'s thousands of different types of networks, and these networks are getting more and more complex over time, the amount of data you have to process is enormous. And so like all software programs, you can\\'t predict exactly how the software is going to get programmed. And having a programmable architecture like CUDA and yet optimized for AI like Tensor Cores that we\\'ve created is really the ideal architecture. \\\\nWe know also that AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. The ability for machines to learn and write software by itself and write software that no humans can write is pretty extraordinary. And the applications of AI, as you guys are watching yourself, are just spreading in every single industry. And so the way we think about AI is in waves, if you will. The first wave of AI is developing the computer architecture, and that was the first part where -- that\\'s when a lot of people discovered who we are, and we emerged into the world of high-performance computing in AI. The second wave is applying the AI for cloud service providers or hyperscalers. They have a large amount of data. They have a lot of consumer applications. Many of them are not life-critical and so, therefore, the application of an early technology -- early-adoption technology was really viable. And so you saw hyperscalers adopt AI. And the thing that\\'s really exciting for us is beyond recommendations, beyond image enhancement, the area where we believe the most important application for AI is likely conversational AI. Most people talking and asking questions and talking to their mobile devices and looking for something or asking for directions. Instead of having a page of -- a list of options, it responds with an answer that is very likely a good one.\\\\nThe next phase of AI is what we call vertical industry enterprise AI. And this is where companies are using it not just to accelerate the business process internally, but they\\'re using AI to create new products and services. They could be new medical instruments to IoT-based medical instruments to monitor your health. It could be something related to an application that -- used for financial services for forecasting or for fraud detection. It could be some kind of device that delivers pizza to you, delivery bots. And the combination of IoT and artificial intelligence, for the very first time, you actually have the software capabilities to make use of all of these sensors that you\\'re putting all over the world. And that\\'s the next phase of growth. And it affects companies from large industrials, transportation companies, retailers, you name it. Health care companies, you name it. And so that phase of growth of AI is the phase that we\\'re about to enter into.\\\\nAnd then the longer term is an industry that we all know to be extremely large, but it takes time because it\\'s life-critical, and it has to do with transportation. It\\'s a $100 trillion industry. We know it\\'s going to be automated. We know that everything that moves in the future will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. And that\\'s just a matter of time before we realize its full potential.\\\\nAnd so the net of it all is that I believe that AI is the single most powerful technology force of our time, and that\\'s why we\\'re all in on it. And we know that acceleration and accelerated computing is the perfect model for that. And it started in the cloud, but it\\'s going to keep moving out into the edge and through data centers and enterprises and hopefully -- well, eventually, all the way out into autonomous devices and machines in the real world. And so this is a big market, and I\\'m super enthusiastic about it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had 2 as well, one for Jensen and the other for Colette. Jensen, you guys called out inference as a significant contributor to growth in data center last quarter. I think you guys talked about it being a double-digit percentage contributor, curious what you saw from inference in the quarter. And more importantly, if you can talk about the outlook, both near term and long term, as it relates to inference, that\\'ll be helpful. And then secondly, for Colette, just want to double click on the gross margin question. The sequential improvement that you\\'re guiding to is a pretty significant number. So I was just hoping if you can kind of break it down for us in terms of overall volume growth mix dynamics, both between segments and within segments and also to the extent DRAM pricing is impacting that, any color on that will be helpful as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Toshiya, I got to tell you, I\\'m less good at normal pre -- near-term productions than I am good at thinking about long-term dynamics. But let me talk to you about inference. Our inference business is -- remains robust. It\\'s double digits. It\\'s a large part of our business. And -- but more importantly, the 2 dynamics that I think are near term and that\\'s going to drive growth, number one is interactive conversational AI, interactive conversational AI inference.\\\\nIf you simply ask a chat bot a simple question, where is the closest pizza and you would -- pizza shop, and you would like to have a conversation with this bot, it would have to do speech recognition, it has to understand what it is that you asked about, it has to look it up in a recommender based on the locations you\\'re at, maybe your preferences of styles of pizza and the price ranges that you\\'re interested and how far you\\'re willing to go, to go get it. It has to recommend a pizza shop for you to go to. It has to then translate that from text-to-speech and then into human -- a human understand a voice.\\\\nAnd those models have to happen in just a few -- ideally, a few hundred milliseconds. Currently, it\\'s not that. And it makes it really hard for these services to be deployed quite broadly and used for all kinds of different applications. And so that\\'s the near-term opportunity, it\\'s interactive conversational AI inference. And you could just imagine every single hyperscaler racing to go make this possible because recently, we had some important breakthroughs in machine learning language models. The BERT model that I mentioned earlier is really, really an important development, and it\\'s caused a large number of derivatives that has improved upon it. And so near-term conversational AI inference.\\\\nWe\\'re also seeing near term the inference at the edge. There are many types of applications where because of the laws of physics reasons, the speed of light reasons or the economics reasons or data sovereignty reasons, it\\'s not possible to stream the data to the cloud and have the inference done at the cloud. You have to do that at the edge. You need the latency to be low, the amount of data that you\\'re streaming is continuous. And so you don\\'t want to be paying for that line rate the whole time, and maybe the data is of great confidentiality or privacy. And so we\\'re seeing a lot of excitement and a lot of development for edge AI. Smart retail, smart warehouses, smart factories, smart cities, smart airports, you just make a list of those kind of things, basically locations where there is a lot of activity, where safety or cost or large amount of materials is passing through, you could just imagine the applications. All of those really want to be edge computing systems and edge inference systems. And so those are near term -- 2 near-term drivers, and I think it\\'s fair to say that both of them are quite large opportunities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So to answer your question regarding gross margin in a little bit more detail, probably our largest area that we expect improvement in terms of our mix is our mix return regarding our overall gaming business. We expect to have a full quarter of our SUPER lineup within the next quarter, including our RTX as well as our notebook becoming a bigger mix as well as it grows. These drivers are one of the largest reasons why we see that growth in our gross margin. We always think about our component cost, our overall cost of manufacturing, so this is always baked in over time, but we\\'ll continue to see improvements on that as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Again, your data center business, many of your peers on the compute and storage side are seeing spending recovery by cloud and hyperscalers in the second half of this year after a similar weak first half of the year. You guys saw some growth in Q2 driven primarily by enterprise. It seems like you had some broadening out of the customer spending this quarter. Inferencing continues to see strong momentum. Would you guys expect that this translates into a double-digit percentage sequential growth in data center in Q3 off of the low base in Q2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our hyperscale data center with a few customers don\\'t give us very much -- we don\\'t get very much visibility from a handful of customers in hyperscale. However, we\\'re seeing broad-based growth and excitement in data centers. And the way to think about data center, our data center business consists of hyperscale training, internal training, hyperscale inference, cloud computing -- and that\\'s hyperscale, and that cloud is a public cloud. And then we have vertical industry enterprise, what sometimes we call enterprise, vertical industry enterprise, it could be transportation companies, retailers, telcos, vertical industry adoption of AI either to accelerate their business or to develop new products and services.\\\\nAnd then the -- so when you look at our data center from that perspective and these pieces, although we don\\'t see as much -- we don\\'t get as much visibility as we like in a couple of the large customers, the rest of the hyperscalers, we\\'re seeing broad-based growth. And so we\\'re experiencing the enthusiasm and the energy that maybe the others are. And so we\\'ll keep reporting -- updating you guys as we go. We\\'ll see how it goes.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had 2. I guess first for Jensen, Volta\\'s been around now for about 2 years. Do you see signs of demand maybe building up ahead of the new set of nanometer products, whenever that comes out? I guess I\\'m just wondering whether there\\'s some element of this is more around product cadence that gets resolved as you do roll out the product. That\\'s the first question.\\\\nAnd then I guess, the second question, Colette, is of the $300 million growth into October, it sounds like Switch is pretty flat, but I\\'m wondering if you can give us maybe some qualitative sense of where the growth is coming from, is it maybe like 2/3 gaming and 1/3 data centers, something like that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, Volta -- data center products can churn that fast. We -- gamers could churn products quickly because they\\'re bought and sold one at a time. But data centers -- data center infrastructure really has to be planned properly, and the build-out takes time. And we expect Volta to be successful all the way through next year. And software still continues to be improved on it. We\\'re still improving systems on it. And in fact, just 1 year -- in just 1 year, we improved our AI performance on Volta by almost 2x, 80%. And so you could just imagine the amount of software that\\'s built on top of Volta and all the Tensor Cores and all the GPUs connected with NVLink and the large number of nodes that are connected to build supercomputers.\\\\nThe software of building these systems, large-scale systems, is really, really hard. And that\\'s one of the reasons why you hear people talk about chips, but they never show up because building the software is just an enormous undertaking. The number of software engineers we have in the company is in the thousands, and we have the benefit of having built on top of this architecture for over 1.5 decades. And so when we\\'re able to deploy into data centers as quickly as we do, I think we kind of lose sight of how hard it is to do that in the first place. The last time a new processor entered into a data center was an x86 Xeon, and you just don\\'t bring processors in the data centers that frequently or that easily. And so I think the way to think about Volta is that it\\'s surely in its prime, and it\\'s going to keep -- continue to do well all the way through next year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          In regard to our guidance on revenue, and we do guide in terms of the total. You have seen, in this last quarter, we executed a sequential increase really focusing on moving to a normalization of our gaming business. And we\\'re now approaching the second half of the year getting ready for the back to school and the holidays. So you should expect also our gaming business to continue to grow to reach that full normalization by the end of Q3. We do expect the rest of our platforms to likely also grow. We have a couple different models on how that will come out. But yes, we do expect our data center business to grow, and then we\\'ll see on the rest of our businesses as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          A couple of questions. I guess the first one is, Jensen, if you have any, I guess, high-level qualitative commentary on how the new SUPER upgrades of your Turing platform have been received in the market and how you might think about them progressing through the year. And then, I guess, the second question is a bigger one. Intel\\'s talked quite openly about One API. The software stack at Xilinx is progressing with Versal ACAP. I mean you guys get a lot of credit for the decade of work that you\\'ve done on CUDA. But I wonder if you might comment on if you\\'ve seen any movement in the competitive landscape on the software side for the data center space.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          SUPER is off to a great start. Goodness, SUPER is off to a super start. And if you look at -- if you do channel checks all over, even though we\\'ve got a lot of products in the channel and we -- last quarter was a transitional quarter for us actually. And we didn\\'t -- we shipped SUPER later in the quarter. But because the entire ecosystem and all of our execution engines are so primed, we were able to ship a fair number through the channel. And so -- and yet, if you do spot checks all around the world, they\\'re sold out almost everywhere. And the pricing in the spot market is drifting higher than MSRP. That just tells you something about demand. And so that\\'s really exciting. SUPER is off to a super start for -- and at this point, it\\'s a foregone conclusion that we\\'re going to buy a new graphics card, and it\\'s going to the last 2, 3, 4 years to not have ray tracing is just crazy. Ray tracing content just keeps coming out. And between the performance of SUPER and the fact that it has ray tracing hardware, it\\'s going to be super well positioned for -- throughout all of next year.\\\\nYour question about APIs and software programmability. APIs is just one of the issues. The large issue about processors is how do you program it. The reason why x86s and CPUs are so popular is because they solve the great challenge of software developers: how to program a computer. And how to program a computer and how to compile for that computer is a paramount concern to computer science, and it\\'s an area of tremendous research. Going from single CPU to multi-core CPUs was a great challenge. Going from multi-core CPUs to multi-node multi-core CPUs is an enormous challenge. And yet, when we created CUDA in our GPUs, we went from 1 CPU core or one processor core to a few to now, in the case of large-scale systems, millions of processor cores. And how do you program such a computer across multi-GPU, multi-node? It\\'s a concept that\\'s not easy to grasp. And so I don\\'t really know how one programming approach or a simple API is going to make 7 different type of weird things work together. And I can\\'t make it fit in my head. But programming isn\\'t as simple as a PowerPoint slide, I guess. And I think it\\'s just -- time will tell whether one programming approach could fit 7 different types of processors when no time in history has it ever happened.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wonder if you could talk about the strength in the automotive business. Looks like the services piece of that is getting to be bigger. What\\'s the outlook for that part of the business? And can you give us a sense of the mix between services and components at this point?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thanks, Joe. Our approach to autonomous vehicles comes in basically 2 parts. The first part is a full stack, which is building the architected processor, the system, the system software and all of the driving applications on top, including the deep neural nets. The second part of it, we call that a full stack self-driving car computer. The second part of DRIVE includes an end-to-end AV development system. For those who would like to use our processors, use our system software but create their own applications, we created a system that allows -- basically shares with them our computing infrastructure that we built for ourselves that allows them to do end-to-end development from deep learning development to the application of AV to simulating that application to doing regression testing of that application before they deploy it into a car. And the 2 systems that we use there is called DGX for training and Constellation for simulation and what is called Replay.\\\\nAnd then the third part of our business model is development agreements, otherwise known as NRE. These 3 elements, full stack computer, end-to-end development flow and NRE project development -- product development consists of the overall DRIVE business. And so although the cars will take several years to go into production, we\\'re seeing a lot of interest in working with us to develop self-driving cars using our development systems and entering into development projects. And so we\\'re -- the number of autonomous vehicle projects is quite large around the world as you can imagine. And so my sense is that we\\'re going to continue to do well here. The additional part of autonomous vehicles and where the capability has been derived and is going to seal up more near-term opportunities has to do with things like delivery shuttles, self-driving shuttles and maybe cargo movers inside walled warehouses. Those kind of autonomous machines require basically the same technology, but it\\'s sooner and easier to deploy. And so we are seeing a lot of excitement around that area.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the improved performance. At your Analyst Day back a couple of months ago, you had highlighted the installed base opportunity for RTX. And I think at that point in time, you talked about 50% being Pascal base, 48% being pre-Pascal. You also alluded to the fact that you were seeing a positive mix shift higher in terms of the price points of this RTX cycle. So I\\'m curious, where do we stand on the current product cycle? And what are you seeing currently as we go through this product cycle on the Turing platforms?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We launched -- well, first of all, the answer is that RTX adoption is faster than Pascal\\'s adoption if you normalize to time 0 of launch. The reason for that is Pascal launched top to bottom on the same day. And as you guys know, we weren\\'t able to do that for Turing. But if we did that for Turing, the adoption rate is actually faster. And to me, it\\'s a rather sensible. And the reason for that is because Pascal was basically DX12. And Maxwell was DX12. And Turing is the world\\'s first DXR, the first ray tracing GPU, brand-new functionality, brand-new API and a lot more performance. And so I think it\\'s sensible that Turing\\'s adoption is going to be rapid.\\\\nThe second element of Turing is something that we\\'ve never talked about before. We\\'re mentioning it more and more because it\\'s such an exciting book market for us is notebooks. The install base of Pascal has a very, very little notebook in it. And the reason for that is because, in the past, we were never able to put a high performance gaming GPU into a thin and light notebook until we invented Max-Q. And in combination with our energy efficiency, we were able to -- we\\'re now able to put a 2080 into a laptop, and it\\'s still beautiful. And so this is effectively a brand-new growth market for us. And with so few people and so few gamers in the world that are able to game on a laptop, I think this is going to be a nice growth market for us.\\\\nAnd then the new market that we introduced and launched this last quarter is called RTX Studio. And this is an underserved segment of the market where consumers, enthusiasts, they could be artists that are working on small firms, they need powerful computers to do their work. They need powerful computers to do rendering and high-definition video editing. And yet it\\'s underserved by workstations because workstations are really sold on a B2B basis into large enterprises. And so we aligned all of the OEMs and created a whole new line of notebooks called RTX Studio. And the enthusiasm has been great. We\\'ve launched 27 different laptops, and I\\'m looking forward to seeing the results of that. This is tens of millions of people who are creators. Some of them professionals, some of them hobbyists. And they use Adobe suites, they use Autodesk in their suites and some of them use SolidWorks and some of them use all kinds of renders, like blender. And these are 3D artists and video artists, and this digital content creation is the modern way of creativity. And so this is an underserved market that we\\'re excited to go serve with RTX Studio.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your last question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have 2 for Colette. My first question is on data center. So I know you say that you have a broad-based growth except for a few hyperscalers. But you only grew at 3% sequentially, about $20 million. That doesn\\'t sound like broad-based growth to me unless like -- did the hyperscalers get worse? Or are they just still so much bigger than like the rest of it? I guess, what\\'s going on in data center? How do I wrap my head around like broad-based growth with relatively minimal growth observed?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So to answer your question here, Stacy, on what we refer to when we\\'re discussing the broad-based growth is the substantial expansion that we have on the types of customers and the industries that we are now approaching. As you know, even a year ago, we had a very, very small base in terms of industry-based hyper -- excuse me, industry-based AI workloads that they were using. Over this last quarter, we\\'re continuing to see strong growth as we roll out all different types of AI solutions, both across the U.S. and worldwide, to these overall customers. Our hyperscalers, again, a couple of them, not necessarily growing. Some of them are flat and some of them are growing depending on whether or not that\\'s for cloud instances or whether or not they\\'re using it for internal use. So we believe that our continued growth with the industries is important for us for the long term to expand the use of AI, and we\\'re just really pleased with what we\\'re seeing in that growth this quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'ll now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, everyone. We\\'re happy with our results this quarter and our return to growth across our platforms. Gaming is doing great. It\\'s great to see NVIDIA RTX reinvigorating the industry. GeForce has several growth drivers. Ray traced games continue to gain momentum. A large number of gaming laptops are rolling out, and our new Studio platform is reaching the large underserved community of creators. Outside a few hyperscalers, we\\'re seeing broad-based growth in data centers. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. More and more enterprises are using AI to create new products and services while leveraging AI to drive ultra-efficiency and speed in their business. And with hyperscalers racing to harness recent breakthroughs in conversational AI, we see growing engagements in training as well as interactive conversational inference. RTX, CUDA accelerated computing, AI, autonomous vehicles, the work we\\'re doing is important, impactful and incredibly fun. We\\'re just grateful there is so much of it. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This concludes today\\'s conference call.

Our full-year revenue crossed above $5 billion to a record $5.01 billion, which was up 7% from the previous year. Quarterly growth was broad-based, with expansion across each of our four market platforms -- gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive. \\\\nPacing gains were our GTX gaming platform, our datacenter platform, powered by deep learning, growing adoption and automotive. Viewed from a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GP revenue grew 10% to $1.18 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue was up 40% to $157 million. NVIDIA\\'s strategy remains sharply focused on creating platforms for our key markets. Our progress stems from our success in creating strong products that are targeted at growth markets. In Q4, our four market platforms contributed more than 85% of revenue, up from 78% a year earlier. Our growth platforms collectively increased 23% year over year. \\\\nFirst let\\'s start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue grossed 25% year on year to $810 million, with good momentum carrying forward from the previous quarter. Maxwell-based GeForce GTX processors continue to lead our gaming growth, combined with growing anticipation for VR and the launch of holiday blockbuster games. The GeForce GTX 970 GPU stands as the world\\'s most popular graphics card on the Steam gaming platform. And we continue to get strong traction with our GeForce GTX GPUs that power gaming notebooks. That includes the recently launched GTX 980 for notebooks, which has enabled a new category -- enthusiast-class VR-capable gaming notebooks. \\\\nExcitement is growing around VR gaming, a key theme of last month\\'s Consumer Electronics Show. We unveiled there our GeForce GTX VR Ready program to help gamers choose the best hardware for an immersive VR experience. And Oculus, which has now opened pre-orders for the Rift headsets, has exclusively certified GeForce GTX systems as being ready for VR. \\\\nGeForce sales are driven by the launch of great gaming titles, and that again proved true this past holiday season. Fallout 4 was among the standouts, recording more than $750 million in sales in its first 24 hours. Other major hits were Star Wars Battlefront, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and Rainbow Six. We remain pleased with the continued success of GeForce Experience, our gaming platform that automatically optimizes your PC settings for each game and downloads the greatest game-ready drivers. At the end of January, just 2.5 years after its introduction, GeForce Experience subscribers stood at $76 million, up 37% on the year. \\\\nMoving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue increased 7%, both sequentially and year over year, to $203 million. The refresh cycle of workstations continued to improve during the quarter, driven in part by new workstation configurations in the market. While VR is often portrayed as a consumer play, we are also excited by its potential in enterprise, particularly in areas such as medicine, architecture, education, and product design. \\\\nAudi now has 20 virtual showrooms, with several hundred expected later this year, that lets customers experience new models, customize them in real-time, and take them for a virtual spin. In a very different application, a startup called Surgical Theater uses flight simulator technology and multiple GPUs to allow surgeons to use VR to fly through a patient\\'s anatomy and rehearse complicated procedures before making the first cut. \\\\nIn datacenter, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 18% sequentially to a record $97 million, up 10% year on year. This reflects the extraordinary rise of deep learning, a field in which we are now engaged with nearly 3,500 companies and organizations, as well as growth in the number of high-performance computing applications that are GPU-accelerated. During the quarter, we launched key products for this market. And a number of the partners provided updates to their own work in this area that underscores the central role of the accelerated GPU platform. \\\\nA key development came during November\\'s Supercomputing 2015 Conference, with the release of the latest list of the worlds top 500 fastest supercomputers. It showed that more than 100 of these systems are now using accelerators. Two-thirds of these use NVIDIA accelerators, up 50% on the year. For hyper-scaled datacenters, we announced a platform that lets web services companies accelerate machine learning. It consists of both the NVIDIA Tesla M40, the most powerful accelerator designed for training deep [nolla] networks, and the NVIDIA Tesla M4, a low-power small form-factor accelerator for machine learning inference. \\\\nWeb services companies have enthusiastically embraced this trend. Shortly after our hyper-scale announcement, Facebook disclosed that it will use the Tesla M40s to power its next-generation computing system for machine learning applications. And earlier this month, AliCloud, Alibaba\\'s cloud computing business, announced it will work with us to promote China\\'s first GPU-accelerated, cloud-based, high-performance computing platform. \\\\nThey joined other web services giants embracing GPUs for machine learning. During the quarter, Google outsourced its TantraFlow deep learning framework, which can be accelerated on GPUs. Microsoft Computational Network Toolkit was integrated with Azure\\'s GPU Lab, enabling neural nets for speech recognition that are up to 10 times faster than their predecessors. And IBM revealed that its Watson systems are now using GPUs. \\\\nProgress continues to be made in our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphs-rich applications to employees on any device, anywhere. More than 100 companies are participating in an accelerated deployment program. \\\\nTurning to automotive. Automotive revenue was a record $93 million, up 18% sequentially, and up 68% year over year. One of the biggest stories at CES was the introduction of our NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 self-driving car platform, which utilizes artificial intelligence to address the profoundly complex challenge of autonomous driving. As many of you saw, DRIVE PX 2 is a supercomputing platform the size of a lunchbox that processes 24 trillion deep learning operations a second, and delivers 8 teraflops of processing power, equivalent to that of 150 [metso pros]. \\\\nIt is a flexible platform that automotive developers can scale from one to four processors. And it can utilize passive cooling or integrate seamlessly with the water-cooling systems of self-driving EVs. Capable of fusing data from cameras, lidar, radar and ultrasonic sensors, it creates a full 360-degree understanding of what is happening around the vehicle. It localizes the vehicle on an HD map, and it determines a safe path forward for using deep learning techniques. \\\\nVolvo, well-known for its safety and reliability, will be the first to develop DRIVE PX 2, using it as the brain force fleet of 100 self-driving cars to be publicly available next year in its hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. Just a couple weeks ago, the first autonomous shuttle, the WEpod, incorporating our deep learning platform, took its inaugural trip on public roads in the Netherlands, where it can be summoned with a smart phone app. \\\\nThe DRIVE PX 2 launch generated enormous interest around the world from car makers, Tier 1 suppliers, and others. We are now collaborating with more than 70 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies. Finally, our OEM and IP business was $198 million, up 3% sequentially, driven by the seasonal demand for notebooks. \\\\nNow turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP quarterly gross margin was 56.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 57.2%, slightly above our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased from a year ago. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $539 million, inclusive of $34 million of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses, including litigation charges, were $445 million, in line with our outlook. \\\\nFor full FY16, our non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.72 billion, including litigation costs. Our focus on rigorous execution and enhancing efficiencies enabled our core operating expenses to remain flat from FY15, as we focused on expanding operating margins. GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $252 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $356 million, up 26% from $283 million a year earlier. \\\\nGAAP net income was $207 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.35, including $0.04 of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP net income was $297 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.52, an increase of 21% year over year. \\\\nNow turning to some key balance sheet items. At the end of Q4, our cash and marketable securities balance was just over $5 billion. During the quarter, we paid $62 million in cash dividends, and we closed our accelerated repurchasing agreement with an additional 4.3 million shares returned. As a result, we have turned to shareholders an aggregate of $800 million in FY16, meeting our intention we communicated at the start of the fiscal year. Over the past four years, we\\'ve returned more than $3 billion to shareholders representing 98% of our free cash flow. As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, our intention is to return $1 billion in FY17 through quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. \\\\nFor FY16, revenue reached a record $5 billion, up 7%. Our growth platforms increased 26% year on year. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 56.8%, up 100 basis points on the year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 18% to $1.13 billion, with operating margin expansion up more than 200 basis points to 22.5%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 18%. \\\\nNow turning to the outlook for the first quarter of FY17. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming remains strong and eSports, VR, and new exciting games will lift it further. GP-accelerated datacenters are expanding in both HPC and cloud, driven by the growth of deep learning. And autonomous driving continues to move forward. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets. \\\\nWe expect revenue for the first quarter of 2017 to be $1.26 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.2% and 57.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected be approximately $500 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of FY17 are both expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%. Further financial details, including the CFO Commentary and revenue by market platforms are available on our IR website. \\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. We ask you that you limit your questions to just two. Ash, would you please poll for questions at this time? \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCertainly. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question, and congrats on the very good growth and execution. My first question, Jen-Hsun, is on the gaming segment. For the last two years, it has grown at over 30% a year. I don\\'t know many other multi-billion-dollar businesses and semis that are growing at this pace. The question really is, how sustainable is this growth? \\\\nI understand the drivers. But could you help us ballpark that going forward over the next two or three years? Do you think of this as a 10%, 15%, 5% growth opportunity? Any guidance there would be extremely helpful. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thanks a lot, Vivek. First of all, I think you captured the essence of it in your question. GeForce is really not a chip business anymore; it is really a gaming platform business. When you think about it from a gaming platform business, it has to be thought of in the context of the low gaming ecosystem and the gaming industry. It is $100 billion large. When you think about it that way and you drive the business that way and you create value that way, I think the prospects for our growth there is still quite significant. \\\\nThere are several different ways we can grow the market. First of all, when we introduce new game platforms -- and this last couple of years, we\\'ve introduced Maxwell, it\\'s the most successful gaming platform we have ever introduced. The installed base of about 100 million GeForce gamers in the world has an opportunity to upgrade to a new platform. \\\\nAnother reason why we can grow is because the production value continues to increase, the graphics richness continues to increase. And we do that by inspiring the industry, providing a technology that helps it include our technology in a much easier way. And the way that we do that is called GameWorks. \\\\nAll the physical simulations, all of the visual simulations, all the lighting simulations and all of the things that makes games beautiful today are easy to include by just supporting GameWorks. It has been an enormous success for us. \\\\nAnd of course, developing companies are still doing incredibly well. There are many countries around the world that are just starting to get into PC gaming. Southeast Asia is growing incredibly. And then not to mention that gaming is no longer just gaming. Gaming is all about sports now. \\\\nBut we\\'re starting to see a new culture and a new dynamic in gaming even beyond that. It\\'s really becoming a platform by which people could share, and a platform by which they could artistically express themselves. If you look at some of these games today, it\\'s something you enjoy well-beyond just playing the game. You use the game as an editor to tell stories. \\\\nAnd so these games like GTA 5, it\\'s just fantastic for telling stories. And so you can see now that the gaming platform is going beyond games, it\\'s going beyond sports, and now it is a creative platform. So there are just all these wonderful ways that the game industry has continued to be vibrant. And my sense is that we\\'re going to continue to grow with it. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. And as a follow-up, Jen-Hsun, on your automotive business, as you move from entertainment systems that are graphics-intensive to more advanced computing systems, do you think it changes the competitive environment? And what I am referring to is, we have seen Qualcomm and others enter the segment, and they are making the case they can integrate a lot of different [piece] parts and tie back to their processor. And I\\'m trying to draw a parallel with what you had on the smartphone side, where you were specializing in one part, but others could integrate other parts and become more successful. \\\\nIs there going to be a similar situation in orders? Or do you think we should read it in a different way as to how your competitive situation can evolve in orders as computing becomes a bigger part of the application? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, we have to be mindful of competition. And there\\'s a lot of ways to compete, there\\'s a lot of different ways to bring value. And surely what you describe is one way to compete. Those aren\\'t really the segments in a market that we\\'ll address. \\\\nThe way we think about infotainment is, there are segments of the infotainment market -- surely the parts of the market that we serve incredibly well -- with the richness of the displays, the number of the displays. And how the displays are going to be used in the coming years are going to continue to expand. You know that display costs are coming down, and outlet displays are becoming cheaper. \\\\nThere are so many different ways to bring visualization into the car, to enhance the driving experience. You can also imagine how artificial intelligence technology can change the way infotainment systems are even used. One of our strategies of course, is to bring artificial intelligence technology to enhance how the driver communicates with the car. So there is all kinds of new technologies that we\\'re going to deploy into the infotainment system, leveraging our expertise in deep learning. \\\\nThe part of the market that you are starting to talk about is the segment of the market that we really introduced into the marketplace, which is the autonomous driving computer. We started talking about it several years ago -- I think it was like three years ago, at CES, when I introduced the DRIVE PX. Where we imagined that in the future, a car would also have a supercomputer inside that is powered by deep learning, that is powered by artificial intelligence. And that takes in the sensor input continuously from the car, what\\'s surrounding the car. And infer from it the appropriate thing to do. \\\\nThat vision three years ago seemed a little bit, if you will, outer space. But I think that it is very clear now that the technology that we are bringing to bear, deep learning, is really the best approach for helping car companies go beyond ADAS, which is going to be a commodity in the coming years, as you can imagine. Go beyond ADAS, and move towards assisted driving to full autonomous driving. So I think that we can add a lot of value there. \\\\nPX2 was really invented to allow OEMs to scale that entire range, from assisted driving all the way to fully assisted driving. And that is one of the reasons why we can support one chip all the way up to four chips, from passive cooling all the way up to integrating directly into the self-driving EV water-cooling system, that is quite available for most EV cars with liquid cooling. So I think that our strategy there is going to work out quite well. We add a lot of value. It is very algorithm-rich, it\\'s very software-rich. And I think our DRIVE PX platforms is really quite state-of-the-art. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you for taking my questions. The first question, on the TDS business, how -- I\\'m sorry, the Tegra development services, you noted that, that was an important driver of growth. Can you give us a little bit more color on that business? How big is that? What end markets are you working with? What are you helping customers do? Can you hear me? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nActually, I\\'m just trying to figure out what your question was. Let me see. I guess I\\'d be reluctant to announce anything today, but there are semi-custom businesses that people need our help on. And we are open for business to help select partners develop proprietary systems that leverages the wealth of technologies that we have, whether it is in visual computing or deep learning or supercomputing. \\\\nSo we can create systems and products and services that the world has never had before. That\\'s an area that I think is of interest to us. It\\'s an area that we will likely see a lot more success in the future. But there is not much to really announce today. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay, fair enough. And second question on the gross margins. They\\'ve gone over the last three years from the low-50%s, pushing through 57% now. At what point do these [asset tow out]? How should we be thinking about that? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI appreciate that question. There are a lot of moving parts in our gross margins. Of course, our enterprise business is richer in gross margins. Our consumer business tends to be lower in gross margins. But at the highest level, the way I would think of our Company\\'s gross margins, it\\'s the nature of our business model is changing. \\\\nIf you think about our business model, a long time ago, it  used to be a chip business, but today we are a differentiated specialty platform business. What I mean by platform business is, it\\'s of course the chips, the systems, but it\\'s largely about the differentiated software that\\'s on top of it. \\\\nSo increasingly, you\\'re going to find that our business is software-rich, it\\'s services-rich. And if that is the case, one would think that our business model would become increasingly of that nature. And I think you\\'re just seeing the reflection of that. \\\\nAs our Company continues to move towards our differentiated platforms -- which was, call it, 50% just a few years ago, and is now reaching some 80% now -- as we move into these specialty differentiated platforms, the software content is just much, much higher. And our customers who work with us are not buying chips for their systems, for their commodity systems, but they are looking for a platform to solve a particular problem. And the problems that we would help solve, the solution that we bring to bear, is so high-valued, that I think that increasingly you should expect that -- well, you should hope, and I hope myself, that our gross margins continue to move along with the change in our business model. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates - Analyst    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat, thanks, and congratulations, guys. Jen-Hsun, can you give us an update on the high-performance compute side of the business? How will Pascal compare to the upcoming other solutions in the market, specifically Intel\\'s Knights Landing? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, Hans, thank you. Our high-performance computing business uses an architecture we call accelerated computing. Accelerated computing is a model of computing that we invented almost 10 years ago. It\\'s a very unique way of computing, and it takes advantage of the strength of the CPU, as well as the advantage of the world\\'s most parallel processor, called the GPU. It is very software-intensive, it is very mathematics-intensive, it\\'s very algorithm-intensive. \\\\nIt\\'s a problem that, when applied to some verticals, can accelerate computing dramatically. We see accelerations of 5x, 10x, 20x, quite normally, quite regularly. And the way that you translate this benefit to a customer is that it reduces their costs. Instead of building a supercomputer that may cost as much as $500 million, this supercomputer would be the world\\'s best at $100 million. \\\\nThat\\'s a pretty substantial reduction in expenses. The power-build that they would spend on a regular basis would be dramatically reduced. So datacenters and supercomputing centers save an enormous amount of money. \\\\nOn the other hand, the researchers see a substantial boost in their application throughput. So that is one of the reasons why accelerated computing is doing really well. We are seeing a couple of different drivers for accelerated computing and high-performance computing. Our datacenter business -- accelerated computing itself for supercomputing applications, whether it is weather simulation or molecular dynamic simulation -- continues to grow. \\\\nThe killer app that we are starting to see -- and we have been cultivating for several years now, and it\\'s now really turning the corner and going into turbo-charge and growth -- is deep learning. Almost in every field of science, as well as for web services companies, artificial intelligence helps them wade through, comb through just massive mounds and oceans of data to discover insight. So deep learning and using artificial intelligence technology across all fields of science -- I\\'m super-excited about the work that\\'s going to be done in medicine. It\\'s really going to see some great adoption. \\\\nI think we mentioned that in just a couple of years ago, we had 100 companies working with us in the area of deep learning, and now it has ballooned to 3,500. That is quite a large-scale growth. It is in industries all the way from life sciences to supercomputing of course, to web services of course, to even industrial. And the application for industrial would be Internet of Things. All of these sensors all around the world collecting data needs artificial intelligence software, deep learning software, to review insights. \\\\nIn terms of our positioning relative to the competition, this is an area that we have a real advantage, and we have a real advantage for several reasons. The incremental cost to our Company, the incremental cost of engineering accelerated computing into our normal course of running our GPU  business, GeForce business, is incremental. So the system, entire system, the 10,000 people in our Company, can quite easily, if you will, continue this rhythm. And quite a high-velocity rhythm, of bringing out new GPUs that are great for accelerated computing and great for gaming of course, and great for workstations. \\\\nAnd it\\'s a natural course of doing work. This is not an adjunct business to us. This is our core business. At the core, that is our fundamental advantage, that it\\'s a singular motion, singular execution, singular investment, singular architecture, incredibly leveraged, and the execution, as a result, is just absolutely flawless. So I think in the end that, that\\'s our greatest advantage. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates - Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVery helpful, thanks, Jen-Shun. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAbsolutely. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, this is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow up on your Tesla business. I think in a recent earnings call, Cray actually reiterated its expectation of over 50% of this $25 million revenue in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. And I think they cited DRIVE as one of three supercomputers that actually use Pascal. So how should we think about the benefit to your Tesla business? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, Cray is a very important partner of ours. The thing that is really exciting for me, is to see them transition their business -- not transition, but transform their business, from one that is really focused on supercomputing centers to one that is also working on big data. This is an area where we can add a lot of value to them. We have a lot of expertise in this area. \\\\nAnd as they continue to evolve their market footprint beyond supercomputing centers and now into large enterprises, I think they can find a lot of success. They are seeing a lot of this success in this area. Big data analytics is square in their bull\\'s eye, and I\\'m quite excited for them in the work that they are doing there. They are good customer for us, a great partner of ours and I\\'m excited to see their ongoing success. \\\\nThe thing we are all seeing is that big-data analytics, the most powerful weapon for big-data analytics has recently been discovered. Deep learning is just a fantastic new computing model. It is able to discover insight that is provably now superhuman. \\\\nIts dimensionality in thinking through data is unrivaled in any approach that we have learned in the past. And that\\'s one of the reasons why industries all over the world, from life sciences to industry to manufacturing to supercomputing, are jumping on the deep learning bandwagon. I think their adoption of Tesla, the NVIDIA GPU, is going to be quite a success for them. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks. As a follow-up, [your spend] seems to spend about $90 million in legal expense. How should we think about in FY17? And also, and can you give an update where you are in the case of [Qualcomm] and Samsung? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJust as a backdrop, we litigated against Samsung last year. The expenses was what you are referring to. At the core of it, fundamentally, philosophically, we believe that it is inappropriate and it\\'s wrong for Samsung to use NVIDIA\\'s technology -- technology that has cost us billions of dollars to invent and use it without compensating us. At the core, I just think that is just wrong. And we think it\\'s wrong, and that\\'s the reason why we decided to litigate to sue Samsung. \\\\n The ITC has passed it\\'s early decisions, and we disagree with them, we are disappointed by them. It\\'s unfortunate that the business courts couldn\\'t see through the obviously complex data associated with the technology. But we are disappointed by it. We have appealed for a review, and hopefully, in the near term, we will discover what the ITC will do. \\\\nBut I still believe that it was the wrong thing to do, for Samsung to use technology that companies who are specialized in these fields invent, and to use it without compensation. And I\\'m disappointed with the decision from the ITC, but so be it. \\\\nNext year, we have plenty of things to go invest in, and we have plenty of growth drivers. You know that we have four powerful growth drivers in our Company. Gaming is one, VR is another, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. And we have plenty of growth drivers to go focus our Company on. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nC.J. Muse,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGood afternoon, thank you for taking my first question. I guess first question, on the auto side. I\\'m trying to get my arms around how we should think about growth year in calendar 2016 off this 75% growth in 2015. If you could parse between your backlog for infotainment and your outlook there, as well as what kind of ramp you see with product development contracts on the ADAS side? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTwo questions there. First of all, our pipeline. We\\'ve talked about our pipeline several times. We\\'ve shipped probably 5 million, 6 million cars. We have another 20 million, 25 million cars to ship in our pipeline. So these are design wins that took quite a few years to have won, and quite a few years of engineering to ramp into production. \\\\nSo we have a pretty good visibility of the pipeline and the opportunities that are ahead of us. Probably there is some market dynamics that\\'s helpful to some of the design wins, the segments that we serve. Of course, at the time, a long time ago, it\\'s hard to tell. But it\\'s very clear now that the computerization of cars is a highly desirable end-user feature. \\\\nThe partners that we worked with, the car companies we worked with, to computerize their cars, whether it is Audi or Tesla, whose cars are heavily computerized. Their growth prospects in the coming years are quite good. So I think that\\'s one. We have a clear view of the pipeline, and I think the mega-trends of the computerization of cars is in our favor. \\\\nNow you mention -- secondarily, we introduced this platform called DRIVE PX. It is our economist-driving car computer platform. And the recent success of ADAS has really inspired just about every car company in the world to look beyond ADAS and what\\'s beyond ADAS is self-driving cars. \\\\n It could be partially assisted, it could be mostly assisted, and it could be completely assisted. And in each one of those levels of autonomy, a different amount of computation would have to be deployed. We\\'ve created a scalable architecture that allows car companies to develop cars that are partially assisted, all the way to completely assisted. \\\\nWe are working with quite a large number of customers now. Car companies, startup companies, companies that are largely cloud-based and have an enormous amount of data that they could transform into an automotive service, transportation-as-a-service. And so we are working with a whole lot of different types of companies, and I think this is going to be an area of quite a significant industrial revolution. And arguably quite a gigantic society good in the long term. So anyways, we are working on a lot of projects there. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Chin with UBS. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, the first one for you, if I could. In terms of the deep learning, machine learning opportunity, I was wondering if you could help quantify sort of the longer-term silicon TAM for the opportunity, both in datacenter and automotive? And I guess more near term, any thoughts on what kind of development revenues could be generated for these machine learning-type platforms in the near term? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, thanks. I think part of the answer is, I\\'m not sure. Part of the answer is, I\\'m not sure. So with that as a disclaimer, let me tell you why I\\'m so enthusiastic about it. There are many problems that computer science has been trying to solve which, algorithmically, is just impossible to solve. There is no known way of a human-described algorithm that completely captures the noisy and long tail of society. \\\\nAnd it could be almost any problem. It can be weather-related-type problems. It could be market-related-type problems. It could be all kinds of purchasing-related challenges, and all kinds of data. It could be life sciences, as we know that the human body is not in a perfect condition all the time, that randomness that plays a role in understanding molecular science. There are so many different types of areas where there is no simple Newtonian physics equation that can describe the nature. \\\\nSo in that particular case, using an enormous amount of data to train the neural net, to train software, to rewrite the software, if you will, using an enormous amount of computation, is a pretty exciting computation model. I think this is a brand-new computing model, one that is going to augment the traditional model of symbolics and computer programming. This is going to be a data-driven type of computing model. In this particular case, GPU accelerated computing is really quite ideal and the computing model that we invented some ten years ago is really quite ideal. \\\\nHow big is it? I think that it could be quite significant. And we are starting to see, of course, the type of companies that are jumping on top of the deep learning bandwagon. They are great companies, from Google to Facebook to Vidu to IBM to Alibaba, to just about every hyperscale web services company in the world, is jumping on this. Because they have enormous amounts of data and it has very, very long tails. And traditional segmentation is too contrived of an approach to find great insight. \\\\nNow that the companies with a great deal of web-based data, cloud-based data, have already starting to engage in this area, they are starting to implement artificial intelligence into one application after another. I think we already heard them announce that it\\'s very likely they will put artificial intelligence into every single application they have. We are starting to see this sweep across industries. \\\\nThe automotive industry, of course, has the longest tail, as the world is a very noisy place. And in order to create a car that can navigate through it, the long tail of a very complicated world has to be handled somehow. Writing software programs is just not going to do it. So using an ongoing learning artificial intelligence network could be exactly the solution for it. Life sciences, industries, manufacturing, supercomputing, financial services -- the list goes on and on. And we are seeing a lot of enthusiasm. \\\\nBefore everybody can use deep learning, they have to train a network. And this is an area where we have a great deal of expertise. This year, as you know, we also announced our first hyperscale inferencing engine. It\\'s our first end-to-end training-to-inferencing -- inferencing is predictions, the application of the network. So from training all the way to inferencing, we now have a complete architecture that is architecturally compatible. \\\\nThe Tesla M40 is for training, and the Tesla M4 is for inferencing. The M4 is a little, tiny credit card-sized GPU, and very low-power, incredibly energy-efficient. And you can connect it into just about any hyperscale datacenter in the world. And we are sampling customers now. \\\\nThe results are quite exciting. Customers are very enthusiastic about it. I think we could dramatically reduce the cost of datacenters all over the world, as they start to ramp up artificial intelligence in their everyday workload. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay, I appreciate that color, Jen-Hsun. And as a quick follow-up, I have one for Colette on the inventory levels. \\\\nColette, just given where inventories ended for the quarter, it\\'s -- on a days and a dollars basis, it\\'s roughly comparable to a number of quarters back, when revenues were about 20% to 30% lower than where it is today. Is this a new level that the Company can continue operating at, just based on supply chain efficiencies? Or is there some -- a seasonal volatility in December or any other kind of average ASP of the [prox] that you are carrying? Thanks. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, Steven, thanks so much for the question. Our inventory levels that we are holding here, they are definitely going to swing a bit in terms of the mix, in terms of our platforms. But what we have right now, we do have a very healthy level of inventory. And we have a great team of people managing all of those different pieces, both for the channel, for our partners, and definitely for what we need to ship going forward. \\\\nSo I don\\'t think we look at a number to exactly optimize in any single one quarter, as we do make sure that we are prepared for the platforms coming down the pipeline, as well as what customers need. But you are correct, it is probably at a fairly healthy low level at this time. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura Securities. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSanjay Chaurasia,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, Jen-Hsun. One question on deep learning. I was wondering if you could talk about relative opportunity sizes in training and inference part of the deep learning? Clearly you have a strong position on the training side. I would love to hear your thoughts of the inference side. My understanding is, a lot of custom chips are being built in the industry on the inferencing side. So I would love to get your color on what competition you\\'re foreseeing on that front? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. Here is my guess. I think long term, training will be half of the overall market. And the reason for that is because training is so heavyweight. And in the long term -- well, not long term now -- you\\'re training your network constantly. \\\\nYou create a network. You want to improve this network as fast as you can, because you have so much valuable data and so much insight that you can go after. And you deploy the network for inferencing, which collects brand-new data. And the world looks completely different to you. \\\\nYou now collect that data, and you use that data to train your network. I think that network training is going to be continuous basis, and we\\'re seeing that, absolutely. Also there are more types of networks. \\\\nThe type of networks that are being created, the rate of revolution, the rate of innovation of networks -- network styles, network types, network configurations, network depths. It is happening every single week. I\\'m actually not exactly sure how you would design a custom chip for it. Which explains why there are only two chips today that are successful in inferencing. One of them is the Intel Xeon, and the other is the Tesla M40 and M4. \\\\nSo I think the ability to adapt to new algorithms quickly, it\\'s really quite vital as we go through the next several years of this artificial intelligence revolution. There is just so much algorithms being developed, and I think you guys are reading about it constantly -- new breakthroughs in AI, new breakthroughs in network design. At the moment, I just really don\\'t know how someone would settle down and design a custom chip for it. \\\\nI happen to believe that long term, artificial intelligence is not a chip. Artificial intelligence is a computing model. And a computing model needs processors. And processors are programmable. And these programmable processors need to have rich software development environments around it, and these platforms need to be available all over the world. \\\\nToday the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform is available in a PC, in a work station, in a laptop, in the cloud, in a car, in robots, in embedded environments, and it\\'s all exactly the same architecture. I think that, that\\'s really one of our advantages, that we have the ability to be adaptable, programmable, and yet we are available in literally every single computing platform form-factor you can imagine. And the accessibility of NVIDIA\\'s architecture is literally global, worldwide and within reach for anybody. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for letting me ask a question. One for either Jen-Hsun or Colette. In your first-quarter guidance, it looks like the down-10% has some seasonality to it. But you also have a lot of businesses that have secular trends behind them. So I was hoping that you could provide a little color on seasonality versus secular? \\\\nOr which of the drivers would be better or worse than that 10%? Acknowledging also that you lose a week of business guiding into that April quarter. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, first of all, I appreciate your question. I think, first of all, it\\'s just the guidance, and it\\'s our best view today, it\\'s our most prudent view today. And as you know, although there are many things we know, the world is a very uncertain place. \\\\nThere\\'s a few things that we do know. The gaming market is quite vibrant. It continues to be quite vibrant. We monitor it literally every day, every week. And we monitor it all over the world, and it remains quite vibrant. \\\\nIn the coming months, there are some really wonderful games that are coming out, that we think are going to be spectacularly successful, whether it is The Division or Tomb Raider or -- the list goes on. So I think the gaming market appears to be quite vibrant. \\\\nOur automotive business is vibrant, and the work that we do in self-driving is really gaining traction and capturing the imagination of just about every car company around the world. Our deep learning work and supercomputing work, our high-performance computing work is accelerating. \\\\nIn a lot of ways, I understand where you\\'re coming from. But we don\\'t want to ignore seasonality. Q1 is Q1, and we recognize that the market is uncertain. We will see how it plays out. At the end of the quarter, we\\'ll come and report it again. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) \\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, good afternoon, and congratulations on another solid quarter. Jen-Hsun, you talked about the installed base and the upgrade opportunity in gaming, I think, last call. You quantified it as around three-quarters of the installed base that really needs a more updated GTX processor. \\\\nGiven the 37% growth in the gaming business last year and the success of Maxwell, it actually does appear that you did drive some meaningful upgrade in the installed base. So the question for you is, is there any updates to your views on where the installed base sits at from that upgrade opportunity? And then the second question is, do you get a sense that the cadence of these upgrades will be accelerating, given the advancements you and your gaming engine partners are bringing to the market every year? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThose are really good questions. We monitor our installed base pretty carefully. Currently in the installed base, we basically have three architectures still in operation. We have the Maxwell architecture, and we have the Kepler architecture, and the Tesla architecture. \\\\nAll of those -- oh, excuse me, the Fermi architecture. Those architectures are all running in the installed base at the moment. We have managed upgrade about one-third of the installed base. \\\\nMeanwhile, it is the case that ASPs of our chief use are going up, because the graphics richness and the graphics production value is going up. The quality of games -- because the market for games is so high, game developers can really create much more beautiful games, and take the risk to do that. \\\\n The developing markets are growing. The number of genres, like eSports, of games are growing. So there\\'s a lot of different growing vectors. \\\\nMeanwhile, all of that is on top of our desire to upgrade our installed base, so they can enjoy games the way that it ought to be enjoyed. I think there is still a fair amount of growth opportunity ahead of us, and we will monitor it carefully and report it once a quarter. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag with Macquarie Capital. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDeepon Nag,  Macquarie Capital - Analyst    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thanks a lot, guys. So Quadro grew for the first time, I think, in several quarters. Can you describe what drove that growth, and how we should think about the growth profile for the rest of this year? Is it possible that it could grow in the mid-single-digits for all of 2017? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, Deepon, thanks for the question. I was delighted myself. I will just put that out there. We worked really hard to improve our Quadro business. The team works incredibly hard. We invented a new technology for rendering called Iray. It\\'s the world\\'s first physically modeled photo-realistic renderer that is accelerated by GPU. The results of it is really quite remarkable, and they continue to add new capabilities to it. \\\\nWe, this last quarter, also benefited from the enthusiasm and excitement around VR. And we have VR SVKs and collaborations with just about every ISB in the world that is working on VR. So I think there\\'s a lot of good reasons to be enthusiastic about Quadro. \\\\nWe don\\'t believe for a moment that the design quality and design production value of movies or games or architecture or manufacturing will continue. We believe absolutely that it\\'s going to continue to improve. And visual realism and the productivity of the engineers that are involved, the artists that are involved, needs to continue to increase. \\\\nSo we think this is going to be a vibrant growth area ahead. I think that what drove recently the uptick on the OEMs refreshing workstation cycle. And I think we should enjoy some of that for the coming quarters. \\\\nBut I still think long term, the real opportunity, surely the market is there. We know that more and more of design and creativity is done digitally. So at the core, the market is there. The opportunity for us is to bring new forms of rendering, new forms of design. And as you can see, Iray is for rendering, and VR is for interacting with the design. These type of capabilities require just an enormous amount of GPU capability. And I think at the core, that is going to be our long-term growth drivers. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat, thank you. Can you give us some color on what you are seeing in emerging markets, with a lot of macro concern about some of your end markets, notably China? And you guys keep putting out very good numbers. Can you just sort of talk about that demand by geography, and how you weigh the economic and currency risks over the course of this year? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. For some reason, I still tend to believe that what drives the gaming market is great games. And I think that there is some evidence that the continued release of great games and great production value games, the vibrancy of eSports, the fact that eSports is really not just for competition, but drives the dynamic of sharing and social. Those kind of factors continue to drive our gaming business. \\\\nI\\'m quite enthusiastic about the developing markets. Southeast Asia, for one, is really starting to adopt PC gaming quite rapidly. It is a market that is extremely underserved. India is a market that is extremely underserved. They are underserved because broadband Internet hasn\\'t been available to those marketplaces until just recently. And there are surely demographics in these markets that would love to jump onto gaming. \\\\nWho doesn\\'t need a PC? So almost every market develops around PCs quite rapidly. I think the way of enjoying games is so affordable by adding a GeForce GTX to a PC that you already own, it\\'s the most affordable form of entertainment, if you think about it that way. Most of eSports are free to play anyhow. So much of it is, anyhow. So it is a wonderfully affordable way to enjoy entertainment. So I think the Southeast Asia, India, are really quite exciting developing markets. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much. Jen-Hsun, there\\'s been a lot of speculation about how the emergence of VR headsets, in particular for gaming, would drive your GPU business. I guess I would like to hear your perspective on a couple of things. One, obviously it requires high-end and high GPU use to support some of these applications. So of the early adopters, maybe a sense of which of those folks might already own those type of GPUs, and which ones might have to upgrade in the near term? \\\\nAnd second, how VR might penetrate the [East Forts] phenomenon over time and drive more of those upgrades into the higher-volume mainstream parts of the gaming market? Thanks. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. There are really two questions in your question; they are both good. One question is, how do I feel about VR and its impact on gaming? The second part is, how will VR impact our business? \\\\nLet me tell you the second part first. We are not forecasting and not assuming any upside in VR. However, there\\'s no way but good that VR will bring to our business. And we will take it a day at a time. \\\\nWe believe that it\\'s going to be an exciting growth driver. We believe that is going to be helpful to our high-end GPU business. But when the time comes, it will be a nice bonus. \\\\nSo we\\'re going to run our business as if we don\\'t count on it. However, obviously we care very deeply about it, because we think that the experience of VR is quite amazing. Anybody who has tried it is surprised how immersive it is, how it takes you away from where you are and into another world. You are really suspended in disbelief, and it\\'s as close to a holodeck as we have ever experienced. \\\\nSo we believe strongly that VR is going to be fantastic for entertainment, it\\'s going to be fantastic for games. We also believe that it\\'s going to be fantastic for all of our pro-business. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if the segment of our business that it helps the earliest may very well be our professional business. \\\\nThe reason for that is because there are many applications that are mission-critical. Even though the headsets are not free, it\\'s quite affordable. And for people who have power walls and use large displays, VR is actually an incredible cost reduction. \\\\nAlmost anybody can now have a virtual reality cave, which cost tens of thousands of dollars. Anyone can now have a power wall, which costs tens of thousands of dollars. And now for just a few hundred dollars, have all the benefits of that. \\\\nSo I think that you could tell that I\\'m very enthusiastic about it. We are developing a lot of fresh technology and new enabling technology to make it possible. We are working with all the market leaders to develop the market and cultivate the market. And then from a financial perspective, we will just see how it plays out. My sense is that it\\'s going to be a really nice bonus. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Hemmelgarn with Barclays. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Hemmelgarn,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks very much for taking my question, and congrats on the good quarter. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks a lot, Chris. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Hemmelgarn,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nFirst of all, we\\'ve talked a lot about some of the really exciting businesses that have a lot of great growth prospects for you. I thought we would look at, as well, some that have been a little more stagnant. And I was curious to your take on, for example, the OEM business. \\\\n It looks like it may finally be stabilizing after declining. How do you look at that business in the coming fiscal year? Do you think it can even get back to growth, or do you expect continued declines? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, my sense is that it will stabilize, and let me tell you why. Our OEM business is not about gaming, because it is our gaming business. And the OEMs are not about design, because that\\'s our design business. \\\\nBut the thing that some OEMs do is, they include our technology to differentiate a mainstream platform from a premium platform. So by adding NVIDIA\\'s technology, you turn a commodity PC into a premium PC. And the experience is better, the performance is better, and everything just works. \\\\nSo there is a real benefit in using it as a premium multimedia PC, if you will. So we\\'ll probably see continued interest in doing that. And we are delighted by that. We don\\'t count on it, but we\\'re delighted by it. So my sense is that it will likely stabilize. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland with FBR & Company. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChris Rolland,  FBR & Company - Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHey, guys, thanks for the question, and great quarter. Speaking about your installed base briefly, can you guys share with us your view on GPU replacement rates? How fast are they or how long are they now, and whether they are shrinking or speeding up here? And also perhaps how they might differ by geography? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI don\\'t know if I have the precise granularity by geography, except for just a few countries. But let me address it overall. The installed base takes a couple two or three years to upgrade. And on the lower end, three to four years. On the higher end, one to two years. And so overall I guess, because the lower-end products are higher in volume, it would probably weigh the overall average to call it three-plus years. \\\\nBut the ASP, of course, if you look at it from an ASP perspective, it\\'s a little bit different -- it would probably drift up. The rate of upgrade appears to be increasing. I might also explain that the ASP of our overall portfolio increasing. I think the reason why it\\'s increasing is because the size of the gaming market has now grown to a level that developers can take a fair amount of risk to add a rich content, rich production value in graphics, which they didn\\'t used to be able to do. \\\\nThey now have the benefit of a large installed base, a PlayStation an Xbox, a Nintendo and PCs, that they could actually create content that is really, really quite beautiful and technologically rich. Which drives up the adoption of higher-end GPUs, because you need higher-end GPUs to process it. I think that is quite a significant factor. \\\\nI think the other factor is that the game consoles, although nowhere near the performance level of our high-end GPUs, on average, is higher in terms of capability than our average installed base. That is actually terrific news for us, because a PC gamer who wants to enjoy games that are adapted from game consoles, which all of them are, now would have to upgrade their GPUs to enjoy at least a game console experience. \\\\nSo I think that bottom half of our installed base has a real opportunity to enjoy at least a game console experience for just $150. For a $150 graphics card, you can get experience that is superior to a game console. That is quite an amazing value. That, I think, is also another reason to spur adoption. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRajvindra Gill,  Needham & Company - Analyst    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, and congrats as well. Just a follow-up question on the virtual reality market and how you are looking at that. \\\\nCan you talk a little bit about some of the PC requirements that are going to be necessary to use in Facebook, Oculus Rift headset when it comes out this quarter? And the cost that is going to be needed for the individual user? And contrast that from the business model that Sony is employing, which is basically, based on my knowledge, a bundling strategy with their PlayStation 4, which wouldn\\'t require an upgrade to the graphics card or buying a new desktop? Just wondering how you think about those two different business models? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThere are two different questions in there. One question is, what is the minimum requirement for VR today? Using today\\'s graphics card as an example, the GTX 970, which is the most popular graphics card in the world, is the min spec for the Oculus Rift. And the reason why, of course, is because Oculus and their PC focus wants to have the best possible experience for the early adopters of VR, and I think that is a really prudent strategy. You want to delight all of your early adopters with the best possible experience. \\\\nBut the way to think about it long term is that, as the market continues to grow and more content comes and VR moves into the mainstream, there is no question in my mind that our $100 and $150 GeForce GTX cards will, in the future, be able to play VR just perfectly. So this is not a question about the availability of technology or the cost of technology. As we know, technology continues to advance, and whatever experience today will continue to get more affordable long term. \\\\nWhatever the Sony PlayStation does, I think is just fantastic either way. What we would like to do is get people excited about VR. \\\\nAnd in the final analysis, there are TV gamers and then there are -- there are console gamers and there are PC gamers. They are different genres, and they are different applications and different styles, and very largely different customers. So I think we are just enthusiastic about VR, period. And over time, the technology will more and more affordable. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOur final question comes from the line of Brian Alger with Roth Capital Partners. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBrian Alger,  Roth Capital Partners - Analyst    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for squeezing me here at the end. I\\'ll be very brief. The opportunity in automotive obviously continues to grow. And your unveiling at CES was impressive by anyone\\'s standards. However, there seems to be two approaches to the automotive market as we move forward. There is obviously the closed system approach that Mobile [Life] seems to be pursuing, and what appears to be more of an open-architecture approach that you seem to have. \\\\nCan you maybe describe how things shape up for you as you look out over the horizon with sensor fusion and the various OEMs, and getting things right from a safety standard space, et cetera? Do we need the control of a closed system, or can we get it done with collaboration with others? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. I appreciate the question. It\\'s really a good question. This is really a matter of philosophy. And philosophically, this is how we see the world. We believe the self-driving car is not a solved problem. I say that as a statement of fact. I don\\'t think anybody would dispute it. \\\\nI also believe that self-driving cars is a field that\\'s going to require the technological muscle of a very, very large industry, and that no one company with a few hundred employees is going to solve it all by themselves. The idea that a unsolved problem of such incredible daunting levels, that an entire computer industry is in the process of trying to solve, could possibly be a closed system tied around a chip, seems illogical to me. That\\'s number one. \\\\nNumber two, I believe that long term, our car company, the soul of the car company is the driving experience of that car. The soul of the company is the safety record of that car. The soul of the company is the functionality of that car. In the future, the functionality, the safety, the driving experience of the car is going to be largely software-defined. It\\'s going to be artificial intelligence network-defined. \\\\nI just can\\'t imagine great companies like BMW and Mercedes and Audi and all of the world -- Toyota, and the list goes on -- and many great companies that are emerging into this marketplace. I just can\\'t imagine that these companies would somehow outsource the soul of their car to a chip company. That is a second philosophical belief. \\\\nSo what we have decided to do is to create an automotive autonomous car computing platform and all of the rich software that is necessary to enable this incredibly high-throughput computer to behave in a really energy-efficient way and cost-effective way. And to be able to apply our deep learning expertise, so that these cars can benefit from artificial intelligence to solve these really complicated world problems. And that by partnering with every single car company in the world, that together we might be able to solve this incredibly daunting challenge, and hopefully bring some society good. \\\\nSo that is our approach as the open platform. And it starts really from a philosophical approach. Now, that philosophical approach results in a very substantial technological difference. \\\\nNotice that our platform is completely programmable. We have rich tools. We know that developers all over the world can easily buy themselves a GeForce TITAN and write CUDA applications. And those CUDA applications will tomorrow run on a DRIVE PX just seamlessly. \\\\nSo I think that is a wonderful way for designers all over the world to be able to develop software -- which is really hard to do right now -- and then quickly deploy it into the car. So our strategy is just very, very different, and that is our approach. And my sense is, at the moment, it appears to be quite a good approach. \\\\nOkay, I really appreciate that question. NVIDIA is the world leader in visual and accelerated computing, which is helping to create exciting growth markets like VR, AI, and self-driving cars. Which will transform many industries and positively impact the future of society. Our strategy is to leverage one core investment into four growth markets -- gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and auto. And it\\'s delivering results and gaining momentum. Our goal is to balance investments to capture the enormous opportunity ahead, while maintaining a keen focus on improving near-term financial performance. \\\\nI also want to remind everyone that our annual GPU Technology Conference will take place April 4th through the 7th in San Jose. We will be focusing on VR, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. We will also be holding Analyst Day there, and I look forward to seeing all of you. Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue reached $3.18 billion, up 21% from a year earlier, with all 4 of our market platforms growing double digits. Data center, professional visualization and automotive all hit record levels. However, gaming was short of expectations as post crypto channel inventory took longer than expected to sell through. Gaming card prices, which were elevated following the sharp crypto falloff, took longer than expected to normalize.\\\\nOur Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipments in the midrange Pascal segment to allow channel inventory to normalize. In Q4, we also expect minimal sales of Tegra chips for game consoles due to the normal seasonal build cycle. While channel inventory situation presents a near-term headwind, it does not change our long-term fundamentals. Our competitive position is as strong as ever, and we have expanded our addressable market with Turing and our recent software announcements. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars.\\\\nGAAP gross margins grew 90 basis points year-on-year and non-GAAP gross margins rose 130 basis points. This reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms but also included a $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff of crypto mining demand. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 million for the fourth consecutive quarter.\\\\nFrom a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 25% from a year ago to $2.77 billion. Tegra processor revenue was down 3% to $407 million.\\\\nLet\\'s continue with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.76 billion was up 13% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by initial sales of our new Turing-based GPUs as well as strong notebook sales, which more than offset gaming console declines. In mid-September, we began shipping GeForce RTX series, the first gaming GPUs based on our Turing architecture. Turing RTX technology delivers up to 2x the performance of its predecessor, Pascal, and 6x more for ray-traced graphics. These are the biggest generational jumps we have ever delivered in gaming GPUs.\\\\nThe first 2 GeForce RTX gaming cards to hit the shelves were the 2080 Ti and the 2080, delivering 4K HDR gaming and 60 frames per second on even the most advanced AAA titles, a major milestone for gamers. This is quickly becoming the new performance baseline as 4K displays are now reaching affordable price points. These 2 end -- 2 high-end cards were quickly followed by the rollout of the GeForce [27 D]. NVIDIA RTX technology brings games to life like never before. The highly anticipated Battlefield V launched this week with the first release of RTX ray-tracing, enabling lifelike reflections on GeForce RTX GPUs. With a pipeline of upcoming games supporting NVIDIA RTX features, RTX is well on its way to establishing itself as a game-changing architecture.\\\\nAlthough the cryptocurrency wave has ended, the channel has taken longer than expected to normalize. Pascal high-end cards have largely sold through ahead of RTX. However, on midrange Pascal gaming cards, both channel prices and inventory levels remained higher than expected. Pascal is well positioned as the GPU of choice in the midrange for the holidays, and we expect to work down channel inventories over the next quarter or 2.\\\\nMoving to data center. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $792 million, up 58% year-on-year and up 4% sequentially. Demand remains strong for Volta architecture products, including Tesla V100 and VGX systems, and our inference business continued to grow, benefiting from the launch of the Turing T4 Cloud GPU during the quarter. Just 2 months after its launch, the T4 has received the fastest adoption of any server GPU. It is integrated into 57 server designs and it is already on the Google Cloud Platform, its first cloud availability. The T4 delivers world record performance for deep learning inference and accelerates diverse cloud workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, machine learning, data analytics and graphics.\\\\nWe also announced an updated TensorRT software stack and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Platform. This new software includes 2 critically important capabilities that can drive deployment of the NVIDIA inference platform at scale in hyperscale data centers. First, it enables multiple models and multiple frameworks to run on the same GPU at the same time. This can drive higher data center utilization, directly translating to significant savings. Second, it integrates with Kubernetes, the leading orchestration layer for hyperscale data centers.\\\\nCompleting our inference platform, the new T4 GPU delivers 12x the peak inference performance of its T4 predecessor. All told, our inference platform delivers 40x faster performance in CPUs. And with the TensorRT software stack, it is ideally suited for hyperscale data centers. With this launch, NVIDIA is poised to take the data center inference market, targeting every server node in the hyperscale data centers.\\\\nAnother important launch for the quarter was the NVIDIA RTX Server reference architecture, which incorporates up to 8 Turing-based RTX 8000. With this product, Turing opens a new market to GPOs, photoreal rendering or the creation of computer-generated images that look real. Rendering is instrumental to large industries, such as media and entertainment, retail, product designs, manufacturing and architecture. Yet prior to Turing and its ray-tracing capabilities, GPUs were not able to address this workload. So most rendering at -- up to this point has been done on CPUs. An RTX-accelerated render farm compared with an equivalent performance CPU render farm is 1/4 the cost, 1/10 the space and 1/11 the power. NVIDIA\\'s RTX platform has garnered major industry support, including from key developers such as Adobe, ANSYS, Autodesk, Dassault and many others.\\\\nLastly, NVIDIA announced a GPU acceleration platform for data science and machine learning called RAPIDS, which enables companies to analyze massive amounts of data and make accurate business predictions at unprecedented speed. Up until now, data analytics and machine learning has been the largest high-performance computing applications not to have been accelerated. Virtually all enterprise use data analytics to extract insight from big data for a wide range of use cases, such as predicting credit card fraud, forecasting retail inventory and understanding customer buying behavior. RAPIDS is an open source suite of libraries for GPU-accelerated analytics, machine learning and, soon, data visualization. With RAPIDS, NVIDIA GPUs can now accelerate machine learning, as we have done with deep learning, with performance up to 50x faster than CPUs. The RAPIDS launch opens up a $20 billion server market used for data analytics and machine learning workloads to GPUs, and it\\'s received broad industry support, including from Oracle, IBM, SAP, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure machine learning, Google, Q-Flow as well as the open source community.\\\\nWith one unified architecture and ecosystem, NVIDIA GPUs can address the redefined high-performance computing market, including scientific computing, deep learning and machine learning. Our GPUs and software stack accelerate a broad and diverse set of workloads, ranging from scale-up software in supercomputers to scale out deployments in hyperscale data centers. Just earlier this week, this capability was on display at Supercomputing Conference in Dallas, where the number of systems on the TOP500 supercomputer list using NVIDIA GPUs jumped 48% from last year, including the #1 and #2 systems in the world.\\\\nMoving to pro visualization. Revenue reached a record $305 million, up 28% versus the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Strength extended across the desktop and mobile as well as several key industries, including the public sector, manufacturing and architecture, engineering and construction.\\\\nAt SIGGRAPH in August, we announced our Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs based on the Turing architecture. And earlier this week, we introduced the Quadro RTX 4000, the most advanced professional GPU priced under $1,000. These GPUs will revolutionize the work of 50 million designers and artists by enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real-time and leveraging AI in their workflows. The Quadro RTX series started shipping in Q3, with the server-grade, high-end products recognized in data center. We already engaged with a range of customers on RTX, including the major movie studios and game developers, and the reaction has been very positive.\\\\nFinally, turning to automotive. Automotive sales in Q3 reached $172 million, up 19% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagement in addition to the ramp of next-generation, AI-based cockpit infotainment systems.\\\\nAt GTC Europe, we announced that Volvo Cars selected NVIDIA\\'s DRIVE AGX Xavier next-generation -- for next-generation Volvo Cars. The initial production release slated for the early 2020s will deliver Level 2+ assisted driving features, integrating 360-degree surround perception and a driver monitoring system. This is our first Level 2 mass-market car design win. In addition to Volvo, global automotive suppliers, Continental and Veoneer, announced that they have selected NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for their autonomous driving systems. Lastly, our DRIVE AGX Xavier development kit started shipping in this quarter. This is the world\\'s first autonomous driving platform, and it can run our NVIDIA DRIVE software for autonomous driving, including data collection, 360-degree surround perception, advanced driver monitoring and in-vehicle visualization. With this platform, customers have developed and test their autonomous driving solutions and then easily move into production. We are excited about the AV opportunity as we look into next year and beyond.\\\\nMoving to the rest of the P&L and the balance sheet. Q3 gross margins was 60.4% and non-GAAP was 61%, below our outlook due to the $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff in crypto demand. GAAP operating expenses were $863 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $730 million, up 28% year-on-year. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, data center and automotive.\\\\nGAAP net income was $1.23 billion, and EPS was $1.97, up 48% from a year earlier. GAAP net income benefited from the reduction of $138 million in our U.S. tax reform transition tax amount as well as other discrete tax items. Non-GAAP net income was $1.15 billion and EPS was $1.84, up 38% from a year ago, reflecting revenue growth and gross margin expansion as well as lower income tax expense.\\\\nAccounts receivable was $2.22 billion compared to $1.66 billion in the prior quarter as Turing\\'s RTX shipments began in the latter part of the quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $1.42 billion compared to $1.09 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting the ramp in production of Turing products.\\\\nQuarterly cash flow from operations was $487 million. Capital expenditures were $150 million. This fiscal year, we have returned $1.13 billion to shareholders through the end of Q3. We\\'ve announced a $0.01 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 effective in Q4 of fiscal 2019. We are also pleased to announce an increase of $7 billion to our share repurchase authorization and that we intend to return an additional $3 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2020.\\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As noted earlier, our revenue outlook is impacted by the expected work-down of Pascal midrange gaming card inventory in the channel. In addition, we expect a decline in our gaming console revenue given seasonal build patterns. Keep in mind that the midrange desktop portfolio is typically about 1/3 of our gaming business. Our outlook assumes that channel inventory weeks approach normal levels exiting Q4 and that gaming and demand increases in Q4 compared with Q3.\\\\nNow in total, we expect revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.3% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $915 million and $755 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $21 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $190 million to $210 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.\\\\nIn closing, I\\'d like to highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We\\'ll be presenting at the Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 6, and we will be meeting with the financial community at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January 8 through 11. And our next earnings call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 will take place on February 14.\\\\nWith that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Within your guidance for the January quarter, is the team anticipating continued sequential growth in your data center business? There seems to be some concern around a near-term slowdown in cloud spending. But on the flip side, we\\'re hearing that the NVIDIA team is actually seeing pretty strong demand, near term, from some of your China cloud customers for your Tesla-based products. So I just wanted to get your views on cloud data center dynamics and the trajectory into the January quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, we expect to continue to do well in data centers. The -- if you look at the background of what\\'s happening, we know that Moore\\'s Law has ended. And while demand for computing continues to grow and more and more of the data center is running machine learning algorithms, which is computationally really intensive, the only way to increase computational demand -- or computational resource is to buy more computers, buy more CPUs because each one of those CPUs aren\\'t getting much faster. And so as a result of that, the data center CapEx would have to go up. The alternative, which is the alternative that we offer and is one of the reasons why the adoption of NVIDIA\\'s accelerated computing platform is growing so fast, is because the approach that we provide allows for a path forward beyond Moore\\'s Law. There are several things that we have done this last quarter that I think is really fantastic. The first is the introduction of a new computing platform, new accelerated platform called RAPIDS. And as you know very well that the vast majority of the industry today, although are super excited about deep learning, deep learning as a method for artificial intelligence is very data-intensive. And in areas where there\\'s a lot of domain expertise, where there\\'s -- whether it\\'s in retail or whether it\\'s in financial services or health care, logistics, there\\'s a fair amount of domain expertise, and the amount of data that they have to fuse together to train a model is quite high. The approach using traditional machine learning is quite successful. That has never been accelerated before. And we worked with the open source community over the course of the last several years to pull together an entire stack that starts from Apache Arrow, the Dask parallel distributed computing engine, and then all of our CUDA and all of our algorithms that run on top of that. We now have an accelerated machine learning platform. That\\'s a brand-new platform, and the excitement around that is really quite incredible. The second thing is the Turing architecture allows us to do film rendering at a much, much more affordable way than Moore\\'s Law would have allowed. And then the third, which we just announced recently, is our first Turing-based T4 Cloud GPU. And along with all of the software stack that we\\'ve put on top of it, Kubernetes, the Docker, the TRT inference engine, our second-generation Tensor Core, AI accelerator, all of that together has created a lot of excitement in data center. So I\\'m expecting our data center business to be -- to continue to do quite well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And then just on the high-end Turing products that the team started rolling out in October, early demand actually seems to be quite strong. And I think part of it is just the lineup of AAA-rated games. eSports continue to be strong as well, obviously a big motivator for your enthusiast-class gamers. I know the team is, near term, kind of working down midrange Pascal cards, but do you anticipate your Turing-based RTX product families to drive sequential growth in the January quarter just what appears to be pretty strong demand pull for these products?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, the Turing launch happened towards the end of the quarter, and it\\'s the biggest generational leap we\\'ve ever had. It introduced real-time ray-tracing. It\\'s the first GPU to -- gaming GPU to include artificial intelligence. At every single price point it serves, it is substantially higher performance than the last and it\\'s the highest performance GPU in the world. And all the great content are coming. Today, I think it is -- or yesterday, I think it was, the Battlefield V was released with real-time ray-tracing, the world\\'s first application to support real-time ray-tracing. So I -- we expect Turing to do really well. As we go on, surely, we\\'ll bring Turing deeper into the mainstream. And so we don\\'t have anything to announce today, but as usual, we want to bring a brand-new architecture to as many gamers as possible.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had a question on the gaming outlook and as it relates to channel inventory. Colette, you mentioned that typically, the midrange is about 1/3 of gaming. How much was it in the October quarter? And are you effectively assuming close to 0 in the January quarter? And related to that, I think with your game console business, I\\'m estimating you did something around $200 million to $250 million in October. Again, is that coming down pretty hard into January?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I commented about the overall size of what we have traditionally seen in terms of the midrange over a fairly large period of time because keep in mind, the launches of products quarter-to-quarter have changed that. So it has been about 1/3 consistently over, let\\'s say, about an 8-quarter period of time. And we think that\\'s a good number for you to use as we look at our guidance in terms of Q4. From an overall console perspective, we again have seen about -- in the hundreds and sometimes more than that in prior quarters. What we\\'re seeing is just a normal where they build ahead of the holidays in Q3, and that slows down as we move into Q4 when we\\'re in the middle of the holidays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And then as a follow-up, you saw nice acceleration in growth in your ProVis business this quarter. Jen-Hsun, I think you\\'ve talked extensively about the RTX and the long-term opportunity there. What are your expectations going into 2019 for that segment?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I expect ProVis to grow. The ProVis platform, more -- there\\'s more content ever being created that is digitally created. And most photographs -- what appears to be photographs are rendered in software. Almost every catalog, every video, every movie, every TV show now has a great deal of digital rendering in it. And until now, it\\'s not been possible to do the rendering in an accelerated way. So RTX is the world\\'s first accelerated ray-tracing GPU, and the enthusiasm from the digital content creation market is really, really great. I surely expect that -- and as I was mentioning earlier, that it\\'s been close to a decade that the workstation industry has not had a fundamental platform architecture change. And so RTX is the first one. So I\\'m expecting ProVis to do really well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m curious, Jen-Hsun, what needs to happen to work down this midrange Pascal inventory? Is it pricing? Is it something else? Because the thinking was that this could be cleared within the October quarter, but it hasn\\'t. Do you think people were waiting for Turing to come out and maybe that created some kind of pause? And then as part of -- part B of that question, maybe Colette, how should we think about seasonality in the April quarter given that you mentioned it could take 1 or 2 quarters to work down this inventory?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, the -- well, we came into Q3 with excess channel inventory post the crypto hangover. We expected the pricing in the marketplace to decline. It declined slower than we expected and -- but while it was declining, we were expecting sales volume to grow, demand to grow and for pricing to be -- for volume to be elastic with pricing. I think it just took longer than -- the pricing took longer than we expected, and the volume increase took longer than we expected. At this point, most of the pricing has come down to its -- and slightly below its prelaunch levels. And so I\\'m hoping that -- I\\'m hopeful that now that pricing has stabilized, that customers will come back and buy. I guess when pricing is volatile in the channel, it probably freezes some people waiting for prices to stabilize, and that took longer than we expected frankly. But now that it\\'s at the right levels, our expectation is that the market will return to normal. 1060 is the #1 selling graphics card in the world, and we decided not to sell any more into the channel for the upcoming quarter to give the channel an opportunity to sell through the inventory it has. And so we\\'ll keep our eyes on it, but our expectation is that inventory levels will come back to normal by the end of the quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Vivek, to answer your question also regarding Q1 in terms of what we\\'re going to see in terms of the expectation, as the channel inventory normalizes at the end of Q4, we do believe going into Q1, we will be probably up from where we end in terms of Q4. So we won\\'t follow that normal seasonality between Q1 and Q4. We do expect to be up as we go into Q1.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You have a question from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess, a follow-up question on the channel inventory side. It looks like it\\'s roughly $600 million kind of a drawdown here. And just curious, does that sound right? Number one. Number two, does that fit with what you are hearing from your channel partners in terms of what\\'s excess? And then as part of that, are you drawing down inventory in the current quarter ahead of Turing architecture launch into the mainstream?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The last question, I\\'m not sure I understand. The -- I think the answer to your first question is yes. You framed it nicely. It\\'s -- the answer is yes. The last question was what again?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The last question was regarding our midrange. Is there any statement about future Turing products that were taken into account?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We -- yes, we haven\\'t announced our future Turing product, but it would be expected for us to create a Turing GPU that serves the mainstream parts of the marketplace. And so we\\'re not announcing anything, but it would be conventional of us to do that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess, the question was whether you were drawing down inventory perhaps below normalized levels in the current quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, we\\'re really not shipping into the midrange segment of Pascal so that we give the channel an opportunity to sell through the product that has. And we would like to see channel inventory get normalized by the end of Q4, and then we\\'ll get back to doing our work.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          My first one is for Colette. I just wanted to be a little more explicit. If I think about your business split into sort of gaming and non-gaming, are you looking for the non-gaming pieces in aggregate to grow sequentially into Q4?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Stacy, yes. I think the answer to that is yes. In aggregate, yes, we do believe the rest of the business will grow sequentially.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. I guess that fits with the kind of 1/3 you\\'re talking because that implies the gaming down 30%-plus. So that is what your kind of a magnitude that you\\'re thinking about at this point.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That is correct.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. For my second question, I just wanted to -- for the last several quarters, the idea that the channel could be getting full is not necessarily a new worry. And yet the last several quarters, you\\'ve been saying, like on this call, that you guys felt like you had a really good handle on the channel, and yet it seems like maybe that wasn\\'t exactly the case. Can you give us a feeling, maybe a better feeling for what changed and when you saw it in the quarter? Was this something that happened kind of like late in the quarter that you realized it? Or did you go into the quarter knowing that the inventories were high and needed to be corrected? Like what happened? Because this tone is a little different from what we\\'ve heard over the last few earnings calls from you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let\\'s see. The -- we were surprised, obviously. I mean, we\\'re surprised by it, as anybody else. The crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected. Prices started to drift down, and we expected to come down much more quickly than it did and -- but -- and when it went down, we expected demand to come up much more quickly than it did. And so I think the channel wanted to protect its price. People were uncertain about crypto, and demand was uncertain about when the price will be stabilized. And so all of that uncertainty, I think, froze the market a little longer than we expected. Pricing is now down to below prelaunch normal levels. And so I am hopeful that we\\'re going to see demand come back and the sell-through will happen through the holidays. And we\\'re seeing that. And so that\\'s -- the first one is that we -- just we didn\\'t expect it either and we didn\\'t realize the magnitude of it until towards the end of the quarter. What was the other question? Was there another question? I think that, that was it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          With regards to Turing ramp, I guess, how is that going relative to your expectations? It seems like availability is quite a bit better now. And where do you stand with DLSS support? I know you\\'ve announced a number of games that will have DLSS support by year-end. Like how many of those are already supporting that technology?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, the ramp is going great, and I think this is the biggest generational leap we\\'ve ever had. This is the most substantial new technology that computer graphics has seen in a decade. Real-time ray-tracing is something that everybody had dreamed about for a long time. It\\'s never seen before. And today with Battlefield V, people are enjoying real-time ray-tracing for the very, very first time. And the images are beautiful. So the ramp is great. Of course, Turing ramped into -- towards the end of the quarter and into a much more different situation than any GPU of the past. But nonetheless, the demand on the high-end products are fantastic. The 2080 Tis are largely sold out. I think it\\'s still sold out everywhere. And so I think that the demand is great. I\\'m expecting it to be just a fantastic new generation. In terms of the content, you saw the first one. FINAL FANTASY is also out. And we have a pipeline, about 30 of them. We\\'re working hard on that. And so when they -- when these games get released, RTX will be enabled. But I will say one last thing, which is content aside, RTX is higher performing at the same price point than any graphics card on the planet. And so at every single graphics -- every single price point, it is the highest performing graphics card. So it is unambiguously the highest performance GPU in the world and then -- and of course, all of these great new features will be coming.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nPierre C. Ferragu,  New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m still trying to put my head around the magnitude of this channel inventory drawdown because if you don\\'t ship like the midrange cards for a full quarter, that means your inventory today is more than a quarter, more than 12 weeks of sales. And so my first question would be, am I right thinking that? Are you available a full quarter of sales in inventories?\\\\nAnd then my second question is while you are drawing down this inventories, I would have expected to see, like, the Turing high-end card, the 2080 and the 2080 Ti ramping in Q4. And it looks like, excluding the inventory, the rest of the business -- the rest of the GPU business in gaming would be more like flattish sequentially.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m trying to figure out what the first part of the question was.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSimona Jankowski,  NVIDIA Corporation - VP of IR    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The first question was whether the midrange of Pascal had more than 12 weeks of inventory, if it\\'s going to take more than a quarter to bring it down.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the channel has more than 12 weeks of inventory between us and the other brand. One of the things that is hard to estimate is how much inventory the other brands have. And our quarter is 1 month later. And so whatever action we take, whatever we see in the channel is 1 month after their end of the quarter. The amount of inventory is not just us. It\\'s also the other brands. And our ability to see the other brand\\'s inventory is just much harder. We try our best to estimate it, but obviously, we didn\\'t estimate it well enough. And so the answer to your question is yes, I think there\\'s about -- from our perspective, about 12 weeks of our inventory to sell through at this point.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The -- I was hoping you could contrast this product cycle transition to Turing to the product transition you had to Pascal. And is the only -- or is the main difference the crypto hangover? Or is there something else impacting the transition, do you think? I mean, you\\'ve described Turing as the greatest generational leap, and I\\'m wondering if that larger delta has an impact to the transition as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Turing is the highest performance GPU at every single price point. And so it played no role in its transition. It\\'s all about crypto hangover. This is the new experience as we made this transition. If you look at Turing on -- just on the basis of Turing, it had a great launch. We ramped it at the end of the quarter, as we expected. It was back-end loaded, as we expected, and the ramp was great. Everybody did a great job. And the performance is fantastic, and the excitement is great. And so I think Turing\\'s ramp was a big success. It\\'s -- underneath Turing was choppy, as we\\'re talking about. And we really didn\\'t see that until towards the end of the quarter. And as we looked out into this quarter, this coming quarter, we came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is just not to ship any more products into this segment of the marketplace because there\\'s a fair amount of inventory and let the channel sell through the midrange Pascals. And then a quarter\\'s time, we\\'ll get back to business. And so I think -- I knew this is surely a setback, and I wish we had seen it earlier, in the final analysis can\\'t be exactly sure what we would have done different. But between the unexpected, unanticipated slow decline of pricing in the channel and even after the prices came down, it took a little longer than we expected for volume to kick up. And the other brand\\'s inventory in the marketplace, those factors kind of compounded and made it a lot worse than we expected.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You have a question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Maybe I can ask the question a little bit differently on the gaming business. If I look back over the past several quarters, let\\'s say you\\'ve been running at roughly a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion revenue level since the October \\'17 quarter. Prior to that, you were at $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion. We look like we\\'re now going back to that level. I guess, the question is, do we build off of that level? Do we bring back half of the inventory burn? How do I think about the return of year-over-year growth in that gaming piece of the business as we start to look into fiscal 2020?\\\\nAnd then a quick second question. Over the past few years, you\\'ve had really strong seasonal sequential growth in the data center business, in Q4, about 20% sequentially. I\\'m just curious, how is your guide factoring in the sequential growth in that piece of the business into this current quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Let me take the second one first. Our data center business is doing great. I mean, the fundamental dynamics of accelerated computing is spot on. And with Moore\\'s Law coming to an end, it\\'s the path forward. Take a look at the number of systems in the TOP500, 127 systems, I think, this year was, a growth of nearly 50% year-over-year. We\\'re the #1 system in United States and the world, in Europe, in Japan. We\\'re 22 out of the top 25 most energy-efficient computers in the world. And then this quarter, we announced 3 new initiatives that\\'s going to expand us into a broader part of the high-performance computing market with machine learning, which is -- as we know, is the largest part of artificial intelligence today, which has not been accelerated and now it is. The second is the ability to do rendering for film, photorealistic rendering for the first time. And then the third is a brand-new cloud GPU, we call T4, that the enthusiasm around it is just incredible. And from the time that we went to production to the time that Google put it in their cloud was literally 30 days. It\\'s just an incredible speed of adoption. And so I expect T4 to do quite well. So I think our data center business dynamics are really quite great. In terms of forecast, we\\'ll just see how it turns out. But I think the fundamental dynamics are great. Back to your question about gaming.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So the statement came in regarding, you\\'ve bumped up the overall gaming somewhere in mid of the year to about a $1.7 billion gaming business, where maybe if you look back 2 years, you were at about $1.1 billion. At this stage, when you come out of the setback that we have here to get through the overall channel inventory, where will you come out after that? And what type of growth could we expect?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I\\'m going to let you guys do the modeling, but let me just say this. There\\'s nothing fundamentally different about the gaming market that we know. Cryptocurrency is an extraordinary factor that we all have to just internalize as it is. And we thought we had done a better job managing the cryptocurrency dynamics. But when the prices came down -- started to come down and we hoped the demand would start to reflect the declining price, it just took longer than we expected. And that\\'s what we\\'re experiencing. In terms of the gaming marketplace, if you take a look at some of the dynamics, our notebook gaming, which is not affected by crypto, grew 50% year-over-year in China. And so the gaming market seems quite robust. RTX is going to unquestionably redefine gaming computer graphics. And so I think that the dynamics are good. We have to work through the channel inventories. This quarter, of course, we had the simultaneous decision of not shipping any more midrange products into the channel as well as seasonal -- normal seasonal console build plans. And they tend to build out a quarter before the holiday season. So you have these 2 simultaneous effects. But there\\'s nothing about the gaming marketplace or the gaming business that we see that\\'s fundamentally different.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. To kind of add to that, think about our gaming business in several pieces that we talked about in terms of the tremendous strength that is also continuing. In terms of our success in terms of Turing, our notebooks for gaming are growing extremely strong, and our overall console business is also extremely healthy as well. So to think about all of the different components, we just have a piece of channel inventory at the midrange, but overall, as you can see, gaming is also growing quite well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          A question with regard to inferencing and what we can expect from that for both Q4 and going forward. And perhaps I don\\'t know if it\\'s a valid comparison to compare what we might expect from inferencing after the new Quadro launches to what happened in training after the Volta launches. Is there any comparison there in terms of magnitude for how the ramp goes?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The ramp of T4 is completely related to customers porting their model on top of our platform. And the inference model is really complicated. This is one of the things that I\\'ve talked about in the past that on the one hand, people think that inference appears to be simple because there are so many ASICs built being talked about. The vast majority of the complexity of inference is actually in the optimizing compiler on top. The TensorRT, fifth-generation optimizing compiler that we announced just recently took 3, 4 years to build. And then on top of that, in order to get it to scale as quickly as what people saw in Google -- Google\\'s cloud requires us to build something called a TRT server, an inference server, that allows multiple models to run on top of Kubernetes in the cloud. That piece of software is also super complicated to write. And so the pieces of technology that we\\'re putting together have come together. And now we\\'re engaged with Internet companies around the world to port their most heavy workload applications on top -- or models on top of T4. And so we\\'re working hard on that. And when that happens, it comes down to their decision of how many they would like to buy, and that tells us about our adoption rate. I think from a high-level perspective, if we step back for a second, the high-level -- the way to look at it is this: that we know for a fact that Moore\\'s Law has come to an end, and at the same time, we also know that more and more data centers are deploying deep learning models and machine learning models into their data center. And it\\'s computationally really intensive. And at this time and as we look out into the horizon, the T4 Cloud GPU is just unquestionably the most effective. It can run models, whether it\\'s an image model or a recommendation model or a speech synthesis model. It is the highest throughput processor in the world at 70 watts, which fits into a hyperscale data center OCP server. It is also the lowest latency of any processor at inferencing in the world at less than 1 millisecond. And so between the architecture, all of the software technology and all of the software capabilities we put in place and the fact that the conditions would suggest that Internet companies need an accelerated path forward, I think T4 is really well positioned. And I look forward to coming back and telling you guys about success.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You have a question from Will Stein with SunTrust.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWilliam Stein,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First, Jen-Hsun, I appreciate all the details on the T4 for inference in the data center. Could you likewise highlight the current traction you\\'re seeing and the long-term growth expectations for the Jetson product that\\'s designed for really, I think, a different market? It\\'s inference at the edge, right?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Jetson is designed for edge AI. One version of Jetson, which is a functional save, high-performance with a lot of complicated software, one version of that, you could say, is self-driving cars. And this quarter, we announced winning our first mass-market Level 2. We\\'ve been really successful in robot taxis and Level 4s and trucks and shuttles and high-end systems, where the number of processors, the number of sensors, the combination of LiDARs and surround cameras requires a lot of computation and -- but we\\'ve never been successful until now with taking the DRIVE platform all the way down to Level 2 mass-market cars. Volvo is our first announcement, our first win in high-volume, early 2020s production ramp. And I\\'m expecting many more. And I think we\\'ve positioned and created a solution that is both highly useful and easy to use as well as could deliver Level 2 capability in a single chip for the very first time. And Xavier is in production. It is the only single-chip, autonomous vehicle processor in production today. Then you take that same platform and you could apply to all kinds of other edge AI devices. It could be manufacturing picking robots. It could be autonomous retail, basically AI retail, and autonomous warehouses. So -- or medical instruments, medical imaging instruments that, in the device itself, recognizes and identifies anomalies. And so all of this type of applications are leaning towards AI, and that\\'s the reason why we built Jetson.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Andrew Ellis,  B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division - Senior MD & Director of Research    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'ll ask a clarification and then a question. The clarification is just on the inventory issue, and thanks for all the color. But one, are Pascal 1070s and 1080s and in Ti flavors still selling? And if so, could they present any kind of inventory risk either later this year or in early fiscal \\'20?\\\\nAnd then the question really, Jen-Hsun, is trying to get a better understanding of how you see the intermediate-term growth rate of the data center business. You had spectacular high-performance compute TOP500 accelerator penetration performance up 50-plus percent. That about matches the growth in the data center business. Those may be somewhat coincidental, but can you just talk about where you see penetration across key end markets like HPC, like cloud and hyperscale and like enterprise? Which offer you the best growth from here? And where do you feel like your penetration may be more mature? I\\'m just trying to get a sense if there\\'s an acceleration coming off of the 50% year-on-year growth that we\\'re seeing now or if, consistent with the recent trend, we might be moderating potentially down into the 40% or 30% range as we go into the next calendar year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our high-end Pascal GPUs are largely sold. And we did a fairly good job making sure that -- with that transition before we ramped up the high-end Turing products. The -- our data center business, I would say that Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3, this last quarter, the inventory setback aside, I actually have to say that it\\'s one of the best quarter we\\'ve ever experienced. And the reason for that is because our data center position, our accelerated computing position as a company, which is the foundation of this company, the accelerated computing focus of our company expanded in really several ways. For the first part of our journey into accelerated computing, it was really following scientific computing, simulating first principle laws of physics for scientific computing and high-performance computing codes. About 5 years ago, deep learning came into the fore, and we were alert and agile to have invested a great deal and mobilized the company to go help the world put deep learning into software developers\\' hands all over the world. The area where I\\'m super excited about right now are the 3 that I\\'ve mentioned that we\\'ve opened up in this last quarter with the launch of Turing and with the launch of RAPIDS. The first is our film rendering opportunity is -- we think that there\\'s about 10 million CPU nodes around the world that are used for film rendering. They can now benefit from accelerated computing as Moore\\'s Law comes to an end. The second is opening up inference. The hyperscale data center marketplace is something along the lines of 15 million CPUs sold this year. And it was growing -- let\\'s call it, growing at about 15% per year and -- the number of CPUs. And we know for a fact that Moore\\'s Law has come to an end and those servers are going to have to be accelerated going forward. And so I think that T4 is just ideal for that. It was designed from the ground up to deliver computing in a very, very compressed and very condensed and power-sensitive environment, which these hyperscale data centers tend to be. And the software stack from Kubernetes to containers, to a TRT compiler, to the TRT inference server and our NGC cloud with all of the stacks fully accelerated and containerized in the cloud, certifying all of the major cloud providers around the world for our containers, that process took us several years and it\\'s put us in a really great place. So T4 is really fantastic. And so that\\'s -- the second segment of high-performance computing is deep learning. The third and potentially the largest currently is machine learning. This is where Hadoop goes. This is where Spark goes. This is where scikit-learn, Python, pandas. All of the data scientists around the world in retail, in transportation and logistics, in health care, in financial services that are using algorithms like random forest and XGBoost and k-nearest and k-means and PCA and all of these different buzzwords have never had the opportunity to have accelerated computing until now. And this took a couple, 2, 3 years for us to pull together. RAPIDS has been open sourced. You can go into the NGC cloud, download it. IBM is going to integrate it into their machine learning platform. SaaS, SAP, Oracle, the cloud providers are all integrating the RAPIDS open source SDK into their machine learning platform. And so this is a new segment for us.\\\\nThe answer about our growth rate is, I believe, that our accelerated computing, our data center opportunity has significantly expanded during the quarter. Between the T4 hyperscale cloud GPU and RAPIDS machine learning platform, it has -- and our RTX server film rendering, we surely have expanded our data center opportunity. And so I fully expect us to continue to do well in accelerated computing for data centers.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Unfortunately, we have run out of time. I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, everyone. To sum up, the crypto hangover has left the industry with excess inventory -- excess channel inventory. It will take 1 or 2 quarters to work through it. This is an unexpected near-term setback and doesn\\'t change the fundamental dynamics of our company. The end of Moore\\'s Law has cleared a way for NVIDIA accelerated computing as a great path forward. Turing opens up 3 exciting markets for us with ray-tracing games, film rendering and hyperscale inference. And with our first win in mainstream Level 2 self-driving cars with Volvo, our DRIVE AV platform is gearing up for the mass market, and our competitive position has never been stronger. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you for joining.

We also benefited from both the winding adoption of deep learning and our expanding engagement with hyperscale data centers around the world as they apply deep learning to all the services they provide. \\\\nRevenue continued to accelerate, rising 24% to a record $1.43 billion. We saw strong sequential and year-on-year growth across our four platforms. Gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Our business model based on driving GPU compute platforms into highly targeted markets is clearly succeeding. The GPU business was up 25% to $1.2 billion from a year ago.  The Tegra processor business increased 30% to $166 million. \\\\nIn Q2, our four platforms contributed nearly 89% of revenue, up from 85% a year earlier and 87% in the preceding quarter. They collectively increased 29% year-over-year. \\\\nLet\\'s begin with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue increased 18% year on year to $781 million reflecting the success of our latest integration of Pascal-based GPUs. Demand was strong in every geographic region. \\\\nThe Pascal architecture offers a number of amazing technological advances. It enables unprecedented performance and efficiencies for playing sophisticated AAA gaming titles and driving rich, immersive VR experiences. \\\\nIn our most successful launch ever, we introduced four major products. They are GeForce GTX1080, 1070, and 1060 for the enthusiast market and the Titan X, the world\\'s fastest consumer GPU for deep learning development, digital content creation, and extreme gaming. \\\\nWired magazine called the GTX 1080 an unprecedented piece of electronic precision, one that performs Herculean feats of computational strength. Forbes called GTX1060, which brings a premium VR experience within reach of many, a fantastic product, and Hardware Canucks describes Titan X as a technological tour de force with frame rates that are simply mind-boggling. The GTX 1080, 1070, 1060, and Titan X are now in full production and available to consumers worldwide. \\\\nVR\\'s potential is on vivid display in a new, open source game that we released during the quarter. Available on Steam, NVIDIA VR Funhouse is an open source title created with our GameWorks SDK. It integrates physical simulation into VR along with amazing graphics and precise haptics that you feel like you\\'re actually at a carnival. \\\\nMoving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew to a record $214 million, up 22% year on year and up 13% sequentially. Growth came from the high end of the market for realtime rendering tools and mobile workstations. The M6000 GPU 24-gig launched earlier this year is drawing strong interest from a broad range of customers. \\\\nDigital Domain, a leading special effects studio, is using Quadro to accelerate productivity for its work on films and commercials, which requires especially tight turnaround times. Engineering giant AECOM and the Yale school of architecture are using Quadro to accelerate their design and engineering workflows. \\\\nLast month at SIGGRAPH conference, we introduced a series of new products that embed photo-realistic and immersive experience into workflows incorporating Iray a and VR. We launched the Pascal-based Quadro P6000, the most advanced workstation GPU, enabling designers to manipulate complex designs up to twice as fast as before. We demonstrated how deep learning is being brought to the realm of the industrial design to create better products faster.  And, we launched eight new and updated software libraries such as VRWorks 360 video SDK which brings panoramic video to VR. \\\\nMoving to data center, revenue reached a record $151 million, more than doubling year on year and up 6% sequentially. This impressive performance reflects strong growth in supercomputing, hyperscale data centers, and grid virtualization. Interest in deep learning is surging as industries increasingly seek to harness this revolutionary technology. \\\\nHyperscale companies remain fast adopters of deep learning. Both for training and realtime inference, particularly for natural lingual processing, video, and image analysis. Among them are Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Ali Baba, and Bidoo.  Major cloud providers are also offering GPU computing for their customers. Microsoft Azure is now using NVIDIA\\'s GPUs to provide computing and graphics virtualizations. \\\\nDuring the quarter, we began shipping Tesla P100, the world\\'s most advanced GPU accelerator based on the Pascal architecture. Designed to accelerate deep learning training, it allows application performance to scale up to 8 GPUs using our NV link interconnect. We also announced a variant of P100 based on PCI express that makes it suitable for a wide range of accelerated servers. \\\\nAt our GPU Technology Conference in April, we introduced DGX1, the world\\'s first deep learning super computer.  Equipped with eight P100s in a single box, it provides deep learning performance that is equivalent to 250 traditional servers. It comes loaded with NVIDIA software and AI application developers. \\\\nWe are seeing strong interest in DGX1 from AR researchers and developers across academia, government labs, and large enterprises. Two days ago, Jen-Hsun hand-delivered the very first DGX1 production model to the open AI institute. They plan to use the system in part to build autonomous agents like chat box, cars, and robots.  Broader deliveries, will commence later this quarter. \\\\nWe will be talking more about deep learning later this year at regional versions of our GPU technology conference set for eight cities around the world. Among them Beijing, Amsterdam, Tokyo, and Seoul, as well as Washington DC. \\\\nOur grid graphics virtualization business more than doubled in the quarter. Adoption is accelerating across a variety of industries, particularly automotive and AEC.  Among customers added this quarter was StatOil, a Norwegian Oil & Gas Company. \\\\nFinally, in automotive, revenue increased to a record $119 million, up 68% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially, driven by premium infotainment and digital cockpit features in mainstream cars. Our effort to help partners develop self-driving cars continues to accelerate. We have started to ship our drive PX2 automotive super computer to the 80-plus companies using both our hardware and DRI work software to develop autonomous driving technologies. \\\\nWe remain on track to ship our autopilot solution based on the drive platform. Beyond our four platforms, our OEM and [IPA] business was $163 million, down 6% year on year in line with mainstream PC demands. Now, turning to the rest of the Income Statement, we had a record GAAP gross margins of 57.9% while non-GAAP gross margin was 58.1%. These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success of our platform approach, and strong demand for deep learning. GAAP operating expenses were $509 million, down 9% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $448 million, up 6% from a year earlier. This reflects increased hiring in R&D and Marketing expenses, partially offset by lower legal fees. \\\\nGAAP operating income for the Second Quarter was $317 million compared to $76 million a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating income was $382 million, up 65%. Non-GAAP operating margins improved 680 basis points from a year ago to 26.8%. \\\\nNow, turning to the outlook for the third quarter of FY17,we expect revenue to be $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.8% and 58%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. \\\\nGAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $465 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter of FY17 are both expected to be 21%, plus or minus 1%. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. \\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) \\\\nYour first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the data center business.  Can you all help us understand to what extent is the demand being driven by the deep learning applications versus the classic computationally intense design applications? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Mark. Data center -- our data center business is comprised of three basic markets as you\\'re alluding to. One of them is high-performance computing, and one could say that or characterize it as a traditional supercomputing market, very computationally intensive. A second market is grid which is our data center virtualization, basically graphics application virtualization. You could stream and serve any PC or any PC application from data center to any client device.  And, the third application is deep learning, and this is largely hyperscale data centers applying deep learning to enhance their applications to make them much smarter and much more delightful. The vast majority of the growth comes from deep learning by far, and the reason for that is because high performance computing is a relatively stable business. It\\'s still a growing business, and I expect the high-performance computing to do quite well over the coming years. Grid is a fast-growing business.  I think Colette said that it was growing 100% year-over-year, but it\\'s from a much smaller base, and deep learning is not only significant in size, it\\'s also growing quite substantially. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s very helpful, thank you.  And then, last question. On the new -- so, you\\'re just starting to ship Pascal now.  I guess my understanding is that historically as you\\'re shipping a new product, the yields have opportunity for improvement, and the more volume you ship the more you climb down the yield curve. What classically happens to here on the yield?  And, does that positively impact gross margins over the next three or four quarters? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, so we\\'ve talked extensively about the way we prepare for new process nodes over the last several years. For long-term NVIDIA followers, you might have recalled that 40-nanometer was a very challenging node for us.  And, with all of these challenges, it\\'s an opportunity for us to improve our Company.  We\\'ve implemented a very rigorous process node preparation methodology, and it starts, of course, with some of the world\\'s best process engineers, circuit design engineers, and process readiness teams.  We have a fantastic group dedicated to just getting process ready for us.  \\\\nAnd, the second part of it is how that process readiness is integrated throughout the entire Company so I\\'m really proud of the way that the Company executed on Pascal. 16-nanometer finfet is no trivial task, not to mention the speed of the memories that we use. It\\'s the world\\'s first G5x. We also ramped the world\\'s first HBM2 memory and 3D memory stacking.  So, the number of technological challenges that we overcame in the ramp of Pascal is quite extraordinary.  I\\'m super-proud of the team. Going forward, we are going to continue to refine yields, and that is absolutely the case. However, we came into 16-nanometer with a great deal of preparedness, and so it\\'s too early to guess what\\'s going to happen to yields and margins long term.  But, we\\'ll guide one quarter at a time. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Toshi Otani. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshi Otani,  TransLink Capital - Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi.  Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a very strong quarter. Your Q3 revenue guide implies further acceleration on a year-over-year basis. Are there one or two end markets where you expect outsized growth?  Or, should we expect growth in the quarter to be broad-based? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, Toshi. I appreciate it. We are experiencing growth in all of our businesses. Our strategy of focusing on deep learning, self-driving cars, gaming, and virtual reality where markets -- these are markets where GPU makes a very significant difference is really paying off.  And, this quarter is really the first quarter where we saw growth across every single one of our businesses, and my expectation is that we\\'re going to see growth across all of our businesses next quarter as well.  But, it\\'s driven by the focus on these key markets and away from traditional commodity components businesses. I think one particular dynamic sticks out, and it\\'s a very significant growth driver where we have an extraordinary position in.  It\\'s deep learning. Deep learning, you may have heard is a  new computing approach. It\\'s a new computing model and requires a new computing architecture, and this is where the parallel approach of GPUs is perfectly suited.  And, five years ago we started to invest in deep learning quite substantially, and we made fundamental changes and enhancements for deep learning across our entire stack of technology from the GPU architecture to the GPU design to the systems that GPUs connect into. For example, NVLink to other systems software that has been designed for it like [Kudi] and [N] and digits to all of the deep learning experts that we have now in our Company. The last five years, we\\'ve quietly invested in deep learning because we believe that the future of deep learning is so impactful to the entire software industry, the entire computer industry that we, if you will, pushed it all-in. Now, we find ourselves at the epicenter of this very important dynamic, and it is probably -- if there is one particular growth factor that is of great significance that would be deep learning. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you for taking my question, and congratulations on good growth and the execution. Jen-Hsun, the first question is tied to PC gaming, very strong trends. I was curious if you could quantify how much of your base has upgraded to Pascal?  And, have you noticed any change in the behavior of gamers in this upgrade cycle?   Whether it\\'s the price or what part of the stack they are buying now?  And, how quickly they are refreshing versus what you might have seen in the Kepler and the Maxwell cycles?  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure.  Thanks a lot, Vivek. Let\\'s see, on PC gaming, there\\'s a few dynamics. Our installed base represents somewhere around 80 million active GeForce users around the world.  And, in fact, only about one-third has even upgraded to Maxwell, and we only started shipping Pascal half of this last quarter. And so, that gives you a sense of how much -- and Pascal is unquestionably the biggest leap we\\'ve ever made generationally in GPUs ever. It is not only high performance, it is also energy efficient, and it includes some really exciting new graphics technologies for VR and others.  I think Pascal is going to be enormously successful for us, and it comes at a time when the PC gaming marketplace is also quite different than the PC gaming market five years ago. \\\\nOne dynamic that\\'s really quite powerful is that the production quality, the production content is much, much higher in video games today than ever.  And, the reason for that -- I\\'ve mentioned several times in previous calls -- is that the installed base of capable game platforms that are architecturally compatible, meaning that PlayStation 4 and Xbox 1 and PCs are essentially architecturally compatible.  And so, the footprint for developers has grown tremendously over previous generations. This is a dynamic that\\'s relatively new.  And so, as a result, the quality of games go up which means that the consumption of GPU capability goes up with it.  I think  we\\'re absolutely seeing that dynamic. I\\'m super-excited about the fact that the Next-Generation game console, the big boost, the 2x boost is coming just around the corner.  That\\'s going to allow game content providers, game developers to aim even higher, and I think that that\\'s going to support long-term expansion of our gross margins and ASPs of PC gaming. \\\\nI would say that there\\'s some other dynamics that are quite powerful as well as you know very well which is eSports is no longer just an interest. E-Sports is a full-force global phenomenon and very powerful in Asia in just about every developing country, and of course, the western world as well.  I think that on top of that, not only is VR off to a great start.  We\\'re seeing some great content now.  But, some of the things that we introduced recently with Pascal, tapping into this grassroots but rather global interest in using video game as an art medium.  We introduced project NVIDIA Ansel which is the world\\'s first in-game photography system.  It allows you to create virtual reality photographs, and it\\'s just really, really amazing.  And so, you could use your video game, capture your amazing moments, share it in VR, or in high resolution with all of your friends.  There\\'s a lot of different ways to enjoy games now, and the production value just continues to go up which is great for our platforms. And so, I think just to summarize your initial question, how much of the installed base has upgraded to Pascal -- very, very small, of course, because we just started production ramp.  But, even then, only one-third has upgraded to Maxwell, and so there\\'s a pretty large, pretty significant upgrade opportunity ahead of us. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Chin. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, thanks for taking my questions.  Jen-Hsun, the first one if I could on the data center competitive landscape. Earlier this week, we saw one of your data center competitors make an acquisition of a smaller private Company, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you view your position in the data center market with respect to machine learning AI?  And also, how your products are positioned from the high end or low end-type of machine learning application performance?   \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, thanks. Well, as you can imagine, we have a good pulse on the state of the industry, and we\\'ve been in this industry since the very beginning.  Deep learning was really ignited when pioneering researchers around the world discovered the use of GPUs to accelerate deep learning and made a practical -- made it even practical to use deep learning as an approach for developing software. The GPU was a perfect match because the nature of the GPU is a sea of small processors, not one big processor, but a whole bunch of small processors.  And, vitally, they\\'re connected by this connecting tissue.  This connecting tissue inside our processor, connecting memory, connecting fabric.  That makes it possible for the processors to communicate with each other all simultaneously. That architectural innovation has been the source of our GPU computing initiative some 10 years ago. That invention has really been groundbreaking. And so, the GPU was really quite a perfect match for deep learning where neural nets are communicating neurons essentially -- inspired by neurons communicating with each other all simultaneously.  And so, the GPU was really quite a perfect match. \\\\nIf you look at deep learning today, five years later, I think that it\\'s a foregone conclusion that deep learning is being infused into just about every single Internet service to make them smarter, more intelligent, more delightful to consumers.  And so, you could see that the hyperscale adoption of deep learning is not only broad, it\\'s large scale and is completely global.  This new computing approach, we realized was going to be quite significant long term and so five years ago we started making quite significant investments across the entire stack of our Company. GPU computing is not just the GPU chip.  It\\'s GPU architecture, it\\'s the GPU design.  It\\'s the GPU system.  All of the algorithms that run on top of it.  All of the tools that run on top of it.  The frameworks -- our collaborations with researchers all over the world.  And so, that collaboration and our investment has improved deep learning on GPUs dramatically in the last two generations when we started this, we were in Kepler.  Maxwell was some 10 times better, and Pascal is some 10 times better than Maxwell.  So, in just two generations, just five years time, we\\'ve improved deep learning by an enormous amount, and the GPU today is very unlike a GPU back in the good old days because of all of the work that we\\'ve done to it.  \\\\nOur strategy -- and this is where we are different not only the focus on the GPU and the expertise in parallel computing, but where we are really different, I would say, is our singular architecture approach to deep learning. We\\'ve essentially put all of our investment behind one architecture. We make this architecture available from hyperscale to data centers to workstations to notebooks to PCs, to cars, to embedded computers, to even a brand new, fully integrated, high performance computer in a box we call DGX, the NVIDIA DGX1.  So, there\\'s so many different ways to gain access to the NVIDIA architecture, the NVIDIA platform for deep learning. \\\\nIt\\'s just literally all over the place, all around you. It\\'s available to you in retail stores and E-tail stores from OEMs in the cloud or even universities all over the world just in embedded computer kits.  So, our approach is quite singular and quite focused, and my sense is that our lead is quite substantial, and our position is very good.  But, we are not sitting on our laurels as you can tell, and for the last five years, we\\'ve been investing quite significantly.  And so, over the next several years, I think you\\'re going to continue to see quite significant jumps from us as we continue to advance in this area. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Romit Shah. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRomit Shah,  Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. - Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thank you. I had a question on automotive. You mentioned that drive PX is now shipping to 80 car companies. Jen-Hsun, I\\'m curious, are the wins here similar in size and focused more on prototyping?  Or, are there opportunities here that could ultimately translate into full production wins and drive the automotive business disproportionately? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, I appreciate the question. Yes, we\\'ve just started this quarter shipping drive PX2.  Before I answer your question, let me tell you what drive PX2 is. Drive PX2, of course, is a processor. It\\'s the drive PX2 version with just one single processor with just Parker and our Tegra processor.  And, optionally, with discrete GPUs, you could build a car with auto-pilot capability or an AI co-pilot capability all the way to self-driving car capability. And, it was able to do sensor fusion.  It was able to do SLAM, which is localization and mapping.  Detection, using deep neural nets of the environment.  In a surround matter, all of the cameras around the car, all feeding into the processor.  And, the drive PX processor doing realtime inferencing of surround cameras.  All the way to the actual planning and driving of the car -- all done in this one car computer, this one car AI super computer. \\\\nAnd so, this quarter, we started them shipping to all of our partners and developers so that they can start developing their software and their systems around our computer and on top of our software stack. We have the intentions of shipping in volume production many of these, and it\\'s hard to know exactly what everybody\\'s schedule is.  But, it ranges everything from very soon to the next couple of years. And, developing a self-driving car is no -- it\\'s a fairly significant undertaking.  Nobody does it for fun surely, and the question is maybe if I could frame the question just slightly differently, do I expect people to be building OEM cars? Or, do we expect them to be building shuttles that are maybe geofenced? Do we expect them to be building trucks? And, you know how many trucks are on the road and how much of the world\\'s economy is built around trucking products all over the world to services of basically taxi as a service. The answer is that we\\'re working with customers and partners across that entire range from cars that are sold to trucks to vans to shuttles to services. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Ellis,  B. Riley & Co. - Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thanks for taking the question. The first is just a follow-up on some of the gaming strength in the quarter with the Company launching the Founders addition availability of gaming products in the quarter.  Can you talk about how that went?  And, for those products, how gross margins compare to just chip bait sales that would go into a gaming card OEM?   \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, first of all Founders edition -- I appreciate you asking that. Founders edition is engineered by NVIDIA, completely built by NVIDIA, and sold directly by NVIDIA and supported by NVIDIA. There\\'s some people that -- some gamers and customers who would prefer to have a direct relationship with our Company. It\\'s availability is limited, and it\\'s engineered just at the highest possible level of quality.  And, we limit the production of it. The reason for that is because we have a network of partners who are much, much more able to take the NVIDIA architecture to every corner of the world literally overnight. We have a fair number of partners who blanket every single country on the planet as we know, and they can provide them in different sizes and shapes and styles and different thermal solutions and different configurations and different price points.  I think we believe that that diversity is one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GeForce platform is so popular, and it creates a lot of excitement in the marketplace and a lot of interesting and different diversified designs. So, I think those two strategies are harmonious with each other.  But, the key point is we built the Founders edition really as a way for some customers to be able to purchase directly and have a relationship directly with us.  But, largely, our strategy is to go to the market with a network of partners. As for gross margins, [the margins are the same]. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, good afternoon. Thank you. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to ask a couple questions again on the data center business. The first being, we\\'ve done a little bit of work trying to estimate in our team what the long-term server attach rate for accelerators in general could be and for GPUs within that.  So, it would be really interesting to hear your perspectives on that?  And then, secondly, is there a market there for an APU-type product in the data center? I know you have project Denver and some other things going on from the CPU perspective, but is there a deep learning integrated CPU/GPU play that might open up more TAM long term for your Company that you are considering pursuing?  Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. Yes, first of all, the type of work loads in the data center has really changed. Back in the good old days, it largely ran database searches, but that has changed so much. It\\'s no longer just about text. It\\'s no longer just about data. The vast majority of what\\'s going through the internet and what\\'s going through data centers today as you know very well are images.  They are voice.  They are increasingly and probably one of the most important new data formats is live video. \\\\nLive video, if you think about it for just a moment, it\\'s live video.  So, it doesn\\'t stay in the server, and it doesn\\'t get recorded which means that if you want to enjoy that live video there needs to be a fair amount of artificial intelligence capability in the data center that\\'s running realtime on their live video so that the person that might be interested the video stream that you\\'re streaming knows who to alert and who to invite to come and watch the live video.  And so, if you think about data center traffic going forward, my sense is that the workload is going to continue to be increasingly high throughput, increasingly high multimedia content, and increasingly, of course, powered by AI and powered by deep learning.  And so, I think that\\'s number one. \\\\nThe second is that the architecture of the data center is recognizably, understandably changing because the workload is changing. Deep learning is a very different workload than the workload of the past, and so the architecture -- it\\'s a new computing model.  It recognized it needs a new computing architecture, and accelerators like GPUs are really well -- a good fit. So, now the other question is how much. It\\'s hard to say. It\\'s hard to say how much.  But, my sense is that it going to be alive, and without any predictions, it\\'s going to be a lot more than we currently ship.  I think the growth opportunity for deep learning is quite significant. I think every hyperscale data center will be GPU-accelerated. It will be GPU-accelerated for training and GPU-accelerated for inferencing.  There may be other approaches, but I think using GPUs is going to be a very large part of that.  \\\\nAnd then, lastly, APUs. I guess my sense is for data centers, energy efficiency is such a vital part and although the work load is increasingly AI and increasingly live video and multimedia where GPUs can add a lot of value. There\\'s still a lot of workload that is CPU-centric, and you still want to have an extraordinary CPU.  I don\\'t think anybody would argue that Intel makes the world\\'s best CPUs. It\\'s not even close.  There\\'s not even a close second, and so I think the artfulness of and the craftsman ship of Intel CPUs is pretty hard to deny.  For most data centers, if you have CPU workloads anyway, I think Intel\\'s Xeons are hard to beat, and so that\\'s my opinion anyway. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Ian Ing. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thank you. Earlier you talked about taping out all of the Pascal products at this point. Are you with three products in the market, are you ceding the sub-$250 price point for cards to competition?  Or, is this something you can serve with older Maxwell product or some upcoming product? Thanks. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks a lot, Ian. We have taped out.  We have verified.  We have ramped every Pascal GPU.  That\\'s right.   However, we have not introduced every one. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteve  Smigie,  Raymond James - Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat, thanks a lot for the question. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on virtual reality.   You had talked a little bit about investments there.  I was just curious what reception you\\'re getting at this point, and what\\'s going to be in your mind the biggest driver getting that going?  Is it more headsets?  Or, more developers working on that?  Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, Steve. I think it\\'s all of that. We have to keep pushing VR and get the head mounts out to the world. I think ACC Vive -- they\\'re doing a great job.  Oculus is doing a great job.  We track very carefully all of the head mounts that are going out there, and it\\'s growing all time. Second, the content is really cool and people are really enjoying it.  And so, we\\'ve just got to get more content, and developers all over the world are jumping on to VR. It really is a great new experience.  But, it\\'s not just games as you know. One of the areas where we have a lot of success, and we see a lot of excitement is in enterprise and industrial design, in medicine, medical imaging, and architectural engineering. \\\\nWe use it ourselves. We are doing a fair amount of design of our workspace, and we render everything using our photo realistic renderer called Iray, fully accelerated by our GPUs.  And then, we render it into VR, and we enjoy it, enjoy it completely in VR.  And, it\\'s something else to be inside an environment that\\'s photo-realistic to be rendered and completely enjoying in VR.  So, architectural engineering and construction is going to benefit from that. So, we see a lot of broad-based adoption of VR. \\\\nNow, one of the things that we did which was really spectacular is the multi-resolution, multi-projection renderings of Pascal. It\\'s the world\\'s first GPU architecture that has the ability to render into multiple projections simultaneously instead of just one, and the reason for that is because the GPU back in the good old days was designed for displaying into one display. You have one keyboard.  You have one display.  But, that mode of computer graphics has really changed as we moved into the world of virtual reality and all kinds of interesting different display configurations and display types.  And so, multi-projection was a revolutionary approach to graphics, and Pascal introduced it.  You really benefit in VR.  \\\\nThe second thing that we did was we integrated physics -- real world physics simulation into VR. The benefit is that without the laws of physics, as you know, you can\\'t feel anything. Things don\\'t collide. Things don\\'t bounce. When you pick up something, you don\\'t feel the haptics of it. We made the entire environment physically simulated,  and so as a result, you feel the entire environment.  When you tip a bottle of water over, it behaves like a bottle of water tipped over.  Balls behave the way balls behave, and things don\\'t merge into each other.  That integration with haptics has completely revolutionized VR, we believe, and that\\'s physics simulation is another thing. And so, I think our position in VR is really quite great, and I\\'m super-enthusiastic about the development of VR. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities - Analyst    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi.  Just on the data center side.  Jen-Hsun, you mentioned three key segments, HBC, grid, and deep learning. What percent of mix are those for the data center? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI would say it\\'s about 50% deep learning at the moment, and probably, call it, 35% -- one third is high performance computing.  Maybe more than that.  And, the rest of it is virtualization.  Going forward, which is part of your question, my sense is that deep learning would become a very significant part of that. The other thing to realize is that deep learning is not just for internet Service Providers for voice recognition and image recognition and face recognition and such. Deep learning is a way of using mathematics, using software to discover insight in a huge amount of data. And, the one place where we generate a huge amount of data is high-performance computing. Every single super computing center in the world is going to be moving towards deep learning, and the reason for that is because they generate a huge amount of data that they really have very little ability to comb through -- to sort through.  And now, with deep learning, they could discover really, really subtle insights in data that is hyper-dimensional.  That\\'s the way to think about deep learning is it\\'s really mathematics.  It\\'s a new form of mathematics that is very, very powerful.  It\\'s a new approach to software.  But, don\\'t think of it as a market. I think every market is going to be a deep learning market. Every application is going to be a deep learning application, and every piece of software will be infused by AI long term. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGood afternoon. Solid job on the quarterly execution. You guys had really good growth in professional visualization, record revenues. I would have thought that most of the growth was being driven by the upcoming release of the Pascal based P5000 and P6000 family.  So I was sort pleasantly surprised that most of the demand was driven by your current generation M6000 family, which means obviously that the Pascal demand cycle is still ahead of you. Number one, is that a fair view?  And then what\\'s driving the strong adoption of M6000, and if you haven\\'t already released it, when do you expect to launch the Pascal-based 5000 and 6000 family?  Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes.  Thanks, Harlan.  I appreciate the question. The team\\'s been working really hard over the years to really change the way that computer aided design is done. Your observation is absolutely right, and it\\'s coming from several different places. First of all, more and more of design is really about product design, industrial design, where the feeling of the product, the aesthetics of the product is just as important as the mechanical design of the product.  And whether you\\'re talking about a building or just a consumer product or a car, we need to be able to simulate the aesthetics of it in a photo realistic way, using real material simulations. The computational load necessary to do that is just really quite extraordinary.  And we\\'re now seeing one design package after another, whether it\\'s [DeSo\\'s] leading packages, Solid Work\\'s leading packages, AutoDesk, Adobe the amount of GPU use has really, really increased and it\\'s increasing quite dramatically. \\\\nI think partly because, finally for all of the ISVs, of all the developers, not only is the market demand for earlier views of photo realistic designs an important decision criteria. They can also rely on the fact that great GPUs are available in just about every computer.  And so the pervasiveness of GPUs allows them to take advantage of the GPUs and to really trust that the software capabilities that they put into their packages, if they rely on GPUs, will have the benefits of GPUs there.  \\\\nAnd so I think that\\'s the virtual cycle you\\'re starting to see in design.  And so the investment that we made in the photo realistic renderings several years ago, the GPU acceleration of optics, this layer for path tracing that is used by just about every software package in the world, our continued evangelism of GPUs and its general purpose use, from computer graphics all the way to imaging, is something that I think is starting to see benefits. That\\'s number one. \\\\nNumber two, Maxwell was the most energy efficient GPU ever made, until {Pascal. Maxwell was twice the energy efficiency of Kepler, and the amazing thing is that Pascal is twice the energy efficiency of Maxwell. But Maxwell made it possible for cinema-like designs in laptops and more elegant workstations and the ability to put more horsepower, more capability into any workstation because of power concerns. Maxwell made it possible for the entire industry to uplift the level of GPU that it uses.  \\\\nAnd I think that going forward, your last question is going forward, do we see -- how do we see Pascal? Pascal is in the process of ramping into workstations all over the world.  And so I think in the coming quarters, we\\'re going to expect to see Pascal out there.  And my expectation is that the dynamics that I just described, which is software developers using more photo realistic capabilities, our inventioning of GPU accelerated photo rendering, I-ray and optics and NDL material description language, and then lastly, the energy efficiency of GPUs, those three factors combined is going to be  really helpful for workstations, and then last, VR. VR is coming, and in order to really enjoy these type of applications for design, you\\'re going to need a pretty powerful GPU at this point. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, guys.  Thanks for letting me ask a question.  A couple for you, Jen-Hsun, on the automotive side. I guess the first part would be, we\\'ve seen in the recent months some partnerships being formed with some of your competitors and some of your customers, and we\\'ve seen some of those partnerships actually dissolve.   So how does NVIDIA play in this general ecosystem in forming partnerships or not?  And then the second part, if we put even just a rough year on it, when would you think the autonomous driving part of your automotive business would actually exceed the infotainment size of your automotive business? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thanks a lot, Ross. Well, we play in a graceful, friendly and open way.  And I mean that rather seriously. We believe this. We believe that building an autonomous self-driving car is a pile of software and it\\'s really complicated software. It\\'s really, really complicated software and it\\'s not like one company is going to do it. And it\\'s also not logical that large, great companies who are refining their algorithms and the capabilities of their self-driving cars over the course of the next two decades can outsource to someone the self-driving car stack. We\\'ve always felt that self-driving cars is a software problem and that large companies need to be able to own their own destiny.  And that\\'s the reason why PX2 is an open stack.  And it\\'s an open platform.  So that every car company can build their self-driving car on top of it. Number one.  \\\\nNumber two, the DRIVE PX2 architecture is scalable.  And the reason for that is because automatic braking and auto pilot on a highway and a virtual co-pilot and a completely autonomous self-driving car, a self-driving truck, a geofenced autonomous shuttle, all of these, a completely autonomous taxi, all of these platforms cannot be solved by one chip. It\\'s just not even logical. The computation necessary to do it is so diverse. The more digits of accuracy or the more digits of precision towards safety that you would like to have in dealing with all of the unexpected circumstances, the more nines you would like to have, if you will, the more computation you have to do. Just as voice recognition, the amount of computation necessary for voice recognition over the last just four or five years has increased by 100 times.  But notice how precise and how accurate voice recognition has become.  And image recognition, video circumstance recognition, context recognition, all of that is going to require just an enormous amount of computation.  So we believe that scalable platforms is necessary, number two.  \\\\nAnd then number three. Detection, computer vision and detection, object detection, is just one tiny sliver of the entire autonomous driving problem. It\\'s just one tiny sliver.  And we\\'ve always said that autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, is really a AI computing problem. It\\'s a computing problem because the processors needs not just detection, but also computation, the CPU matters, the GPU matters, the entire system architecture matters, and so the entire computation engine matters. \\\\nNumber two computation is -- computing is not just a chip problem. It\\'s largely a software problem. And the body of software necessary for the entire system software stack, if you would, the operating system of a self-driving realtime computer, realtime super computer doesn\\'t exist. Most super computers are best effort super computers. They run a job as fast as they can until they\\'re done. But that\\'s not good enough for self-driving cars. This super computer has to run in real time and it has to react at the moment that it sees that there\\'s danger in the way, and best effort doesn\\'t cut it. You need it to be a real time super computer.  And the world has never built a real time super computer before and that\\'s what DRIVE PX2 is all about, a real time super computer for some round, autonomous AI.  \\\\nAnd so that\\'s the focus that we have. That\\'s the direction that we\\'ve taken.  And I think what you\\'re seeing is that the market is starting to react to that. That maybe as they go further and further into autonomous driving, that they\\'re discovering that the problems are related to the type of problems that we\\'re seeing and that\\'s the reason why DRIVE PX is a computer, not a smart camera. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat.  Thank you so much. You talk about deep learning in the hyperscale environment, but it seems like you\\'re getting some traction as well in the enterprise environment.  I know at least one IT department that we\\'ve talked to has been doing some implementation. Can you talk about your progress there and what does it take for you to build that presence within more traditional enterprises? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, as you know, deep learning is not just a internet service approach. Deep learning is really machine learning super charged. And deep learning is really about discovering insight in big data, in big unstructured data, in multi-dimensional data.  And that\\'s what deep learning, that\\'s what I\\'ve called it Thor\\'s hammer that fell from the sky.  And it\\'s amazing technology that these researchers discovered.  And we were incredibly, incredibly well prepared, because GPUs is naturally parallel. And we put us in a position to really be able to contribute to this new computing revolution. \\\\nBut when you think about it in the context that it\\'s just, it\\'s software development, it\\'s a new method of doing software and it\\'s a new way of discovering insight from data, what company wouldn\\'t need it? So every medical, every life sciences company needs it. Every health care company needs it. Every energy discovery company needs it. Every E-tail, retail company needs it. Everybody has lots of data. Everybody has lots and lots of data that they own themselves. Every manufacturing company needs it. Every company that cares about security, every company that deals with a massive amount of customer data has the benefit, can benefit from deep learning.  And so when you frame it in that context, I think I would say that deep learning\\'s market opportunity is even greater in enterprises than it is in consumer internet services.  \\\\nAnd that\\'s exactly the reason why we built the NVIDIA DTX1.  Because most of these Enterprises don\\'t have the expertise or simply don\\'t have the willpower to want to build a super computing data center or a high performance computer. They would rather buy an appliance, if you will, with all of the software integrated and the performance incredibly well tuned, and it comes out of a box.  And that\\'s essentially what NVIDIA DGX1 is.  It\\'s a super computer in a box and  it\\'s designed and tuned for high performance computing for deep learning. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHello.  Thank you very much for squeezing me in. I had one question on gross margin, Jen-Hsun. Very big top line guidance, but yet gross margin is guided to flat. What is the reason?  And I understand it\\'s not always perfectly correlated, margins should be going up that much, but is it pricing, is it yield? Because the mix also seems to be moving in the right direction, more [Pro Ves], more HPC and less of the OEM business. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, our guidance is our best estimate.  And we\\'ll know how everything turns out next quarter when we talk again.  But at some high level, I would agree with you that as we move further and further and more and more into our platform approach of business, where our platform is specialized and rich with software, that increasingly the value of the product that we bring has extraordinary enterprise value, that the benefits of using it is not just measured in frames per second but real TCO for companies and real cost savings as they reduce the number of server clusters, and real increases and real boosts in their productivity.  And so I think there\\'s every reason to believe that long term, this platform approach can drive greater value.  But as for the next quarter, I think let\\'s just wait and see how it goes. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRajvindra Gill,  Needham & Company - Analyst    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIt\\'s Vindra.  How are you? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRajvindra Gill,  Needham & Company - Analyst    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nExactly. Good. A question, Jen-Hsun, on the DRIVE PX2. So my understanding, as you described it, it\\'s one scalable architecture from the cockpit to ADAS to mapping to autonomous driving.  But I\\'m curious to see how that compares to the approach that some of your competitors are taking with respect to providing different solutions for different levels of the ADAS systems, whether it\\'s level one, level two, level three, specifically with the V2x communication where, for level four autonomous driving, where you\\'re going to need 6 to 20 different radar units, 3 to 6 different cameras, [lidar].  I\\'m trying to square how your approach is different from some of your competitors in the semiconductor space. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, good question. There\\'s no way to square and there\\'s no reason to square, and you aren\\'t going to find one answer.  And the reason why you aren\\'t going to find one answer is because nobody knows exactly how to get it done. We all have intuitions and we all have beliefs about how we\\'re going to be able to ultimately solve the long-term fully autonomous vehicle, that wherever I am, the car I step into, the automotive automobile we step into, is completely autonomous, and that it has AI inside and out, and it\\'s just an incredible experience.  But we aren\\'t there yet.  \\\\nAnd all of these companies have slightly -- not all -- but many companies have slightly different visions of the future. Some people believe that the path to the future is fully autonomous right away in a geofenced area that has been fully mapped in advance. Some people believe that you can use it just for highway auto pilot as a first starting point and work quickly towards fully autonomy, and some people believe the best way to do that is through shuttles and trucks.  So you see a lot of different visions out there.  And I think all of those visions are coming from smart people doing smart things and they\\'re targeting different aspects of transportation. \\\\nI think there\\'s a fallacy that transportation in every single country in every single form is exactly the same. It just doesn\\'t work that way.  And so there\\'s technology insight and then there\\'s market insight, and there\\'s a technology vision versus your entry point.  And I think that\\'s where all of the squaring doesn\\'t happen. So you\\'re solving for a simple equation that won\\'t happen.  However there\\'s one thing that we believe absolutely will happen. We are absolutely certain that AI will be involved in this endeavor, that finally with deep learning and finally with AI that we believe we have the secret sauce necessary to break these puzzles and to solve these puzzles over a period of time.  Number one.  \\\\nNumber two.  We believe unquestionably that depending on the problem you want to solve, you need a different amount of computational capability. We believe unambiguously this is a software problem, and that for the largest of transportation companies, they need to own their own software in collaboration with you, but they aren\\'t going to let you do it and keep it as a black box. We believe unambiguously that this is a computing problem, that this is a real time super computing problem., that it\\'s not just about a special widget, but computation is necessary, processors, a computer system, systems software, and an enormous amount of operating system capability is necessary to build something like this. \\\\nIt is a massive software problem.  Otherwise, we would have done it already.  And so I think you\\'ll see this year the beginnings of a lot of some very visionary and really quite exciting introductions.  But in the next year and the year after that, I think you\\'ll see more and more and more.  I think this is the beginning and we\\'re working with some really, really amazing people to get this done. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitch Steves,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question, guys.   So just circling back to the data center piece and the deep learning aspect, is there a change in ASPs you guys are seeing when you enter that market? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nNo. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitch Steves,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo essentially there\\'s going to be no margin change from the data center sales.  And I guess the same question in automotive, as well. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOh, automotive ASPs for self-driving cars will be much higher than infotainment. It\\'s a much tougher problem. Every car in the world has infotainment. With the exception of some pioneering work or early, the best, the most leading edge cars today, almost no cars are self-driving.  So I think that the technology necessary for self-driving cars is much, much more complicated than lane keeping or adaptive cruise control or first generation, first and second generation ADAS. The problem is much, much more complicated. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Alger. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBrian Alger,  Raymond James - Analyst    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think this will be the first, congrats, actually, on a pretty darn good quarter and amazing guidance. I want to come back to the difference of Pascal versus what would be otherwise competition from either Intel or AMD. There\\'s been a fair amount of documentation talking about the power requirements or the power draw differences between Pascal versus Polaris.  And one would think that while that\\'s important in gaming and it\\'s gotten a lot of notice, it would actually be more important for these deep learning applications that we\\'ve been talking so much about over the past half hour, 45 minutes.  Can you maybe talk to that side of the design, not so much the horsepower, but maybe the power efficiency of it and what that means for when you scale it up into really big problems? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBrian, thank you very much.  First of all, I appreciate your comment. The team worked really, really hard.  And over the last several years, the last five years, all of the employees of NVIDIA have been pursuing a strategy that took until today, really, to show people that it really pays off and it\\'s a very unique business model. It\\'s a very unique approach. But I just want to congratulate all of the employees that have worked so hard to get us here. \\\\nI appreciate the comment also about energy efficiency. In fact, energy efficiency is the single most important feature of processors today and going forward. And the reason for that is because every single environment that we\\'re in is power constrained, every single environment. Even your PC, with 750 watts or 1,000 watts, is power constrained.  Because we could surely put more GPUs in there than 1,000 watts.  And so that\\'s power constrained.  We\\'re in environments where we only have one or two watts. It might be a drone and we need to be, we\\'re completely power constrained, so energy efficiency is really, really important. We might be in a data center where we\\'re doing deep learning and training we\\'re training neuronets or we\\'re inferencing neuronets.  And in this particular case, although the data center has a lot of power to provision, the number of GPUs that they want to use in it is measured in tens, tens and tens of thousands.  And so energy efficiency becomes the predominant issue. Energy efficiency, literally, is the most important feature of the processor. \\\\nNow from there, from there, there are functionality and architectural features, that the architectural changes that we made in Pascal so that we could stay ahead of the deep learning research work and the deep learning progress, was groundbreaking and people are starting to discover the architectural changes that we put into Pascal and it\\'s going to make a huge difference in the next several years of deep learning.  And so that\\'s a feature and an architectural innovation. \\\\nAnd then lastly, of course, there\\'s all of the software that goes on top of the processor base. We call it GPU computing instead of just GPUs, because GPU computing is about computing, it\\'s about software, it\\'s systems, it\\'s about the inner relationship of our GPU with the memories and all of the memories around the system and the networking and the inter connect and storage, and it\\'s a large scale computing problem. It is also the highest throughput computing problem on the planet, which is the reason why we\\'ve been called upon by our nation to build the world\\'s next two fastest super computers. High throughput computing is our company\\'s expertise. High throughput computing from fundamental architecture to chip design to system design to system software to algorithms to computational mathematics, and all of the experts in all the various fields of science, that is the great investment that we made in the last five years.  And I think the results are really starting to show. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Curtis,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHey, guys.  Thanks for squeezing me in here and great execution on the quarter. Two related questions. One, Colette, just curious your view on the use of capital and buybacks.  Obviously, an accelerated one, only $9 million in the last quarter.  What\\'s your view going forward?  \\\\nAnd then Jen-Hsun, maybe a bigger question in terms of ease of capital, whether you could talk about, you said CPU is not an area that you would want to go into, but obviously GPUs have legs.  So just curious, if you look around other areas, maybe in the data center, where you could also add value?  \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thanks, Blayne. The return of capital continues to be an important part of our shareholder value message  But remember, it is still two parts of it. Part of it is still dividends and part of it has been our purchasing of stock. So as we continue to go forward, the dividend is definitely a long term perspective and we\\'ll make sure that we can watch the dividend yield there to stay competitive and also looking at our profitability. Our share repurchase, we\\'ll look at the opportunistic time for those repurchases and making sure that we\\'re also doing that carefully, as well. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd long-term use of capital, I would say this, that what NVIDIA is really rich with is we\\'re rich with vision and creativity and the courage to innovate.  And that\\'s one of the reasons why we start almost every conversation with anything by gathering our great people around the Company and seeing what kind of future we can invent for ourselves and for the world.  And so I think our use of capital is nurturing the employees that we have and providing them the platform to innovate and create the conditions by which they can be successful and do their live\\'s work.  And so that\\'s philosophically where we start. \\\\nWe aren\\'t allergic to acquisitions and purchases, and we look all the time and we have the benefit of working with and partnering with companies large and small all over the world as we move the industry forward.  So we\\'re surely open to that.  But our natural posture is always to invest in our people and invest in our own company\\'s ability to invent the future. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYour next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nC.J. Muse,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGood afternoon. Thank you for squeezing me in. I guess, two quick questions.  The first one, thank you for breaking out deep learning as a percentage of the data center. Can you provide what that percentage was for the April quarter?  And then the follow-up question is if I look back over the last four quarters and I look at your implied guide, you\\'re looking at roughly 50%  incremental operating margin. And curious if that\\'s the right number you would underwrite here, or should we be thinking about improving mix, as well as maturing process and manufacturing at your foundry partners such that that could actually be higher as we look ahead?  Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, deep learning is a software approach, a new computing architecture, a new computing approach that the industry, that researchers have been developing for 20 years.  And it was only until five years ago when pioneer work was done on deep learning and on GPUs that really turbo charged it and gave the industry, if you will, a time machine that brought the future to the present.  And the power of deep learning is so great that this capability is expanding and people are discovering more ways to use it and more applications and new deep learning architectures, and the networks are getting bigger and deeper and more complicated.  And so I think that this area, this area is going to grow quite significantly. It represents a vast majority of our data center revenues recently, and my sense is that it\\'s going to continue to be a significant part of it. \\\\nSo what was the second question?  Did I miss it? I think his question was really about data centers and deep learning, right? What\\'s that? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think your question was regarding deep learning and the percentage of data center and how that has moved. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nC.J. Muse,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, and it\\'s the vast majority. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. Maybe I\\'ll go to the other end of the spectrum and speaking of energy efficiency. Are you finding new opportunities for Tegra, aside from the infotainment in automotive? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin, I appreciate the question. Tegra is at the core of all of our self-driving car initiatives. And so without Tegra, there would be no self-driving cars. So Tegra is the core of our self-driving car initiative, the computing platform for self-driving cars.  And DRIVE PX2 includes Tegra, as well as discrete GPUs of Pascal, but the core of it, the vast majority of the heavy lifting is done by Tegra, and we expect that going forward.  And so Tegra is incredibly important to us. \\\\nTegra is also the core of the processor of Jetson. Jetson is a platform that is designed for other embedded autonomous and intelligent machines.  And so you could imagine what kind of intelligent machines in the future will benefit from deep learning and AI, but robotics and drones and embedded applications inside buildings and cities.  There are all kinds of applications. I\\'m very, very optimistic about the future of Jetson, but at the core of that is also Tegra.  So think of Tegra as our computer on a chip, and it\\'s our AI computer on a chip. \\\\nOkay, may I -- I appreciate all the questions. Thank you all for joining us today. Our growth is really driven by several factors. Our focus on deep learning, self-driving cars, gaming, and VR, markets where GPU has been vital, is really starting to pay off. The second factor is that Pascal is the most advanced GPU ever created and we\\'re incredibly excited about it. And we, this last quarter, we ramped it with enormous success.  And I\\'m so proud of the team for all of the preparation and the executions last quarter.  And the third is hyper scale adoption of deep learning is now widespread, is large scale and we\\'re seeing it globally. Those are the several growth drivers ahead of us. \\\\nAs we go forward, we\\'re also looking to sharing our many developments in deep learning AI with you. We\\'re really just in the beginning of seeing  the actual growth of deep learning as we scale out into the market. Deep learning adoption is now widespread and is ramping at every hyper scale data center. It\\'s a new computing model that requires a new computing architecture, one that GPU is perfectly suited for.  And the thing that we\\'ve done that I\\'m really delighted with is the strategy that started five years ago to optimize our GPU computing platform from end-to-end and optimize it for deep learning, at the processor level, at the architecture level, at the chip design level, systems and software and algorithms and a richness of deep learning experts at the Company, and the collaboration we have all over the world with researchers and developers has made it possible for us to continue to advance this field and this platform.  \\\\nAnd as a result of that our deep learning platform improved far more than anybody would have expected.  If you just projected it based on semiconductor physics, it would be nowhere near the level of speed up and step up that we got from generation to generation, from Kepler to Maxwell, we got 10x, from Maxwell to Pascal, we got another 10x.  And you can surely expect pretty substantial improvements and increases from us over the next several years. \\\\nWhere we really shine is not only as a fantastic platform for deep learning and the training of the networks, but it\\'s also a fantastic platform to scale out. You can enjoy our platform, whether it\\'s in cloud or in data center or in super computers and workstations and desk side PCs and notebook computers to cars to embedded computers, as I mentioned just now with Jetson. This is a one singular architecture approach, so the thoughtfulness and the care of the investment of the developers and the software programmers and researchers is really our preeminent concern.  And as we know, computing is about architecture and computing is about platform, and mostly, computing is about developers.  And we\\'ve been quite thoughtful about the importance it is to developers.  And as a result, developers all over the world, all over the industry, can use this singular architecture and get the benefits of their science and their applications as they scale and deploy their work. \\\\nSo that\\'s it. We had a great quarter and I look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. Thank you all for joining us. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis concludes today\\'s conference call.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Simona. Q4 revenue was $3.11 billion, up 41% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially, well above our outlook, reflecting upside in our data center and gaming businesses. Full year revenue was $10.9 billion, down 7%. We recovered from the excess channel inventory in gaming and an earlier pause in hyperscale spending and exited the year with great momentum.\\\\nStarting with gaming. Revenue of $1.49 billion was up 56% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. Full year gaming revenue was $5.52 billion, down 12% from our prior year.\\\\nWe enjoyed strong end demand for our desktop and notebook GPUs. Let me give you some more details. Our gaming lineup was exceptionally well positioned for the holidays with the unique ray tracing capabilities of our RTX GPUs and incredible performance at every price point. From the Singles Day shopping event in China through the Christmas season in the West, channel demand was strong for our entire stack. Fueling this were new blockbuster games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, continued eSports momentum and new RTX Super products. With RTX price points as low as $299, ray tracing is now the sweet spot for PC gamers.\\\\nGaming is thriving and gamers prefer GeForce. The global phenomenon of eSports keeps gaming momentum with an audience now exceeding 440 million, up over 30% in just 2 years according to Newzoo. The League of Legends World Championship brought more than 100 million viewers, on par with this month\\'s Super Bowl.\\\\nRay tracing titles continue to come to market, and GeForce RTX GPUs are the only ones that support this important technology. This quarter, Wolfenstein: Young blood and Deliver Us The Moon were the latest titles to support ray tracing as well as NVIDIA\\'s Deep Learning Super Sampling technique, which also uses AI to boost performance. With the proliferation of RTX-enabled games and our best ever top-to-bottom performance, we are solidly into the Turing architecture upgrade cycle. Gamers continue to move to higher-end GPUs, seeking better performance and support for ray tracing.\\\\nGaming laptops posted double-digit year-on-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. The category continues to expand, driven by appealing thin and light form factors with fantastic graphics performance. This holiday season, retailers stocked a record 125 gaming laptops based on NVIDIA GPUs, up from 94 last year, with our Max-Q designs up 2x. At CES, we launched the world\\'s first 14-inch GeForce RTX laptop with ASUS. We also continue to expand our Studio lineup of laptops for the fast-growing population of freelance creators, designers and YouTubers with 13 new RTX Studio systems introduced at CES. Powered by Turing GPUs, these systems are optimized for over 55 creative and design applications with RTX accelerated ray tracing and/or AI.\\\\nLast week, we launched our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. Powered by GeForce, GeForce NOW is the first cloud gaming service to deliver ray trace games. It\\'s also the only open platform so gamers can enjoy the games they already have and use their existing store accounts without having to repurchase games. GeForce NOW enables PC games on Macs, Windows, PCs, TVs, Mobile devices and soon, Chromebooks. GFN has a freemium business model that includes 2 membership plans: a free membership with standard access; and a Founders tier with a starting price of $4.99 per month, which gives priority access and RTX ray tracing support.\\\\nOur goal with GeForce NOW is to expand GeForce gaming to more gamers. About 80% of GeForce NOW gamers are playing on underpowered PCs or devices with Mac OS or Android. With GeForce NOW, they are able to enjoy PC gaming on a GeForce GPU in the cloud. GeForce now can expand GeForce well beyond the roughly 200 million gamers we reach today.\\\\nSeparately, we entered into a collaboration with Tencent, the world\\'s largest gaming platform, to bring PC gaming in the cloud to China, the world\\'s largest gaming market. NVIDIA GPU technology will power Tencent\\'s Start cloud gaming service, which is in early testing stages.\\\\nMoving to data center. Revenue was a record $968 million, up 43% year-on-year and up 33% sequentially, our strongest ever sequential growth in dollar terms. Full year fiscal year \\'20 data center revenue was a record $2.98 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Strong growth was fueled by hyperscale and vertical industry end customers. Hyperscale demand was driven by purchases of both our training and inference products in support of key AI workloads, such as natural language understanding, conversational AI and deep recommendators. Hyperscale demand was also driven by cloud computing. AWS now makes the T4 available in every region. This underscores the versatility of the T4, which excels at a wide array of high-performance computing workloads, including AI inference, cloud gaming, rendering and virtual desktop.\\\\nVertical industry growth was driven primarily by consumer Internet companies. Other verticals such as retail, health care and logistics continue to grow from early-stage build-outs with a strong foundation of deep learning engagements, and we see an expanding set of opportunities across high-performance computing, data science and edge computing applications.\\\\nT4, our inference platform, had another strong quarter, with shipments up 4x year-on-year, driven by public cloud deployments as well as edge AI video analytics applications. T4 and V100, reflecting strong demand for inference and training, respectfully, set records this quarter for both shipments and revenue.\\\\nEven as NVIDIA remains the leading platform for AI model training, NVIDIA\\'s inference platform is getting wide use by some of the world\\'s leading enterprise and consumer Internet companies, including American Express, Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter.\\\\nThe industry continues to do groundbreaking AI work for NVIDIA. For example, Microsoft\\'s biggest quality improvements made over the past year in its Bing search engine stem from its use of NVIDIA GPUs and software for training and inference of its natural language understanding models. These DNN transformer models popularized by BERT have computational requirements for training that are in the order of magnitude higher than earlier image-based models. Conversational AI is a major new workload, requiring GPUs for inference to achieve high throughput within the desired low latency. Indeed, Microsoft cited an inference throughput increase of up to 800x on NVIDIA GPUs compared with CPUs, enabling it to serve over 1 million BERT inferences per second worldwide. And just this week, Microsoft researchers announced a new breakthrough in natural language processing with the largest ever publicized model trained on NVIDIA DGX-2. This advances the state of the art for AI assistance in tasks, such as answering questions, summarization and natural language generation.\\\\nRecommendators are also an important machine learning model for the Internet, powering billions of queries per second. The industry is moving to deep recommendators such as wide and deep model, which leverage deep learning to enable automatic feature learning and to support unstructured content. Running these models on GPUs can dramatically increase inference throughput and reduce latency compared with CPUs. For example, Alibaba\\'s and Baidu\\'s recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI, boosting their inference throughput by orders of magnitudes beyond CPUs. Deep recommendators enabled Alibaba to achieve 10% increase in click-through rates.\\\\nWe also announced the availability of a new GPU-accelerated supercomputer on Microsoft Azure. It enables customers for the first time to rent an entire AI supercomputer on demand from their desk, matching the capabilities of large on-premise supercomputers that can take months to deploy. And in Europe, energy company Eni announced the world\\'s fastest industrial supercomputer based on NVIDIA GPUs.\\\\nAI has even come to pizza delivery. At the National Retail Federation\\'s Annual Conference last month, we announced Domino\\'s as a customer deploying our platform for deep learning and data science applications, helping with customer engagement and order accuracy prediction. More broadly in retail, we have seen a significant increase in the adoption of NVIDIA\\'s edge computing offerings by large retailers for powering AI applications that reduce shrinkage, optimize logistics and create operational efficiencies.\\\\nAt the SC19 Supercomputing conference, we introduced a reference design platform for GPU-accelerated ARM-based servers, along with ecosystem partners, ARM, Ampere Computing, Fujitsu and Marvell. We made available our ARM-compatible software development kit consisting of NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries and development tools for accelerating computing. This opens the floodgates of innovation to support growing new applications from hyperscale cloud to Exascale supercomputing. We also introduced NVIDIA Magnum IO, a suite of software optimized to eliminate storage and input/output bottlenecks. Magnum IO delivers up to 20x faster data processing for multi-server, multi-GPU computing nodes when working with massive data sets to carry out complex financial analysis, climate modeling and other workloads for data scientists, high-performance computing and AI researchers.\\\\nFinally, we introduced TensorRT 7, the seventh generation of our inference software development kit, which speeds up components of conversational AI by 10x comparing to running on CPUs. This helps drive latency below the 300 millisecond threshold considered necessary for real-time interactions supporting our growth in conversational AI.\\\\nMoving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $331 million, up 13% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially. Full year revenue was a record $1.21 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. ProVis accelerated in Q4 as the rollout of more RTX-enabled applications is driving strong upgrade cycle for our Turing GPUs. RTX is also opening up new market segment opportunities, such as rendering and studio for freelance creatives.\\\\nIn November, V-ray, Arnold and Blender software renderers began shipping with RTX technology. These joined our leading creative and design applications, including Premier Pro, Dimension, SOLIDWORKS, CATIA and Maya. With RTX, these applications enable enhanced creativity and notable productivity gains. In Blender Cycles, for example, real-time rendering performance is boosted 4x versus a CPU. RTX is now supported by more than 40 leading creative and design applications, reaching a combined user base of over 40 million.\\\\nFinally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $163 million, flat from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. Full year revenue reached a record $700 million, up 9% year-on-year. During the quarter, we announced DRIVE AGX Orin, the next-generation platform for autonomous vehicles and robots, powered by our new Orin SoC and delivering nearly 7x the performance of the previous generation Xavier SoC. The platform scales from level 2 plus AI-assisted driving up to level 5 fully driverless operation. Orin is software-defined and compatible with Xavier, allowing developers to leverage their investment across multiple product generations.\\\\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 64.9% and non-GAAP was 65.4%, up sequentially, largely reflecting a higher contribution of data center products. Q4 GAAP operating expenses were $1.02 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $810 million, up 12% and 7% year-on-year, respectively.\\\\nQ4 GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 66% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.89, up 136% from a year ago. Q4 cash from operations was $1.46 billion. Fiscal year \\'20 cash flow from operations was a record $4.76 billion.\\\\nWith that, let me turn the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The outlook does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox. We are engaged and progressing with China on the regulatory approval and believe the acquisition will likely close in the first part of calendar 2020.\\\\nBefore we get to the new -- the numbers, let me comment on the impact of the coronavirus. While it is still early and the ultimate effect is difficult to estimate, we have reduced our Q1 revenue outlook by $100 million to account for the potential impact. We expect revenue to be $3 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65% and 65.4%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.05 billion and $835 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $170 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on the IR website.\\\\nIn closing, let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on March 2 in San Francisco.\\\\nWith that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions)\\\\nAnd our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess on data center, Colette or Jensen, can you speak to some of the areas that drove the upside in the quarter? You talked about inference and -- both the T4 and the V100 having record quarters but relative to your internal expectations, what were some of the businesses that drove the upside? And if you can also speak to the breadth of your customer profile today relative to a couple of years ago, how that\\'s expanded, that would be helpful as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Toshiya, thanks a lot for your question. The primary driver for our growth is AI. There are 4 fundamental dynamics. The first is that the AI models that are being created are achieving breakthroughs and quite amazing breakthroughs, in fact, in natural language understanding, in conversational AI, in recommendation systems. And you know this, but for the others in the audience, recommendation systems are essentially the engine of the Internet today. And the reason for that is because there are so many items in the world, whether it\\'s a store or whether it\\'s content or websites or information you are querying, there are hundreds of billions, trillions, and depending on how you count it, hundreds of trillions of items in the world. And there are billions of people, each with their own characteristics and their countless contexts. And between the items, the people, the users and the various contexts that we\\'re in, location and what you\\'re looking for and weather or what\\'s happening in the environment, those kind of contexts affects the search query that -- the answer they provide you. The recommendation system is just foundational now to search. And some people have said this is the end of search and the beginning  -- and the era of recommendation systems. Work is being done everywhere around the world in advancing recommendation systems. And very first time over the last year, it\\'s been able to be done in deep learning.\\\\nAnd so the first thing is just the breakthroughs in AI. The second is production AI, which means that whereas we had significant and we continue to have significant opportunities in training because the models are getting larger, and there are more of them, we\\'re seeing a lot of these models going into production, and that business is called inference. Inference, as Colette mentioned, grew 4x year-over-year. It\\'s a substantial part of our business now. But one of the interesting statistics is TensorRT 7, the entire TensorRT download this year was about 500,000, a doubling over a year ago. What most people don\\'t understand about inference is it\\'s an incredibly complex computational problem, but it\\'s an enormously complex software problem. And so the second dynamic is moving from training or growing from training and models going into production called inference.\\\\nThe third is the growth, not just in hyperscale anymore, but in public cloud and in vertical industries. Public cloud because of thousands of AI start-ups that are now developing AI software in the cloud. And the OpEx model works much better for them as they\\'re younger. When they become larger, they could decide to build their own data center infrastructure on-prem, but the thousands of start-ups start their lives in the cloud.\\\\nWe\\'re also seeing really great success in verticals. One of the most exciting vertical is logistics. Logistics, retail, warehousing. We announced, I think, this quarter or last -- end of last quarter, USPS, American Express, Walmart, just large companies who have enormous amounts of data that they\\'re trying to do data analytics on and do predictive analytics on. And so the third dynamic is the growth in -- beyond hyperscale and public cloud as well as vertical industries.\\\\nAnd then the last dynamic is being talked about a lot, and this is really, really exciting, and it\\'s called edge AI. We used to call it industries and AI where the action is. But the industry now calls edge AI. We\\'re seeing a lot of excitement there. And the reason for that is you need to have low latency inference. You might not be able to stream the data all the way to the cloud for cost reasons or data sovereignty reasons, and you need the response time. And so those 4 dynamics around AI really drove our growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Just following up on that. As you look back at the last 12 months and the deceleration that you saw in your HPC cloud business, now that you have the perspective of seeing what\\'s driving the rebound, any thoughts on what drove it to slow down in the first place? Was it just digestion? Was it sort of a handoff from image recognition to these newer applications that you just talked about? Just help us -- what happened there? And I guess as it pertains to the future, do we think of this as a business that will have that kind of lumpiness to it?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. That\\'s a really good question. In fact, if you look backwards, now we only have the benefit of history. The deep recommendation systems, the natural language understanding breakthroughs, the conversational AI breakthroughs, all happened in this last year. And the velocity by which the industry captured the benefits here and continue to evolve and advance from these what so-called transformer models was really quite incredible. And so all of a sudden, the number of breakthroughs in AI has just grown tremendously, and these models have grown tremendously. Just this last week, Microsoft announced that they\\'ve trained a neural net model in collaboration with work that we did, we call Megatron, increased the size of a model from 7.5 billion parameters to 17.5 billion parameters. And the accuracy of their natural language understanding has just -- has really been boosted.\\\\nAnd so the models are -- AI is finding really fantastic breakthroughs, and models are getting bigger and there are more of them. And when you look back and look at when these breakthroughs happened, it essentially happened this last year.\\\\nThe second, we\\'ve been working on inference for some time. And until this last year, very few of those inference models went into production. And now we have deep learning models across all of the hyperscalers in production. And this last year, we saw really great growth in inference.\\\\nThe third dynamic is public clouds. All these AI startups that are being started all over the world, there\\'s about 6,000 of them, they\\'re starting to develop and be able to put their models into production. And with the scale out of AWS, we now have T4s in every single geography. So the combination of the availability of our GPUs in the cloud, and the startups and vertical industries deploying their AI models into production, the combination of all that just kind of came together. And all of that happened this last year. And as a result, we had record sales of V100s and T4s. And so we\\'re quite excited with the developments, and it\\'s all really powered by AI.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on returning the business back to the strong growth. Jensen, I wanted to ask about how you are positioned from a supply perspective for this coming year? Your main foundry is running pretty tight. How will you be able to support the 20% or so growth here that many investors are looking for? If you could just give us some commentary on how you\\'re positioned from a supply perspective, that will be very helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, I think we\\'re in pretty good shape on supply. We surely won\\'t have ample supply. It is true that the industry is tight and the combination of supporting multiple processes, multiple fabs across our partner, TSMC. We\\'ve got a lot of different factories and a lot of different -- several different nodes of process qualified. I think we\\'re in good shape. And so we just have to watch it closely. And we\\'re working very closely with all of our customers in forecasting. And of course, that gives us better visibility as well and -- but all of us have to do a better job forecasting, and we\\'re working very closely between our customers and our foundry partners, TSMC.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Colette, I\\'m wondering if you can give us -- in data center, if you can give us a little idea of what the mix was between industries and hyperscale. I think last quarter, hyperscale was a little bit less than 50%. Can you give us maybe the mix or how much it was up, something like that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Tim, thanks for the question. Similar to what we had seen last quarter, with all things growing as we moved into this quarter, growth in terms of the hyperscales, continued expansion in terms of those vertical industries and even in the cloud instances. We\\'re still looking at around the same split of 50-50 between our hyperscales and our vertical industries and maybe a little bit tad below 50 in terms of our total overall hyperscales.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the results. When I look at the numbers, the growth on an absolute basis sequentially in data center was almost 2x or north of 2x, what we\\'ve seen in the past as far as the absolute sequential change. Through the course of this quarter, you were pretty clear that you would expect to see an acceleration of growth in the December quarter. I\\'m just curious of how you think about that going into the April quarter? And how we should think about that growth rate through the course of this year? If you can give us any kind of framework.\\\\nAnd Jensen, just curious, I mean, as you think about the bigger picture, where do you think we stand from an industry perspective today in terms of the amount or the attach rate of GPUs, is it for acceleration in the server market? And where do you think that might be looking out over the next 3 years or so?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Aaron. Colette, do you want to go first?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. When we think about going into Q1 and our data center overall growth, we do expect to see continued growth, both going into Q1. We believe our visibility still remains positive quite well, and we\\'re expecting that as we move into it and go forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Aaron, I believe that every query on the Internet will be accelerated someday. And at the very core of it, most -- almost all queries will have some natural language understanding component to it. Almost all queries will have to sort through and make a recommendation from the trillions of possibilities, filter it down and recommend a handful of recommended answers to your queries. Whether it\\'s shopping or movies or just asking locations or even asking a question, the number of the possibilities of all the answers versus what is best answer is -- needs to be filtered down. And that filtering process is called recommendation. That recommendation system is really complex, and deep learning is going to be involved in all that. That\\'s the first thing. I believe that every query will be accelerated.\\\\nThe second is, as you know, CPU scaling has really slowed, and there\\'s just no two ways about it. It\\'s not a marketing thing. It\\'s a physics thing. And the ability for CPUs to continue to scale without increasing cost or increasing power has ended. And it\\'s called the end of Dennard scaling. And so there has to be another approach. The combination of the emergence of deep learning and the use of artificial intelligence and the amount of computation that\\'s necessary to -- for every single query but the benefit that comes along with that, and the end of Dennard scaling, suggests that there needs to be another approach, and we believe that approach is acceleration.\\\\nNow our approach for acceleration is fundamentally different than an accelerator. Notice, we never say accelerator, we say accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because we believe that a software-defined data center will have all kinds of different AIs. The AIs will continue to evolve, the models will continue to evolve and get larger, and a software-defined data center needs to be programmable. It is one of the reasons why we\\'ve been so successful. And if you go back and think about all the questions that have been asked of me over the last 3 or 4 years around this area, the consistency of the answer has to do with the programmability of architecture, the richness of the software, the difficulties of the compilers, the ever-growing size of the models, the diversity of the models and the advances that these models are creating. And so we\\'re seeing the beginning of a new computing era.\\\\nAnd a fixed function accelerator is simply not the right answer. And so we believe that the future is going to be accelerated. It\\'s going to require an accelerated computing platform, and software richness is really vital, so that these data centers could be software defined. And so I think that we\\'re in the early innings, the early innings, very, very early innings of this new future. And I think that accelerated computing is going to become more and more important.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Obviously, congratulations on the data center success. I wanted to ask a little bit, Colette, about the -- you took $100 million out for coronavirus, and I wanted to ask a little bit about how you got to that number. Really 2 pieces. One, if you could remind us maybe in terms of units or revenue, how -- what percentage of your gaming business is within China? And as you look at that $100 million that you pulled out of the guidance, are you thinking about that from a demand disruption perspective? Or are you thinking about it from something in the supply chain that might limit your sales?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thanks for the question, Matt. So it\\'s really still quite early in terms of trying to figure out what the impact from the overall coronavirus may be. So we\\'re not necessarily precise in terms of our estimate. Yes, our estimates are split between an impact possibly on gaming and data center and split pretty much equally. The $100 million also reflects what may be supply challenges or may be overall demand. But we\\'re still looking at those to get a better understanding where we think that might be.\\\\nIn terms of our business and our business makeup, yes, our overall China business for gaming is an important piece. We have about 30% of our overall China gaming as a percentage of our overall gaming business. For data center, it\\'s -- it moves quite a bit. They are a very important market for us, but it moves from quarter-to-quarter just based on the overall end customer mix as well as the system builds that they may choose. So it\\'s a little harder to determine.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the strong results and guidance. On gaming -- yes, no problem. Good to see the recent launch of your GeForce NOW service. But on the partnership with Tencent on cloud gaming, seems like Tencent should have a smoother transition to the cloud model. They are the largest gaming company in the world, so they own many of the games. They also have their own data center infrastructure already in place. But how is the NVIDIA team going to be supporting this partnership? Is it going to be [deal your] GeForce NOW hardware framework? Or will you just be supporting them with your standalone GPU products? And when do you expect the service to go mainstream?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let\\'s see. Tencent is the world\\'s largest publisher. China represents about 1/3 of the world\\'s gaming, and transitioning to the cloud is going to be a long-term journey. And the reason for that is because Internet connection is not consistent throughout the entire market. And a lot of application still needs to be onboarded, and we\\'re working very closely with them. We\\'re super enthusiastic about it. If we\\'re successful long term, and we\\'re talking about an extra 1 billion gamers that we might be able to reach. And so I think that this is an exciting opportunity, just a long-term journey.\\\\nNow here in the West, we\\'ve had a lot more opportunity to refine the connections around the world and working through the data centers, the local hubs as well as people\\'s WiFi routers at home. And so we\\'ve been in beta for quite some time, as you know. And here in the West, our platform is open. And we have several hundred games now and we\\'re in the process of onboarding another 1,500 games. We\\'re the only cloud platform that\\'s based on Windows and allows us to be able to bring PC games to the cloud. And so the reach is -- we\\'ve had more experience here in the West with reach, and we\\'ve had -- we obviously have a lot more games that we can onboard. But I\\'m super enthusiastic about the partnership we have with Tencent.\\\\nOverall, our GeForce NOW -- you guys saw the launch, it\\'s -- the reception has been fantastic, the reviews have been fantastic. Our strategy has 3 components. There\\'s the GeForce NOW service that we provide ourselves. We also have GeForce NOW alliances with telcos around the world to reach the regions around the world that we don\\'t have a presence in. And that is going super well, and I\\'m excited about that. And then lastly, partnerships with large publishers, for example, like Tencent. And we offer them our platform, of course, and a great deal of software and just a lot of engineering that has to be done in collaboration to refine the service.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess a question on the gaming side. If I look at your overall revenue guide, it would seem to suggest that you\\'re looking for typically, I guess, better seasonal trends into April. And I guess can you speak to that? And then how are you seeing desktop gaming demand with ray tracing content becoming more available? How should we think about the growth trajectory through 2020? And then just really as a modeling question as part of gaming, with notebook now 1/3 of the revenues, how should we think about kind of the seasonality going into April and July for that part of your business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So C.J., I\\'m going to go first, and then Colette is going take it home here. So the first part of it is this, our gaming business has at the end -- I\\'m sorry. Okay. Our gaming business, the end market demand is really terrific. It\\'s really healthy. It\\'s been healthy throughout the whole year. And it\\'s pretty clear that RTX is doing fantastic. And it\\'s very -- it\\'s super clear now that ray tracing is the most important new feature of next-generation graphics. We have 30 -- over 30 games that have been announced, 11 games or so that have been shipped. The pipeline of ray tracing games that are going to be coming out is just really, really exciting. The second factor -- and one more thing about RTX, we finally have taken RTX down to $299. So it\\'s now at the sweet spot of gaming. And so RTX is doing fantastic. The sell-through is fantastic all over the world.\\\\nThe second part of our business that is changing in gaming is this -- the amount of notebook sales and the success of Nintendo Switch has really changed the profile of our overall gaming business. Our notebook business, as Colette mentioned earlier, has seen double-digit growth for 8 consecutive quarters, and this is unquestionably a new gaming category. Like it\\'s a new game console. This is going to be the largest game console in the world, I believe. And the reason for that is because there are more people with laptops than there are of any other device. And so the fact that we\\'ve been able to get RTX into a thin and light notebook, a thin and light notebook, is really a breakthrough. And it\\'s one of the reasons why we\\'re seeing such great success in notebook. Between the notebook business and our Nintendo Switch business, the profile of gaming overall has changed and has become more seasonal. It\\'s more seasonal because devices, systems, like notebooks and Switch, are built largely in 2 quarters, Q2 and Q3. And they build it largely in Q2 and Q3 because it takes a while to build them and ship them and put them into the hubs around the world. And they tend to build it ahead of the holiday season. And so that\\'s one of the reasons why Q3 will tend to be larger and Q4 will tend to be more seasonal and Q1 will tend to be more seasonal than the past. But the end demand is fantastic. RTX is doing great. And part of it is just a result of the success of our notebooks. I\\'m going to hand it over to Colette.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So with that from a background and you think about all those different components that are within gaming, the notebook, the overall Switch, and of course, all of the ray tracing that we have in terms of desktop, our normal seasonality, as we look at Q1 for gaming with all those 3 pieces, is usually sequentially down from Q4, sequentially down Q4 to Q1. This year, the outlook assumes it will probably be a little bit more pronounced due to the coronavirus. So in total, we\\'re probably looking at Q1 to be in the low double-digit sequential decline in gaming.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Semiconductor Capital Equipment & Specialty Semiconductor Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Good job on results and guide. On the same topic, coronavirus. Colette, I\\'m a bit surprised that the guidance -- the range on the guidance is not wider versus historic. Can you just talk about why not widen the range? And what went into that $100 million hit from the coronavirus?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So Atif, thanks for the question. Again, it\\'s still very early regarding the coronavirus. Our thoughts are out with both the employees, the families and others that are in China. So our discussions, both with our supply chain that is very prominent in the overall Asia region as well as our overall AIC makers as well as our customers, is as about as timely as we can be. And that went into our discussion and our thoughts on the overall guidance that we gave into our $100 million. We\\'ll just have to see how the quarter comes through, and we\\'ll discuss more when we get to it. But at this time, that was our best estimate at this time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWilliam Stein,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, I\\'d love to hear your thoughts as to how you anticipate the inference market playing out. Historically, NVIDIA\\'s had essentially all of the training market and little of the inference market in the last 1.5 years or so. I think that\\'s changed where you\\'ve done much better in inference. Now you have the T4 in the cloud, you have EGX at the edge. And you have Jetson, I think, is what it\\'s called at the sort of endpoint device. How do you anticipate that market for inference developing across those various positions? And how are you aligning your portfolio for that growth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks a lot, Will. Let\\'s see, I think the -- historically, inference has been a small part of our business because AI was still being developed. Deep learning, AI is not -- historical AI, classical machine learning weren\\'t particularly suited for GPUs and weren\\'t particularly suited for acceleration. It wasn\\'t until deep learning came along that the amount of computation necessary is just extraordinary. And the second factor is the type of AI models that were developed. Eventually, if -- the type of models related to natural language understanding and conversational AI and recommendation systems, these require instantaneous response. The faster the answer, the more likely someone is going to click on the answer. And so you know that latency matters a great deal, and it\\'s measurable. The effect on the business is directly measurable.\\\\nAnd so for conversational AI, for example, we\\'ve been able to reduce the latency of the entire pipeline from speech recognition to the language processing to, for example, fix the errors and such, come up with a recommendation to text to speech to the voice synthesis. That entire pipeline could take several seconds. We run it so fast that it\\'s possible now for us to process the entire pipeline within a couple of hundred, 200, 300 milliseconds. That is in the realm of interactive conversation.\\\\nBeyond that, it\\'s just simply too slow. And so the combination of AI models that are large and complex that are moving to inference, moving to production. And then secondarily, conversational AI and latency-sensitive models and applications where our GPUs are essential, now moving forward, I think you\\'re going to see a lot more opportunities for us in inference.\\\\nThe way to think about that long-term is acceleration is essential because of end of Dennard scaling. Process technology is going to demand that we compute in a different way. And the way that AI has evolved and deep learning, it suggests that acceleration on GPUs is just a really phenomenal approach.\\\\nData centers are going to have to be software-defined. And I think as I mentioned, I think I mentioned earlier to another question, I believe that in the future, the data center will all be accelerated. It will be all running AI models, and it will be software-defined and it will be programmable and having an accelerated computing platform is essential. As you move out to the edge, it really depends on whether your platform is software-defined, whether it has to be programmable or whether it\\'s fix functioned. There are many, many devices where the inference work is very specific. It could be something as simple as detecting changes in temperature or changes in sound or detecting motion. Those type of inference models are -- could still be based on deep learning. It\\'s function-specific. You don\\'t have to change it very often and you\\'re running 1 or 2 models at any given point in time. And so those devices are going to be incredibly cost-effective.\\\\nI believe, those AI chips, you\\'re going to have AI chips that are $0.50, $1, and you\\'re just going to put it into something and it\\'s going to be doing magical detections. The type of platforms that we\\'re in, such as self-driving cars and robotics, the software is so complicated and there\\'s so much evolution to come yet, and it\\'s going to constantly get better. Those software-defined platforms are really the ideal targets for us. And so we call it AI at the edge, edge computing devices. One of the edge computing devices I\\'m very excited about is what people call mobile edge or basically 5G telco edge. That data center will be programmable. We recently announced that we partnered with Ericsson and we\\'re going to be accelerating the 5G stack. And so that needs to be a software-defined data center. It runs all kinds of applications, including 5G. And those applications are going to be -- those opportunities are fantastic for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, I guess I had a question about your -- how you think about the sustainability of your market position in the data center? And I guess in my simplistic view, about 12 years ago, you made out a consensus call to invest in CUDA software, distribute it to universities. Neural networking took off and you were the de facto standard, and here we are right now. And for me, what\\'s interesting to hear is that the demand that you\\'re seeing today for your products is from markets that\\'s just developed within the last year. And my question is like, how do you think about your investment, your R&D investment strategy to make sure that you are staying way ahead of the market, of the competition and even your customers who are investing in these markets, too?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks, Mark. Our company has to live 10 years ahead of the market. And so we have to imagine where the world is going to be in 10 years\\' time, in 5 years\\' time and work our way backwards. Now our company is focused on one singular thing. The simplicity of it is incredible. And that one singular thing is accelerated computing, accelerated computing. And accelerated computing is all about the architecture, of course. It\\'s about the complicated systems that we\\'re in because throughput is high. When our acceleration, we can -- when we can compute 10x, 20x, 50x, 100x faster than the CPU, all of a sudden, everything becomes a bottleneck. Memory\\'s a bottleneck, networking\\'s a bottleneck, storage is a bottleneck, everything is a bottleneck. And so we have to be -- NVIDIA has to be a supremely good system designer. But the complexity of our stack, which is the software stack above it, is really where the investments over the course of the last -- some 29 years now, has really paid off.\\\\nNVIDIA, frankly, has been an accelerated computing company since the day it was born. And so we -- our company is constantly trying to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate. Of course, computer graphics was an original one, and we\\'re reinventing it with real-time ray tracing. We have rendering, which is a brand-new application that we\\'re making great progress in. We just talked -- I just mentioned 5G acceleration. Recently, we announced genomics computing. And so those are new applications that are really important to the future of computing.\\\\nIn the area of artificial intelligence, from image recognition to natural language understanding, to conversation, to recommendation systems, to robotics and animation, the number of applications that we\\'re going to accelerate in the field of AI is really, really broad. And each one of them are making tremendous progress and getting more and more complex. And so the question about the sustainability of our company really comes down to 2 dimensions. Let\\'s assume for the fact -- let\\'s assume for now that accelerated computing is the path forward, and we surely believe so. And there\\'s a lot of evidence from the laws of physics to the laws of computer science that would suggest that accelerated computing is the right path forward. But this really basically comes down to 2 dimensions. One dimension is are we continuing to expand? Are we continuing to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate? Whether it\\'s AI or computer graphics or genomics or 5G, for example.\\\\nAnd then the number -- and then the second is those applications, are they getting more impactful and adopted by the ecosystem, the industry? And are they continuing to be more complex? Those dimensions, the number of applications and the rich -- and the impact of those applications and the evolution, the growth of complexity of those applications, if those dynamics continue to grow, then I think we\\'re going to do a good job. We\\'re going to sustain. And so -- and I think when I spelled it out that way, it\\'s basically the equation of growth of our company. I think it\\'s fairly clear that the opportunities are fairly exciting ahead.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, I just wanted to ask you on the auto side. I think at least one of your customers might have slowed out their program. Just kind of curious as you look out the next couple of years, the challenges, if the OEM is moving slower? And then just any perspective on the regulatory side, has anything changed there, would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think that the automotive industry is struggling, but -- for all of the reasons that everybody knows. However, the enthusiasm to redefine and reinvent their business model has never been greater. Every single one of them, every single one of them would know now and they surely -- they\\'ve known for some time, and autonomous capabilities is really the vehicle to do that. They need to be tech companies. Every car company wants to be a tech company. They need to be a tech company. Every car company needs to be software-defined. And the platform by which to do so is an electric vehicle with autonomous autopilot capability. That car has to be software-defined. And this is their future and they\\'re racing to get there.\\\\nAnd so although the automotive industry is struggling in near term, their opportunity has never been better in my opinion. The future of AV is more important than ever. The opportunity is very real. The benefits of autonomous is for whether it\\'s safety, whether it\\'s utility, whether it\\'s cost reduction and productivity, has never been more clear. And so I think that I\\'m as enthusiastic as ever about the autonomous vehicles and the projects that we\\'re working on are moving ahead. And so the near-term challenges of the automotive industry or whatever sales slowdown in China that they\\'re experiencing, I feel badly about that. But the industry is as clearheaded about the importance of AV as ever.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We had an excellent quarter with strong demand for NVIDIA RTX graphics and NVIDIA AI platforms and record data center revenue. NVIDIA RTX is reinventing computer graphics, and the market\\'s response is excellent, driving a powerful upgrade cycle in both gaming and professional graphics, while opening whole new opportunities for us to serve the huge community of independent creative workers and social content creators and new markets in rendering and cloud gaming. Our data center business is enjoying a new wave of growth, powered by 3 key trends in AI, natural language understanding, conversational AI, deep recommenders, are changing the way people interact with the Internet. The public cloud demand for AI is growing rapidly. And as AI shifts from development to production, our inference business is gaining momentum. We\\'ll be talking a lot more about these key trends and much more at next month\\'s GTC Conference in San Jose. Come join me. You won\\'t be disappointed.

Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Q3 was a strong quarter for us, demonstrating the significant growth potential of AMD, driven by our high-performance products, leadership IP and long-term strategy.\\\\nRevenue increased 26% from a year ago to $1.64 billion. Gross margin also improved significantly year-over-year as we achieved profitability and generated positive free cash flow in the quarter.\\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we made excellent progress in Q3 as the continued success of our Ryzen family of CPUs, combined with significant graphics growth, resulted in a 74% increase in Computing and Graphics segment revenue year-over-year.\\\\nClient computing revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago as we expanded our Ryzen processor family and saw increased demand in the desktop market. Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 processors have ramped well in the desktop channel market, reaching 40% to 50% desktop market share at strategic e-tailers worldwide. In addition, OEM adoption is accelerating as customers ramp shipments in advance of the holiday sales cycle.\\\\nIn the quarter, we launched additional Ryzen CPUs, including Ryzen 3, expanding our reach in the mainstream and value market segments; Ryzen Threadripper processors, returning AMD to the high-end desktop market; and Ryzen PRO-based offerings, which have been adopted by all major commercial PC providers, including Dell, Lenovo and HP, expanding our presence in the commercial space.\\\\nAlso in the quarter, we qualified and began early shipments of our Ryzen Mobile processors, combining our Zen CPU cores and Vega GPU cores in a high-performance APU designed to power ultra-thin and 2-in-1 notebooks. Acer, HP and Lenovo plan to launch their initial Ryzen Mobile-based systems in the coming weeks, and we expect an expanded assortment of premium notebooks to launch in Q1 2018. \\\\nIn graphics, we achieved record GPU revenue in the quarter based on significantly improved ASPs and higher unit shipments from a year ago. These financial improvements were driven by the launch of our Vega-based GPUs and its strong demand for our Polaris products across both gaming and blockchain markets. In the quarter, we expanded further into premium portions of the graphics market with new consumer and professional GPU solutions. Our Radeon RX Vega family of GPUs launched in the channel, targeted at the enthusiast class gaming segment. Revenue from initial shipments of these products is significantly outpacing previous premium Radeon GPUs.\\\\nRadeon Instinct MI25, our GPU compute solution, also began shipping in volume to mega cloud data center customers, and Radeon Pro WX 9100 professional graphics cards, targeting the high-end professional content creation market, started shipping late in the quarter. In addition, we saw expanded AMD Radeon adoption with cloud customers in the quarter, driven by our investments in GPU compute. Amazon Web Services announced that they have deployed AMD Radeon Pro technology to power Amazon AppStream 2.0, driving GPU-accelerated cloud delivery of virtual applications. We also announced a collaboration with Baidu to build more flexible and powerful AI computing platforms based on the deployment of our Radeon Instinct GPUs in their data centers.\\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue was approximately flat year-over-year and increased 46% sequentially. Sequential growth was based on a seasonal increase in semi-custom revenue as well as growth in server revenue from our EPYC data center processors. Our semi-custom business continues to perform as expected for the year, and we anticipate seasonal demand to remain healthy as our customers enter the holiday sales cycle with Sony\\'s PlayStation 4 Pro and Microsoft\\'s Xbox One X.\\\\nIn our server business, the server revenue increased from a year ago as we began ramping sales of our EPYC data center processors to key cloud and OEM customers. Customer engagement with our EPYC processors is growing as the true performance and features of the new platform are tested and implemented, with Tencent and JD.com joining the list of data center customers planning to deploy EPYC processors.\\\\nIn a short period, 3 of the Super 7 mega data center providers have publicly announced plans to deploy EPYC-based products into their Hyperscale environments, including Baidu, Microsoft Azure and Tencent, and we have strong engagements with other major cloud providers. In addition, HP Enterprise and Dell are in the process of bringing their first EPYC-based platforms to market in Q4, and we are actively engaged with them to accelerate testing and validation of EPYC-based systems in data centers across a broad number of large and medium enterprise customers. We remain confident and focused on the steady expansion of our data center presence over the coming quarters based on the high performance and rich feature set of the EPYC product.\\\\nIn addition, as a part of our ongoing strategy to monetize our differentiated IP, we successfully closed a patent licensing transaction in the quarter.\\\\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Throughout 2017, we have delivered significant year-on-year revenue growth and margin expansion as we achieved multiple major product, customer and market milestones. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we look forward to continuing to accelerate our business. 2017 annual revenue growth is now tracking above our previous estimates, and we remain confident in our ability to make AMD one of the premier long-term growth companies in the tech industry.\\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I\\'m pleased with our performance for the third quarter of 2017. We increased revenue 26% year-over-year, expanded gross margin and achieved both operating and net income, with net income of $110 million and diluted earnings of $0.10 per share. We are executing well with our strongest portfolio of products in many years, including our Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon Vega offerings. Let me provide some specifics for the third quarter.\\\\nRevenue of $1.64 billion grew 26% year-over-year and 34% sequentially. This is our highest quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2011. Year-over-year growth was primarily due to our Computing and Graphics segment, while sequential growth was driven by the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue seasonality as well as higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue. We also took another step in our IP monetization efforts by closing a patent licensing agreement that had a positive impact on both our segments.\\\\nGross margin was 35%, up 4 percentage points year-over-year, primarily driven by the benefit of IP-related revenue and a richer mix from the Computing and Graphics segment, which were partially offset by cost associated with our GLOBALFOUNDRIES Wafer Supply Agreement for wafers purchased at another foundry. We continue to make good progress on the ramp of our new high-performance products, which had a positive impact on our gross margins.\\\\nOperating expenses were $419 million compared to $353 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher R&D-related investments and expenses related to annual employee incentive programs driven by our better financial performance. Operating income was $155 million in the third quarter of 2017, a solid improvement from $70 million a year ago. Third quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $45 million, up slightly from $43 million a year ago. Lower interest expense from a year ago was largely offset by withholding taxes for licensing revenue.\\\\nNet income was $110 million or diluted earnings of $0.10 per share as compared to $27 million or $0.03 per share a year ago. The diluted earnings per share calculations for the third quarter of 2017 was based on 1.143 billion shares, which includes 100.6 million shares related to our 2026 convertible notes. Adjusted EBITDA was $191 million, compared to $103 million a year ago.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $819 million, up 74% year-over-year, primarily due to strong sales of our Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $70 million compared to a loss of $66 million a year ago. The solid improvement was primarily due to higher revenue.\\\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $824 million, approximately flat year-over-year due to lower semi-custom SoC sales partially offset by IP-related revenue. Additionally, server revenue increased from a year ago driven by the increased sales of EPYC products. As you heard earlier from Lisa, customer interest and deployment plans are strong. Operating income was $84 million, down $52 million from $136 million a year ago, primarily due to higher costs.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $879 million at the end of the quarter, up from $844 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $794 million, down 5% from $833 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nLong-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.36 billion. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.74 billion. In the third quarter, we used $28 million from our lower interest secured revolving line of credit to pay down long-term debt, which has a higher interest rate. Free cash flow was $32 million compared to $20 million in the year-ago period.\\\\nBefore turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter, let me remind you for comparative purposes that the fourth quarter of 2016 was a 14-week quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect revenue to decrease approximately 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. At the midpoint, this equates to revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 35%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $410 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million; and inventory to be down sequentially. We now expect 2017 annual revenue to increase by greater than 20% over 2016 compared to the prior guidance of mid- to high-teens percentage growth. We do not anticipate significant changes to the diluted share count in the fourth quarter, and you can find additional information regarding the share count in the CFO commentary, which is posted online.\\\\nIn closing, the third quarter was a strong quarter, and we are pleased with the momentum of our new premium products. We are making solid progress towards our growth and margin expansion objectives, and as our financial performance improves, we remain committed to investing in our multi-generational road maps and achieving our long-term financial targets.\\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the Q&A session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready for our first question, please.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          For the first one, I was wondering if you could help quantify the benefit of your IP license in the 2 different segments. And is this a one-off? Or do you see ongoing benefits in Q4 and beyond?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Vivek. Hey, thanks for the question. We did close a IP-related transaction. It was a patent licensing transaction. The revenue and benefit was spread over both segments. When we look at it going forward, we have a pipeline of IP deals, and we\\'re constantly looking at them. And from our standpoint, we\\'re working several deals in progress. So we believe that IP-related revenue will be a factor as we go forward, but our primary focus is on the product-related revenue and the product-related growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So Vivek, just to remind you, I mean, in line, you\\'ve heard us talk about our IP monetization efforts, and this is very much in line with that. And as Lisa said, the benefit is spread over both segments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And then for my follow-up, Lisa, when I look at your Q4 outlook, it\\'s sort of in line with seasonality, perhaps somewhat better. Can you give us some more color around the adoption of your -- the new Ryzen Mobile portfolio, but more importantly, your EPYC products? When will we start to see a more tangible contribution from your EPYC product sales?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Vivek. So look, we are very pleased with how the revenue ramp is going in general on our new products. When you look at the Q4 guidance, year-over-year, we\\'ll be up 26%, so we\\'re really accelerating the business as we go into the second half of the year. As you know, our business is typically seasonal. And so Q3 is the peak, and then we\\'re down seasonally from Q3 to Q4 due to some of the semi-custom revenue. But what we see going into the fourth quarter is we see a strong ramp of new products. We see Ryzen continuing to ramp. We will ship volume of Ryzen Mobile in Q4 and then more in the first half of the year. We will see a ramp of EPYC, and we will also see an OEM ramp of Vega. In terms of the headwinds, we have the semi-custom seasonality, and we\\'re also predicting that there will be some leveling off of some of the cryptocurrency demand. As we look at it, it continues to be a factor, but we\\'ve seen restocking in the channels and stuff like that. So we\\'re being a little bit conservative on the cryptocurrency side of the equation.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Can you give us some idea of whether you have any semi-custom wins that might bring in new revenue streams in 2018? And specifically, are you in any discussions with potential customers for semi-custom designs in autonomous driving or data center processor and accelerator applications?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, David. So look, the semi-custom business continues to be a business that\\'s performing well for us. So we are -- as we go into 2018, we are expanding the customer set beyond our traditional Sony and Microsoft game consoles. Actually, this past quarter, we announced that Atari will be adopting a customized processor for their next generation. We also have a number of new opportunities that we continue to work, and they are in markets outside of game console, including some of the markets that you mentioned. So overall, we do expect there will be some puts and takes in the semi-custom business as we go into 2018 and there will be some product revenue that will ramp, particularly in the second half of 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First one on the gross margin outlook for Q4, it looks like it\\'s flattish versus Q3, and I guess I might have expected the -- a sequential increase given that you will likely have a better mix. So I\\'m hoping you can reconcile that. I\\'m wondering if licensing had an impact on that or it\\'s just fixed cost absorption.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Let me start, Mark, and then maybe Devinder will add. So look, we have multiple puts and takes in the business as we look at gross margin. When we look at gross margin in Q3, we were pleased with the gross margin progress, and that came from both the richer mix of our Computing and Graphics revenue year-over-year as well as some benefit from the IP-related transaction. As we go into Q4, we have new products continuing to ramp, so you\\'ll see Ryzen, Vega and EPYC ramp. And the primary driver for the Q4 gross margin is the product revenue, and we do have sort of the headwind of not having the benefit of the IP revenue in Q3. So those are the puts and takes. But the main point is the new product revenue is ramping and the gross margins are accretive, and that\\'s contributing to our Q4 gross margin outlook.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Mark, if you can -- if I can just add, if you look at the margin trend compared to 2016, 2016, we had 31% gross margin and we expect to be at 34% this year, and that\\'s primarily based on the strength of the new products that Lisa referenced. And from a long-term model standpoint, we are on track with what we laid out in the Financial Analyst Day of going from 31% to 34% and then expecting to be greater than 36% in 2018 on the strength of the new premium products that are ramping into 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And a follow-up, if I may, on the EPYC server side. Can you help us understand to what extent you\\'re shipping to customers who are going through testing right now versus shipping into customers who are actually deploying EPYC in live data center applications?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Mark. So look, we\\'re pleased with how things are going with the EPYC ramp overall. So we have been shipping to both cloud as well as non-cloud customers in Q3, mostly early platform type testing. In Q4, we will -- we expect to see some level of deployment, again, both in cloud and non-cloud applications. With the new platforms coming in from HP Enterprise and Dell, what we\\'re seeing is actually a ramp of new seeding opportunities, particularly in medium and large enterprise customers. So overall, the EPYC ramp is going well, and we expect more deployments as we go into Q4 and into next year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKulin Patel,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Associate    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Kulin Patel calling in for Ambrish. You highlighted in your PR that you had a GM headwind related to buying wafers at another foundry. Do you expect any meaningful external purchases in Q4 or going forward into 2018 that could be a headwind to gross margins?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the way I look at that is, if you look at Q3 from a volume standpoint and the volume is pretty high, and that\\'s why it\\'s highlighted from a viewpoint of the cost, the way you want to look at it going forward, Q4 and beyond, is all of the costs are related with the WSA that\\'s referenced in the script. So it\\'s contemplated within our guidance and our long-term models.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKulin Patel,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Associate    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And I had a question on -- you launched the Radeon Instinct MI25 [maybe] last quarter. Can you discuss the traction you\\'re seeing in that product? Are you seeing any meaningful revenues in 3Q and in your 4Q outlook?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So the Radeon Instinct MI25 is Vega for the cloud data centers. We did actually start shipping volume in Q3 to multiple customers. We do see very high interest in the product portfolio, and so we expect that to continue to ramp into Q4. And there\\'s a lot of focus on increasing the software usability and software flexibility, and so we continue to invest in those areas. But overall, I\\'m actually very pleased with the interest in MI25, and it\\'s coming from multiple customers in a number of markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I was interested in your comments that the sequential growth in the Computing and Graphics business was driven primarily by graphics. How literally should we take that? And I guess, if graphics is up close to $150 million sequentially, is that business now on par with the CPU business? Can you just give us a general sense of the size of the 2 businesses there?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So overall, the growth in Computing and Graphics, when you look over the past few quarters, has been very strong. And we\\'ve seen growth both on the Ryzen side, particularly in the desktop side of the business, as well as on the graphics side. So in terms of size of the business, again, I think we stated in the prepared remarks that the GPU business had a record quarter for us, and we\\'re seeing very strong growth. We\\'re seeing strong growth as a result of the new product launches. So the Vega product actually did very well for us in the quarter as well as overall Polaris in both gaming and blockchain markets. But yes, we\\'re pleased with the graphics performance. But I\\'ll also say, Ryzen did very well in the quarter. We look at the progress that we\\'re making in the desktop channel when you look across retailers and e-tailers across the world and in the sort of Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 segment, we\\'re seeing significant share gain in those parts of the business. So I think both parts of the Computing and Graphics business are doing well, and we continue to expect growth as we go forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And is it possible to size the blockchain portion of that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the blockchain tends to be -- again, it\\'s hard to separate because it goes through some of the same channels as gaming does. I will say that blockchain sort of behaved as we expected in Q3, so we didn\\'t see anything that we didn\\'t expect. We did see some benefit of channel restocking, so if you look at the -- our channel inventories today compared to July, we have healthier channel inventory levels. And we expect that consumer blockchain will level off a bit as we go into Q4, but there\\'s also a commercial blockchain component that we believe is interesting and likely to continue into the medium term. As we look into Q4 though, we also see growth from just the OEM side of the GPU business as we start ramping Vega into OEMs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, apologize, I\\'m kind of juggling a couple calls like everyone else. I apologize if this is a repeat. But I\\'m just wondering, just given the qualitative success of Ryzen and the accretive ASPs and gross margins, I\\'m wondering if you could just help us understand, on a more quantitative basis, how much of your PC unit business is now Ryzen. And I guess, more importantly, how do we think about that progressing over the next several quarters? And kind of where\\'s the tipping point where you think we\\'ll start to see some significant leverage relative to the accretive ASPs and the accretive gross margins?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, John. So look, we are really pleased with how Ryzen is performing competitively and -- in the market. It\\'s fair to say, though, that we\\'re still at the early stages of the Ryzen ramp, so primarily in Q2 and Q3, Ryzen has been a desktop channel phenomenon. So most of the sales have been in the desktop channel. We have started ramping OEMs in the desktop space, and we will continue ramping OEMs as we go into Q4. But it\\'s nowhere near the majority of the client revenue. You should expect that Ryzen will continue to ramp for us through the first half of next year because we\\'re adding more and more platforms as we speak, both on the consumer and also on the commercial front. And -- so we see -- again, it\\'s ramping well. The ASPs are good, so actually, we saw some ASP increase in Ryzen as we went from Q2 to Q3, and we launched the high-end desktop version as well as Ryzen 3. And we\\'ll continue to ramp into Q4 and first half of next year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then, Lisa, just as my follow-on, kind of a similar question around EPYC, and just I know you guys have kind of talked about potentially exiting the end of next year at about a 2% share. I\\'m just kind of curious how you think about the ramp of EPYC. And if you can differentiate between sort of your Hyperscale customers who might take it a little bit sooner versus more the -- the more traditional OEM channel, how should we be thinking about that on EPYC?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So John, I\\'m not sure we ever said 2% by the end of next year, but what I would say is that we expect EPYC to be a sizable portion of our revenue in 2018. So the second half of this year, we\\'re doing early pilots and we\\'re doing some early deployments. The Hyperscale guys are aggressive, and they are first. We will start seeing some enterprise revenue here in Q4 as the early platforms launch, but I expect more of the enterprise to fill in as we go into 2018. And I think the important point is, as we look at the product, as we look at the competition and where we\\'re positioned, the product positioning is strong, and so the customer engagements are growing. And we\\'re seeing significant interest from enterprise customers ramp now as some of the OEM platforms are becoming available and starting their seeding. So overall, EPYC will continue to ramp into 2018 and should be a sizable -- we expect it to be a sizable portion of our revenue in 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I want to go back to the mix of the business and specifically in the Computing and Graphics segment. The client ASPs were down sequentially, and you highlighted that being because of mobile. Somewhat similar to John\\'s question, Lisa, when do you expect to see the ASPs in that segment of your business start to turn to be a positive driver as opposed to a bit of a headwind?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So definitely, desktop ASPs are up. Mobile ASPs are down. I think we will see -- again, there will be an initial ramp of Ryzen Mobile in Q4, but I think in the first half of the year, you should see a significant amount of the volume that we ship into notebook be with Ryzen Mobile. So when I look at sort of the rate and pace of the ramp, I think it\\'s going as we expect with desktop channel first, then desktop OEMs and then commercial desktop and then, same, consumer notebook starting in Q4, ramping into Q1, and then we\\'ll see commercial platforms in the first half of \\'18 as well. So I think there should be a steady ramp of ASPs as we go forward. We\\'re also taking some opportunity, as you can imagine, to clean up some excess inventory as we transition to the new product, and so that\\'s part of what we\\'re doing to just ensure that we have a strong launch as we go into the new product portfolio. But overall, behaving as we expected and in some sense, we\\'re very pleased with how we\\'re positioned competitively with the product.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And I guess, as my follow-up, switching to one for Devinder on the OpEx side of things. OpEx was a little bit higher in the third quarter. It\\'s dropping sequentially into the fourth quarter. You\\'ve talked in the past about a 31% OpEx to revenue guide range for this year. You\\'re probably not going to guide for \\'18 by that much -- with that much precision tonight. But is there any sort of puts and takes we can think of as far as how you guys are considering your investment philosophy as we move into 2018?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No. I think the first thing I\\'ll say is we do want to invest in the business, especially with the growth of opportunities we have and primarily targeting the OpEx investments towards R&D. They are -- in the current moment, there\\'s a lot of products ramping just in the last few months. You heard about the Ryzen ramp. You heard about EPYC. We talk about Vega, and obviously, their go-to-market costs will ramp up new products. But as far as our 2017 guidance is concerned, I have said previously 31% has potential of revenue, but I think right now where the numbers are coming out, especially with the strength of the revenue side of the equation, we think we end up at about 30% on an expense-to-revenue ratio in 2017, of which you -- as you probably recall, is at the upper end of what we are setting of a long-term target model, which is 26% to 30%. So actually, I\\'m pretty pleased because, if all else, if everything works out in the Q4 guidance that we gave and in 2016 would have been a 32% of revenue, in 2017, approximately 30%, and then obviously, we\\'ll see where we get into 2018 but very pleased from a viewpoint of being able to make the investments in the business to support the product road map, the go-to-market cost for the ramp of new products and at the same time, bring down the percentage of OpEx over revenue.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I wanted to ask a little bit about the forward road map, particularly in the processor group. I know that you guys have talked quite a bit about taking the road map down to 7-nanometer next year, and I think Mark gave some public comments about doing some stuff on 12-nanometer with GF. So I think it\\'d be helpful if you could talk to the extent that you can about some of the feature road map and things that might be follow-on to the products that are ramping currently.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, Matt. So 7-nanometer, we\\'ve talked about, is a very important node for us, and it\\'s an important node for the industry. It\\'s a major node, so we have a lot of engineering resources on that. And you should expect that, that will be across all of our businesses, and we\\'re actively working on those products now. We do see an opportunity with 12-nanometer. 12-nanometer is a relatively small engineering lift, and I would view it as a performance enhancement to our current road map. And so we are working, taking some of our products -- I would say, a subset of our products into 12-nanometer in 2018 to augment the performance of our client and graphics road map. But I think the significant resources are on 7, and that\\'s progressing well. We\\'re overall pleased with how the performance on that is looking, and then we will opportunistically look at some products to go into 12-nanometer as it makes sense for the road map.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And Devinder, I wanted to press a little bit harder on the gross margin impacts of a few things that you called out, particularly -- I mean, is there any way that you can quantify for us at all the impact of the IP revenue on gross margins either in the third quarter or comparatively into Q4? And second, I think a lot of us are aware of the forward charges you\\'ll get for using wafers from other foundries, but I assume that, that applies also to the gaming console business that comes out of TSMC currently. If you could clarify those 2 things, that\\'d be great.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think if you look at it from an overall standpoint, if you look at the cost impact, it\\'s all within our guidance. I think if you look at IP from that standpoint, we have several IP deals in the pipeline. For Q3 specifically, we thought it was likely that we would be able to close an IP-related deal in the quarter, and that\\'s how it turned out. And you see the benefit across both the segments. And from a go-forward standpoint, despite the costs being there, we look at it overall from a viewpoint of the trend of the margin. Major provider of the gross margin uplift is the premium new products that we are launching. And then, obviously, there\\'s opportunities from an IP standpoint to benefit the P&L, we go ahead and put that in the equation.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I just want to better understand the December guidance a bit, maybe if you can talk about it between the 2 segments. The Embedded business last year was down 40%. It\\'s been tracking down slightly year-over-year. So is that the right way to think about that segment this December? And then maybe you can talk about on the graphics side. I just want to understand the commentary. You said that crypto or blockchain was kind of flattening out and that you were kind of getting some restocking. Just to kind of understand, when you look at growth in that segment, what are the moving pieces?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Blayne, let me answer that question. So overall, I think our business does have the seasonal pattern where the Q3 is a peak, and we\\'re down in Q4 primarily due to the semi-custom business. I believe those dynamics are the same. I\\'ve -- we\\'ve looked at sort of how the business will perform on a year-over-year basis. We believe that semi-custom revenue will be down a little bit on a year-over-year basis, and that\\'s expected. We\\'re in the fifth year of the cycle, and you would expect that units to be down, although we have some positive mix because of the new launch of the Microsoft Xbox One X console, which is a higher ASP product for us. When you look at the graphics business, again, overall, we see the business as quite strong. We see Vega ramping as we go into Q4. We see that from an OEM ramp standpoint. We see that from a GPU compute standpoint, and that\\'s offset with a little bit of leveling off of the blockchain demand. But overall, I think we see sort of Computing and Graphics continuing to grow as we go into Q4.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then just maybe a second question following up on some of the questions on process node. You had high reuse with the server product this time. When you see -- how do you think about the R&D cost in terms of if you were doing a core at TSMC versus doing one at GLOFO, a dual track? As you look into \\'18, how should you think about the OpEx required to do that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So it\\'s part of our engineering model. So we\\'ve -- we sort of engineered a model where we can use our IP at multiple foundries, and that will continue as we go into 7-nanometer. So if you look at this year, we have multiple products in 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer. As we go into 2018 and beyond, it\\'s the same thing. So there are no additional costs related to our dual-sourcing strategy. I think from an overall R&D standpoint, as Devinder said, we will look to ramp our spending in line with revenue, and primarily, it\\'s around continuing to invest in our new market opportunities, continuing to invest on the GPU side and what we\\'re doing in the compute markets, continuing to strengthen our sales and marketing as we go to market with these broad new products. But it\\'s -- there\\'s no particular OpEx impact of using multiple foundries.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Security.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, can you give us, in terms of timing, 7-nanometer for next year? And what products would be the focus initially for that node?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Hans. So I\\'m not going to comment directly on timing of products because, obviously, there\\'s a lot of R&D yet to be done. But I would say that our product portfolio, in general, will take advantage of 7-nanometer. You should expect our server portfolio,  our graphics portfolio and our client portfolio to all take advantage of 7-nanometer at some point in time. And we like the performance as well as the power and the density strength that we get from it. And so again, we think it\\'ll really help to improve our competitive positioning as we look forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right. And then as a follow-up, if you can answer this, and maybe it was already answered, so forgive me. The -- on the IP front in Q3, did you indicate what end market or what type of application or what geographic location the IP relationship is all about?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we did say that the IP transaction was a patent licensing-related transaction, so that\\'s different from the technology licensing, for example, that we did with THATIC. This was a straight patent licensing. And the great thing about our patent portfolio is, beyond sort of our core markets, it\\'s -- it has applicability across a broad range of markets, and so this was a patent transaction and not a technology licensing transaction.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So I was just wondering on the data center side, when you look at -- you mentioned EPYC was strong. I was wondering if your breakout [comments] (inaudible) EPYC and what -- how it grew sequentially. And (inaudible) [have you seen it going] into the December quarter at all?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, yes. You broke up a little bit there, Vijay. But I think I got the question. So the question was sort of the strength of EPYC and where do we see it -- how do -- where do we see it going in Q4. Look, I think EPYC had a good quarter. Obviously, it\\'s growing off of a small base since we had a small base for the server revenue, but we certainly saw growth in unit shipments and revenue into Q3. We will see more growth or we expect to see more growth into Q4, especially as some of these trial runs turn into more deployment activity. And as more OEMs ramp our platforms, the platforms will be more available in the industry, and we\\'re seeing growing interest from a number of enterprise customers as well. So -- but we should think about EPYC as a long-term growth driver. So yes, we will see growth into Q4, but it will be a sizable portion of our revenue as we go into 2018.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. (inaudible) and then you start breaking out that enterprise [data center] out of the semi-custom like your peers are doing as you grow that market? Lastly, just wondering how channel inventory in graphics side GPUs are.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the question was whether we would begin breaking out enterprise separately as a segment, and I don\\'t know that we\\'ve made any decision to do that. And then second question was very hard to hear, Vijay. We\\'ll ask you to repeat it, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Just channel inventory in GPUs. How do you see channel inventory on the GPU side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Okay, so for your first question, I think, as Laura said, we haven\\'t made any determinations about a different segment reporting. But we will give you markers on how the business is growing, and I think it will be clear just given the accretive nature of EPYC. As we start ramping that product, you\\'ll see more impact of the product-related revenue. The second question is as it relates to channel inventory in graphics. I believe that channel inventory is healthier in graphics here in October than it was in July. We\\'ve certainly restocked some of the channel both for Polaris as well as the Vega products. I would still say that channel inventory might be a little bit light. It\\'s not fully restocked yet, but it\\'s certainly healthier than it was in the July time frame.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Chris Danely from Citigroup.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWayne Loeb,   -     [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Wayne Loeb for Chris Danely. Can I ask you how you feel you did share wise in CPU and GPU in Q3?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we will have to wait until, obviously, the share results come in. I think when we look at the CPU side of the business, we feel really good about how Ryzen is doing in the desktop channel, so we think we definitely made progress there. As you look, overall, we have to see how the overall results come in. And on the GPU side, again, we shipped a significant volume. It was a record quarter for us, and we saw strength across our new products as well as our current products, and we saw significant ASP growth, which is important for us. But again, I would wait until the overall results come out in a few weeks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWayne Loeb,   -     [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Could you also give your view on the overall PC industry? Was it better, worse, the same as expected?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think that\\'s a good question. I think the overall PC industry is about what we expected, maybe a tad bit better, but I would say about what we expected. We see good geographical -- sort of the geographies are doing well, particularly North America and Europe. There\\'s a little bit of softness in China, particularly at the low end of the market, and I think there\\'s some change in dynamics in China. But overall, I think the PC market was about what is expected, and that\\'s a good thing.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question today is coming from Tristan Gerra from Baird.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTristan Gerra,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You\\'ve announced some design wins for EPYC. Have you seen the number of design wins increase in the quarter? And is what you have enough to reach that longer-term target of 10% market share? Or do you need to line up more design wins to get there?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. That\\'s a very good question. So we have seen design wins and customer engagements increase in the quarter. We\\'ve seen customers who started with one platform now looking at multiple platforms with EPYC. And then in terms of design win coverage, we believe we have design win and platform coverage to meet or exceed our share goal targets. So it\\'s not a design win statement. It\\'s really a conversion of design wins to revenue as we help our customers ramp in the coming quarters. So very happy with the customer progress, very happy with the number of platforms that we have, and we continue to expand those platforms and the customer base over time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTristan Gerra,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then my quick follow-up will be, how do you see the opportunities of fitting EPYC and Vega in notably in enterprise platforms? Is that a fitting factor? Do customers value this as a system solution versus just one architecture?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, we have seen good interest from both OEMs as well as end customers on looking at EPYC and our MI25 product together. We actually have a working machine, the P47 petaflop machine that we announced at SIGGRAPH, and we have actually a number of customers using that to trial their software and their application. And so yes, I do think it\\'s a selling point. I do believe that customers do want some integrated system solutions. But as we always say, the products operate very well standalone, and they work with other products as well. But we will continue to work on those system-level solutions for customers.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We\\'ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\\'d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - CFO and EVP    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Shawn. We had a strong start to the year, highlighting our record first quarter with a near tripling of Datacenter revenue, reflecting surging interest in artificial intelligence. Overall, quarterly revenue reached $1.94 billion, up 48% from a year earlier, down 11% sequentially and above our outlook of $1.9 billion. Growth remained broad-based with year-on-year gains in each of our 4 platforms: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive.\\\\nFrom a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 45% to $1.56 billion from the year earlier and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $332 million. And we recognized the remaining $43 million in revenue from our Intel agreement.\\\\nLet\\'s start with our Gaming platform. Gaming revenue in the first quarter was $1.03 billion, up 49% year-on-year. Gamers continue to show great interest in the Pascal-based GPUs, including gaming notebooks. Our Tegra gaming platforms also did extremely well. Demand remained healthy for our enthusiast class, GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, introduced nearly a year ago. It was complemented this past quarter with GTX 1080 Ti, which runs 35% faster and was launched at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. GTX 1080 Ti is designed to handle the demand of 4K gaming and high-end VR experiences. Typical of many supportive reviews, Ars Technica, stated, \\\\\"It is undoubtedly a fantastic piece of engineering, cool, quiet and without rival. Those that demand the absolute very best in cutting-edge graphics need look no further.\\\\\"\\\\nWe also released the next generation of our Titan class product, the TITAN Xp, designed for enthusiasts and researchers who demand extreme performance. Gaming continues to be driven by the headlong growth in eSports. The newest title, Overwatch, added 30 million gamers in its first year. GeForce was the graphics platform of choice at all of the top eSports tournaments, including the finals of the big 4 international competitions.\\\\nWith apologies to the start of the baseball season, eSports is now as popular among U.S. male millennials as America\\'s favorite pastime. More people watch gaming than HBO, Netflix, ESPN and Hulu combined. GeForce sales remained underpinned by the steady stream of AAA titles coming onto market, which continue to push for more GPU performance. \\\\nIn the months ahead, we\\'ll see a series of highly anticipated blockbuster titles. Among them are Destiny 2, coming to the PC for the first time, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, Shadow of War and the next installment of the Call of Duty franchise, World War II. We are excited to be working with Nintendo on its acclaimed Switch gaming system. Great reviews and reports of the system selling out in many geographies are a strong part of this platform.\\\\nMoving to Professional Visualization. Quadro revenue grew to $205 million, up 8% from a year ago, amid continued demand for high-end real-time rendering and more powerful mobile workstation. We\\'re seeing significant increase in professional VR solutions driven by Quadro P6000 GPUs. Lockheed Martin is deploying Quadro to create realistic VR walk-throughs of the U.S. Navy\\'s most advanced ships. The Marines utilize VR to train aircrew personnel. And IKEA is rolling out VR to many of its stores, helping consumers configure their kitchens from a huge array of options, which they can visualize in sharp detail.\\\\nNext, Datacenter. Record revenue of $409 million was nearly triple that of a year ago. The 38% rise from Q4 marked its seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Driving growth was demand from cloud service providers and enterprises building training clusters for web services plus strong gains in high-performance computing, GRID graphics visualization and our DGX-1 AI supercomputer. AI has quickly emerged as the single most powerful force in technology. And at the center of AI are NVIDIA GPUs.\\\\nAll of the world\\'s major Internet and cloud service providers now use NVIDIA Tesla-based GPU accelerators: AWS, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft as well as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. We also announced that Microsoft is bringing NVIDIA Tesla P100 and P40 GPUs to its Azure cloud. Organizations are increasingly building out AI-enabled applications using training clusters, evident in part by growing demand for DGX-1. We are seeing a number of significant deals. Among them are Fujitsu\\'s installment of 24 systems integrated into an AI supercomputer for RIKEN, Japan\\'s largest research center, as well as new supercomputers at Oxford University, GE and Audi.\\\\nWorking with Facebook, we announced the launch of the Caffe2 deep learning framework as well as Big Basin servers with Tesla P100 GPUs. To help meet huge demand for expertise in the field of AI, we announced earlier today plans to train 100 people this year through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, representing a 10x increase from last year. Through on-site training, public events and online courses, DLI provides practical training on the tools of AI to developers, data scientists and researchers.\\\\nOur HPC business doubled year-on-year, driven by the adoption of Pascal GPUs into supercomputing centers worldwide. The use of AI and accelerated computing in HPC is driving additional demand in governance intelligence, higher education research and finance.\\\\nOur GRID graphic virtualization business more than tripled, driven by growth in business services, education and automotive. Intuit\\'s latest TurboTax release deploys GRID to connect tax filers seeking real-time advice with CPAs. And Honda is using GRID to bring together engineering and design teams based in different countries.\\\\nFinally, Automotive. Revenue grew to a record $140 million, up 24% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, primarily from infotainment modules. We are continuing to expand our partnerships with companies using AI to address the complex problem of autonomous driving. Since our DRIVE PX 2 AI car platform began shipping just 1 year ago, more than 225 car and truck makers, suppliers, research organizations and start-ups have begun developing with it. That number has grown by more than 50% in the past quarter alone, the result of the platform\\'s enhanced processing power and the introduction of TensorRT for the in-vehicle AI inferencing.\\\\nThis quarter, we announced 2 important partnerships: Bosch, world\\'s largest auto supplier, which does business all over the world, carmakers is working to create a new AI self-driving car computer based on our Xavier platform; and Paccar, one of the world\\'s largest truck makers, is developing self-driving solutions for Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF. \\\\nWe continue to view AI as the only solution for autonomous driving. The nearly infinite range of road conditions, traffic patterns and unexpected events are impossible to anticipate with hand-coded software or computer vision alone. We expect our DRIVE PX 2 AI platform to be capable of delivering Level 3 autonomy for cars, trucks and shuttles by the end of the year, with Level 4 autonomy moving into production by the end of 2018.\\\\nNow turning to the rest of Q1 income statement. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter were 59.4% and 59.6%, respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $596 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $517 million, up 17% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiatives. GAAP operating income was $554 million and non-GAAP operating income was $637 million, nearly doubling from a year ago. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $507 million, non-GAAP net income was $533 million, more than doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strengths as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion.\\\\nFor fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In Q1, we issued $82 million in quarterly cash dividends.\\\\nNow turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $1.95 billion plus or minus 2%. Excluding the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement, total revenue is expected to grow 3% sequentially. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.4%, 58.6%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. These reflect approximately a 100 basis points impact from the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $605 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $8 million, inclusive of additional charges from early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $3 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items.\\\\nFurther financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website.\\\\nFinally, this week, we are sponsoring our annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley. Reflecting the surging importance of accelerating computing, GTC has grown to more than 7,000 attendees from 60 countries, up from 1,000 when we started 8 years ago. Among its highlights, Jen-Hsun will deliver a news-filled keynote tomorrow morning. We have 550-plus talks, more than half on AI. Developers will have access to 70 labs and workshops to learn about deep learning and GPU computing. And we will award a total of $1.5 million to the 6 most promising companies, among the 1,300 in our Inception Program for AI start-ups. We will be hosting our Annual Investor Day tomorrow and hope to see many of you there.\\\\nWe will now open up the call for questions. (Operator Instructions) Operator, will you please poll for questions?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the HPC and Datacenter business, clearly impressive growth. And I\\'m hoping that you can maybe drill down on the drivers here. I guess on the cloud side, we think of 2 different areas, GPU as a service versus the cloud company\\'s own AI effort. And I\\'m hoping you could help us understand to the extent where the demand is falling into either one of those buckets. And then on the enterprise side, I think there\\'s a view out there that the enterprise is just -- is going to the cloud. So to hear you talk about training clusters for web services is very interesting. And I was hoping you could provide some more color on that demand driver.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Mark, thanks for your question. So our GPU computing business for Datacenter is growing very fast and it\\'s growing on multiple dimensions. On the one hand, there\\'s high-performance computing using traditional numerical methods. We call that HPC. That\\'s growing. There is, in enterprise, the virtualization of graphics. There\\'s a whole lot of desktop PCs running around. However, more and more people would like to have thinner laptops or they would like to have a different type of computer and still be able to run Windows. And they would like to virtualize basically their entire PC and put it in the data center. It\\'s easier to manage. The total cost of ownership is lower, and mobile employees could enjoy their work wherever they happen to be. And so the second pillar of that is called GRID and it\\'s basically virtualizing the PC. And as you can tell, virtualization, mobility, better security, those are all driving forces there. And then there\\'s the Internet companies. And the Internet companies, as you mentioned, really has 2 pillars. There\\'s the Internet service provision part where they\\'re using deep learning for their own applications, whether it\\'s photo tagging or product recommendation or recommending a restaurant or something you should buy or personalizing your webpage, helping you with search, provisioning up the right apps, the right advertisement, language translation, speech recognition, so on and so forth. I mean, there\\'s a whole bunch of amazing applications that are made possible by deep learning. And so Internet service providers are using it for internal application development. And then lastly, what you mentioned is cloud service providers. And basically, because of the adoption of GPUs and because of the success of CUDA and so many applications are now able to be accelerated on GPUs, so that we can extend the capabilities in Moore\\'s Law so that we can continue to have the benefits of computing acceleration, which in the cloud means reducing cost. And that\\'s on the serve -- cloud service provider side of the Internet companies. So that would be Amazon Web Services, the Google Compute cloud, Microsoft Azure, the IBM Cloud, Alibaba\\'s Aliyun...\\\\n(technical difficulty)\\\\nby Microsoft Azure. We\\'re starting to see almost every single cloud service around the world standardizing on the NVIDIA architecture. So we\\'re seeing a lot of growth there as well. And so I think the nut of it all is that we\\'re seeing data center growth in GPU computing across the board.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And a follow-up, if I may. On the Gaming side, what we have observed over time is that when you launch a new platform, it definitely creates demand and you see 12 months of very good visibility and into growth. And I wonder -- I was wondering, as you see the Datacenter numbers come in quarter after quarter here, to what extent do you think the Datacenter demand that you\\'re seeing is -- I know it\\'s probably only -- you\\'re only able to answer qualitatively. But to what extent do you think the Datacenter is secondary versus you have a new platform and there\\'s just kind of a platform-driven demand?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, PC gaming is growing, I mean, there\\'s no question about that. The eSports is growing. The number of players in eSports, the number of people who are enjoying eSports is growing. Mobile is growing. I think it\\'s amazing. It\\'s amazing, the growth of mobile and the latest games. And of course, the first-party titles, the AAA titles are doing great work. Battlefield is doing great and I\\'m looking forward to the new Battlefield. I\\'m looking forward to the new Star Wars and I\\'m looking forward to the first time that Destiny is coming to the PC. As you know, it was a super hit on console. But the first-generation Destiny wasn\\'t available on PCs and Destiny 2 is coming to the PC. So I think the anticipation is pretty great. So I would say that PC gaming continues to grow and it\\'s hard to imagine people...\\\\n(technical difficulty)\\\\naround in another amazing world. And so I think people are going to be amazed at how long the alternate reality of the video gaming market is going to continue to expand.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of the Vivek Arya from Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jen-Hsun, for my first one, it\\'s on the competitive landscape in your Datacenter business. There\\'s been more noise around FPGA or CPU or ASIC solutions also chasing the same market. What do you think is NVIDIA\\'s sustainable competitive advantage? And what role is CUDA playing in helping you maintain this lead in this business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Vivek, thanks for the question. First of all, it\\'s really important to understand that the data centers, the cloud service providers, the Internet companies, they all get kind of lumped together in one conversation. But obviously, the way they use computers are very different. There are 3 major pillars of computing up in the cloud -- or in large data centers. Hyperscale. The one pillar is just internal use of computing systems for developing, for training, for advancing artificial intelligence. That\\'s a high-performance computing problem. It\\'s a very complicated software problem. The algorithms are changing all the time. They\\'re incredibly complicated. The work that the AI researchers are doing are not trivial, and that\\'s why they\\'re in such great demand. And it\\'s also the reason why computing resources have to be provisioned to them, so that they can be productive. Having a scarce AI researcher waiting around for a computer to finish simulation or training is really quite unacceptable. And so that one -- that first pillar is the market that we -- is a segment of the...\\\\n(technical difficulty)\\\\nor gets strained, once the network is trained, it is put into production. Like for example, your Alexa speakers has a little tiny network inside. And so obviously, you can do inferencing on Alexa. It does voice recognition on the hot keyword. In the long term, your car will be able to do voice recognition and speech recognition. Are we okay? Are we still on?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I think the call got dropped.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, no, Vivek, I\\'m just -- I was wondering whether the phone line was cut or not. So anyways, I -- the second pillar is inferencing. And inferencing, inferencing as it turns out, is far, far less complicated than training. It\\'s 1 trillion times less complicated, 1 billion times -- 1 trillion times less complicated. And so once the network is trained, it can be deployed. And there are thousands of networks that are going to be running inside these hyperscale data centers, thousands of different networks, not one, thousands of different types. And they\\'re detecting all kinds of different kinds of things. They\\'re inferring all kinds of different things, classifying, predicting, all kinds of different things, whether it\\'s photo or voice or videos or searchers or whatnot. And in that particular case, our advantage -- in that particular case, the current incumbent is CPUs. The CPU is really the only processor at the moment that has the ability to basically run every single network. And I think that\\'s a real opportunity for us. And it\\'s a growth opportunity for us. And one would suggest that FPGA is as well. One would suggest that ASICs like TPUs -- TPUs and ASIC is as well. And I would urge you to come to the keynote tomorrow and maybe I\\'ll say a few words about that tomorrow as well. And then the last pillar is cloud service providers, and that\\'s basically the outward public cloud provisioning a computing approach. It\\'s not about provisioning inferencing. It\\'s not about provisioning GPUs. It\\'s really provisioning a computing platform. And that\\'s one of the reasons why the NVIDIA CUDA platform and all of our software stacks that we\\'ve created over time, whether it\\'s for deep learning or molecular dynamics or all kinds of high-performance computing codes or linear algebra or computer graphics, all of our different software stacks make our cloud computing platform valuable. And that\\'s why it\\'s become the industry standard for GPU computing. And so those are 3 different pillars of hyperscalers, and it\\'s just important to segment them so that we don\\'t get confused.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Very helpful. And as my quick follow-up, Jen-Hsun, there is a perception that your gaming business has been driven a lot more by pricing and adoption of more premium products, and hence, there could be some kind of ceiling to how much gamers are willing to pay for these products. Could you address that? Are you seeing the number of gamers and the number of cards grow? And how long can they continue to reach for more premium product?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The average selling price of the NVIDIA GeForce is about 1/3 of a game console. That\\'s the way to think about it. That\\'s the simple math. People are willing to spend $200, $300, $400, $500 for a new game console. And the NVIDIA GeForce GPU, the PC gaming card is, on average, far less. There are people who just absolutely demand the best. And the reason for that is because they\\'re driving a monitor or they\\'re driving multiple monitors at a refresh rate well beyond the TV. And so if you have a 4K or you want to run 120 hertz, or some people are even driving at the 2 and 4 -- 200 hertz, those kind of displays demand a lot more horsepower to drive than an average television, whether it\\'s 1080p or 4K, at 60 frames per second or 30 frames per second. And so the amount of horsepower they need is great. But that\\'s just because they just really love their rig and they\\'re surrounded in it and they just want the best. But the way to think about that is ultimately, that\\'s the opportunity for us. I think GeForce is a game console, and the right way to think about that is at an equivalent ASP of some $200, $300, that\\'s probably potentially the opportunity ahead for GeForce.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Senior Equity Research Analyst and Fundamental Research Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess first question is around Gaming. And I was hoping you could kind of walk through how you\\'re thinking about seasonality here in calendar \\'17, particularly as Pascal launch calendarizes and you get both the launch coming, I presume, early \\'18. I would love to hear your thoughts on how we should think about the trajectory of that business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, first of all, GeForce is sold a unit at a time. And it\\'s sold all over the world and it\\'s a consumer product. It\\'s a product that I -- that is sold both into our installed base as well as growing our installed base. When we think about GeForce, they\\'re -- these are the parameters involved. How much of our installed base has upgraded to Pascal? How much of our installed base is growing? How is Gaming growing overall? How is -- what are the driving dynamics of Gaming, whether it\\'s eSports or mobile or using games for artistic expression? It\\'s related to the AAA titles that are coming out. Some years, the games are just incredible. Some years, the games are less incredible. These days, the production quality of the games have just become systematically so good that we\\'ve had years now of blockbuster hits. So these are really good dimensions of it. And then there is -- it\\'s overlaid on top of it with some seasonality because people do buy graphics cards and game consoles for Christmas and the holidays and there are international holidays where people are given money as gifts and they save up the money for a new game console or a new game platform. And so in a lot of ways, our business is driven by games. So it\\'s not unlike the characteristics of the rest of the gaming industry.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Senior Equity Research Analyst and Fundamental Research Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, on the inventory side, that grew, I think, 3% sequentially. Can you walk through the moving parts there? What\\'s driving that? And is foundry diversification part of that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The driving reasons for inventory growth is new products. And I -- that\\'s probably all I had to say for now. I would come to GTC. Come to the keynote tomorrow. I think it will be fun.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD     [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jen-Hsun, can you maybe talk a little bit about the breadth of your customer base in Datacenter relative to maybe 12 months ago? Are you seeing kind of the same customer group buying more GPUs? Or is it the growth in your business more a function of the broadening of your customer base?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Toshiya. Let me think here. I think 1 year ago, 1 year ago was -- maybe it was 2 years ago, maybe it\\'s somewhere between 18 months ago or so when I think Jeff Dean gave a talk where he said that Google was using a lot of GPUs for deep learning. I think it wasn\\'t much longer ago than that. And really, really, that was the only public customer that we had in the hyperscale data center. Fast forward a couple of years, we now have basically everybody. Every hyperscaler in the world is using NVIDIA for either deep learning, for some announcements that you\\'ll read about in data center deployment, tomorrow hopefully, and then a lot of them have now standardized on provisioning the NVIDIA architecture in the cloud. And so I guess in the course of 1 or 2 years, we went from basically hyperscale being an insignificant part of our overall business to quite a large part of our business, and as you could see also, the fastest-growing part of the business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD     [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then as my follow-up, I had a question for Colette. 3 months ago, I think you went out of your way to guide Datacenter up sequentially. And for the July quarter, ex the Intel business going away, you\\'re guiding revenue up 3% sequentially. Can you maybe provide some additional color for the individual segments?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - CFO and EVP    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks for the question. We feel good about the guidance that we\\'re providing for Q2. We wanted to make sure those understood the impact of Intel that\\'s incorporated in there. It\\'s still too early given that it\\'s just about the same size as what we just finished in Q1 to make comments specifically exactly where we think each one of those businesses will end up. But again, we do believe Datacenter is a super great opportunity for us. I think you\\'ll hear more about that tomorrow. But we don\\'t have any more additional details on our guidance. But we feel good about the guidance we gave.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Semiconductor Capital Equipment and Specialty Semiconductor Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jen-Hsun, can you talk about the adoption of GPU in the cloud? At the CES earlier this year, you guys announced GeForce. Now curious how the adoption of GeForce is going.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Atif, thanks for the question. GeForce NOW is a really -- it\\'s really an exciting platform. It virtualizes GeForce. It puts it in the cloud, turns it into a gaming PC as a service -- that can be streamed as a service. And we are -- I said at GTC that around this time, that we\\'ll likely open it up for external beta. We\\'ve been running internal beta for some time. And we\\'ll shortly go to external beta. And last time I checked, there\\'s many, many, tens of thousands of people who are signed up for external beta trials. And so I\\'m looking forward to letting people try it. But the important thing to realize about that is I -- that\\'s still years away from really becoming a major gaming service. And that\\'s -- it\\'s still years away from being able to find the right balance between cost and quality of service and the pervasiveness of virtualizing a gaming PC. So we\\'ve been working on it for several years and these things take a while. My personal experience is almost every great thing takes about a decade. And if that\\'s so, then we\\'ve got a few more years to go.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Semiconductor Capital Equipment and Specialty Semiconductor Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. As a follow-up, with your win and success in Nintendo Switch, does that open up the console market with other console makers? Is that a business that is of interest to you?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, consoles is not really a business to us. It\\'s a business to them. And we\\'re selected to work on these consoles. And if it makes sense and the strategic alignment is great and we\\'re in a position to be able to do it -- because the opportunity cost of building a game console is quite high. The number of engineers who knows how to build computing platforms like this -- and in the case of the Nintendo Switch, I mean, it\\'s just an incredible console that fits in such a small, small form factor. And it could both be a mobile computing -- mobile gaming device as well as a console gaming device. It\\'s just really quite amazing. And they just did an amazing job. Somebody asked me a few months ago before it was launched how I thought it was going to do. And of course, without saying anything about it, I said that it delighted me in a way that no game console has done in the last 10, 15 years. And it\\'s true. I mean, this is a really, really innovative product and really quite a genius. And if you ever have a chance to get it in your hands, it\\'s just really, really delightful. And so in that case -- in that case, the opportunity to work on it was just really, really too enticing. We really wanted to do it. And -- but it always requires deep strategic thought because it took several hundred engineers to work on. And they could be working on something else like all of the major initiatives we have. And so we have to be mindful about the strategic opportunity cost that goes along with these. But in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it\\'s just a home run. I\\'m so glad I did it. And it was a perfect collaboration for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Andrew Ellis,  B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior MD and Director of Research    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wanted to follow up on some of the prepared comments on Automotive with my first question. And it\\'s this. I think Colette mentioned that there were 225 car and truck development engagements that were underway, up 50% in the last quarter. The question is, as you engage with those partners, what\\'s NVIDIA finding in terms of the time from engagement to revenue generation? And what are you finding with your hit rate in terms of converting those individual engagements into revenues?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I know the second one: easier. Not -- the second one is the revenue contribution is not significant at the time, at this moment. But I expect it to be high. And that\\'s why we\\'re working on it. The 200 developers who are working on the DRIVE PX platform are doing it in a lot of different ways. And at the core, it\\'s because in the future, every aspect of transportation will be autonomous. And if you think through what\\'s going on in the world and one of the most important -- one of the most powerful effects that\\'s happening right now is the Amazon effect. We\\'re grabbing our phone. We\\'re buying something and then we expect it to be delivered to us tomorrow. Well, in -- when you sent up that -- those set of electronic instruction, the next thing that has to happen is a whole bunch of trucks has to move around. And they have to go from trucks to maybe smaller trucks and from smaller trucks to maybe a small van that ultimate delivers it to your house. And so if you will, transportation is the physical Internet, is the atomic Internet, the molecular Internet of society. And without it, everything that we\\'re experiencing today would be able to continue to scale. And so you could imagine everything from autonomous trucks to autonomous cars, surely, and autonomous shuttles and vans and motorcycles and small piece of delivery robots and drones and things like that. And for a long time, it\\'s going to augment truck drivers and delivery professionals who, quite frankly, we just don\\'t have enough of. The world is just growing too fast in an instant delivery, delivered to your home, delivered to you right now phenomenon. And we just don\\'t have enough delivery professionals. And so I think autonomous capability is going to make it possible for us to take pressure off of that system and reduce the amount of accidents and make it possible for that entire infrastructure to be a lot more productive. And so that\\'s one of the reasons why you\\'re seeing so much enthusiasm. It\\'s not just the branded cars. I think the branded cars get a lot of attention and we are excited about our partnerships there. And gosh, I love driving autonomous cars. But in the final analysis, I think the way to think about the autonomous future is every aspect of mobility and transportation and delivery will be -- will have autonomous -- will be augmented by AI.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Andrew Ellis,  B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior MD and Director of Research    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s very helpful color, Jen-Hsun. The follow-up is related to the Datacenter business. And you provided a lot of very useful customer and other information. My question is higher level. Given your very unique position in helping to nurture AI for the last many years and your deep insights into the way the customers are adopting it, as investors try and understand the sustainability of recent growth, can you help us understand where you believe AI adoption is overall? And since Colette threw out a baseball comment earlier, if we thought about AI adoption in reference to a 9-inning game, where are we in that 9-inning game?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, let\\'s see here. There\\'s a -- it\\'s a great question and there\\'s a couple of ways to come at it. First of all, AI is going to infuse all of software. AI is going to eat software. Whereas Mark said that software is going to eat the world, AI is going to eat software. And it\\'s going to be in every aspect of software. Every single software developer has to learn deep learning. Every single software developer has to apply machine learning. Every software developer will have to learn AI. Every single company will use AI. AI is the automation of automation. And it\\'s -- will likely be the transmission. We\\'re going to, for the first time, see the transmission of automation, the way we\\'re seeing the transmission and the wireless broadcast of information for the very first time. And I\\'m going to be able to send you automation, send you a little automation by e-mail. And so the ability for AI to transform industry is well understood now. It\\'s really about automation of everything. And the implications of it is quite large. We\\'ve been using now deep learning. We\\'ve been in the area of deep learning for about 6 years. And the rest of the world has been focused on deep learning for about somewhere between 1 to 2. And some of them are just learning about it. And almost no companies today use AI in a large way. So on the one hand, we know now that the technology is of extreme value. And we under -- we\\'re getting a better understanding of how to apply it. On the other hand, no industry uses it at the moment. The automotive industry is in the process of being revolutionized because of it. The manufacturing industry will be. Everything in transport will be. Retail, Etail everything will be. And so I think the impact is going to be large and we just -- we\\'re just getting started. We\\'re just getting started. Now that\\'s kind of a first inning thing. The only trouble with the baseball analogy is that in the world of tech, things don\\'t -- every inning is not the same. In the beginning, the first inning feels like -- it feels pretty casual and people are enjoying peanuts. The second inning, for some reason, is shorter. And the third inning is shorter than that and the fourth inning is shorter than that. And the reason for is because of exponential growth. Speed is accelerating. And so from the bystander who are on the outside looking in, by the time third inning comes along, it\\'s going to feel like people are traveling at the speed of light next to you. Now if you happen to be on one of the photons, you\\'re going to be okay. But if you\\'re not on the deep learning train in a couple of 2, 3 innings, it\\'s gone. And so that\\'s kind of the challenge of that analogy because things aren\\'t moving in linear time. Things are moving in exponential time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jen-Hsun, can you give us like a State of the Union on process node and technology road maps you guys see? And tell me a pretty nice exposition of where they are in terms of their transistors and so on? So what\\'s your comfort level as you see your process technology and your road maps for new GPUs?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Hans. I think there\\'s a couple of ways to think about it. First of all, we know that this is the -- we know that some -- the world causes the end of Moore\\'s Law, but it\\'s really the end of 2 dynamics that has happened. And one dynamic, of course, is the end of processor architecture productive innovation, okay, end of instruction-level parallelism advances. The second is the end of Dennard scaling. And the combination of those 2 things makes it look like it\\'s the end of Moore\\'s Law. The easy way to think about that is -- the easy way to think about that is that we can no longer rely -- if we want to advance computing performance, we can no longer rely on transistor advances alone. That\\'s one of the reasons why NVIDIA has never been obsessed about having the latest transistors. We want the best transistors. There\\'s no question about it. But we don\\'t need it to advance. And the reason for that is because we advance computing on such a multitude of levels all the way from architecture, this architecture we call GPU accelerate computing, to the software stacks on top, to the algorithms on top, to the applications that we work with. We tune it across the top, from the top to bottom, all the way from bottom to top. And so as a result, transistors is just one of the 10 things that we use. And like I said, it\\'s really, really important to us and I want the best. And TSMC provides us the absolute best that we can get. And we push along with them as hard as we can. But in the final analysis, it\\'s one of the tools in the box.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have attended GTC the last couple of days. I\\'m really quite impressed by the breadth of presentations and sort of the number of industries you guys are affecting. And I guess just on that note, how do you think about segmenting the sales effort? Do you have a health care vertical, an avionics vertical, financial vertical? Or is it sort of having the best building blocks and you\\'re letting your customers discover stuff?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, Joe. You answered it right there. It\\'s both of those. It\\'s both of those. On the first -- the first thing is that we have to develop platforms that are useful per industry. And so we have a team working with the health care industry. We have a team that\\'s working with the Internet service providers. We have a team that\\'s working with the manufacturing industry. We have a team that\\'s working with the financial services industry. We have a team that\\'s working with media and entertainment and with enterprise, so -- with the automotive industry. And so we have different verticals. We call them verticals and we have teams of business development people, developer relations, computational mathematicians that works with each one of the industries to optimize their software for our GPU computing platform. And so it starts with developing a platform stack. Of course, one of the most famous examples of that is our Gaming business. It\\'s just another vertical for us. And it starts with GameWorks that runs on top of GeForce and then it has its own ecosystem of partners. And so that\\'s for each one of the verticals and each one of the ecosystems. And then the second thing that we do is we have, horizontally, partner management teams that work with our partners, the OEM partners and the go-to-market partners so that we could help them succeed. And then, of course, we rely a great deal on the extended sales force of our partners so they could help to evangelize our computing platform all over the world. And so there\\'s this mixed approach between dedicated vertical market, business development teams as well as a partnership approach to partnering with our OEM partners that has really made our business scale so fast.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. That\\'s helpful. And then the other question I had was regarding Colette\\'s comment that HPC had doubled year-on-year. Just wondering if you have any comments on what drove that. And is that an indication of the supercomputer types of businesses? Or are there sort of other dynamics in terms of addressing new workloads with HPC products?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, HPC is different than supercomputing. Supercomputing to us is a collection of -- not a collection but is 20 different supercomputing sites around the world. And some of the famous ones, whether it\\'s Oak Ridge or Blue Water at UCSC, you\\'ve got TiTech in Japan, there are supercomputing centers that are either national supercomputing centers or they could be public and open supercomputer centers or open science. And so we consider those supercomputing centers. High-performance computing is used by companies who are using simulation approaches to develop products or to, well, to simulate something. It could be scenarios for predicting equity, or, for example, as you guys know, Wall Street is the home of some of the largest supercomputing center -- or high-performance computing centers. The energy industry, Schlumberger, for example, is a great partner of ours and they have a massive, massive high-performance computing infrastructure. And Procter & Gamble uses high-performance computers to simulate their products. And so I think last year, McDonald\\'s was at GTC and I hope they come this year as well. And so I think high-performance computing, another way of thinking about it is that more and more people really have to use simulation approaches for product discovery and product design and product simulation and stuff to stress the products beyond what is possible in a physical way so that they understand the tolerance of the products to make sure they are as reliable as possible.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just curious, Jen-Hsun, we\\'ve seen half dozen, dozen private companies going after the (inaudible) silicon Google TPU. I know you felt the comparison to a TPU maybe wasn\\'t fair. But I was just kind of curious to your response to these claims of a 10, 100, 500x performance better than a GPU.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, it\\'s not that it\\'s not fair. It\\'s just not right. It\\'s not correct. And so in business, who cares about being fair? And so I wasn\\'t looking for fair. I was just looking for right. And so the data has to be correct. It turns out -- and I said earlier that our hyperscale businesses have 3 different pillars. There\\'s training, which our GPUs are quite good at. There\\'s cloud service provision, which is a GPU computing architecture opportunity where CUDA is really the reason why people are adopting it and all the applications that have been -- that has adopted CUDA over the years. And then there\\'s inferencing. And inferencing is a 0 opportunity for us, a 0 business for us at the moment. I mean, we do 0% of our business in inferencing and it\\'s 100% on CPUs. And in the case of Google, they did a great thing and built a TPU as an ASIC. And they compared the TPU against one of our older GPUs. And so I published a blog. I wrote a blog to clarify some of the comparisons and you could look that up. But the way to think about that is our Pascal is probably approximately twice the performance of the TPU, the first generation TPU. And it\\'s incumbent upon us to continue to drive the performance of inferencing. This is something that\\'s still kind of new for us. And tomorrow, I\\'m probably going to say a few words about inferencing and maybe introduce a few ideas. But inferencing is new to us. It\\'s -- there are 10 million CPUs in the world in a cloud, and today, many of them are running Hadoop and doing queries and looking up files and things like that. But in the future, the belief is that the vast majority of the world\\'s cloud queries will be inference queries, will be AI queries. Every single query that goes into the cloud will likely have some artificial intelligence network that it processes. And I think that\\'s our opportunity. We have an opportunity to do inferencing better than anybody in the world and it\\'s up to us to prove it. At the moment, I think it\\'s safe to say that the P40, the Tesla P40, is the fastest on the planet, period. And then from here on forward, it\\'s incumbent upon us to continue to lean into that and do a better, better job.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then just moving to the gaming GPU side. I was just wondering if you could just talk about the competitive landscape, looking back at the last refresh and then looking forward into the back half of this year. I think your competitor\\'s going to have a new platform. Just kind of curious to your thought as to how the share worked out on the previous refresh and then the competitiveness into the second half of this year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          My assessment is that the competitive position is not going to change.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your last question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I just have one actually on the gaming side. I remember at CES, you had mentioned kind of a leasing model, almost effectively kind of target the low-end consumers of gaming products. So just wondering if that\\'ll be some sort of catalyst the back half. So how do we think about gaming working out in terms of both the leasing model and the year-over-year comparisons getting a bit difficult?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President and Director    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Mitch, yes, I was just talking about that earlier in one of the questions. It\\'s called GeForce NOW and I announced it at CES. And I said that right around this time of the year, we\\'re going to open it up for external beta. We\\'ve been running internal beta and closed beta for some time. And so we\\'re looking forward to opening up the external beta. My expectation is that it\\'s going to be some time as we scale that out. It\\'s going to take several years. I don\\'t think it\\'s something that\\'s going to be an overnight success. And as you know, overnight successes don\\'t happen overnight. However, I\\'m optimistic about the opportunity to extend the GeForce platform beyond the gamers that we currently have in our installed base. There are several billion gamers on the planet and I believe that every human will be a gamer someday. And every human will have some way to enjoy an alternative universe some way, someday. And we would love to be the company that brings it to everybody. And the only way to really do that on a very, very large-scale basis and reach all those people is over the cloud. And so I think our PC gaming business is going to continue to be quite vibrant. It\\'s going to continue to advance. And then hopefully, we can overlay our cloud reach on top of that over time.\\\\nWell, thanks for all the questions today. I really appreciate it. We had another record quarter. We saw growth across our 4 market platforms. AI is expanding. Datacenter nearly tripled. Large ISP, CSP deployments everywhere. PC gaming is still growing; eSports, AAA gaming titles, fueling our growth there. And we have great games on the horizon. Autonomous vehicles, becoming imperative on all sectors of transportation, as we talked about earlier. We have a great position with our DRIVE AI computing platform. And as Moore\\'s Law continues to slow, GPU accelerated computing is becoming more important than ever and NVIDIA is at the center of that. \\\\nDon\\'t miss tomorrow\\'s GTC keynote. We\\'ll have exciting news to share, next-generation AI, self-driving cars, exciting partnerships and more. Thanks, everybody.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This concludes today\\'s conference call.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Simona. This is a big week for NVIDIA. We just announced the biggest leap in GPU architecture in over a decade. We can\\'t wait to tell you more about it, but first, let\\'s talk about the quarter.\\\\nWe had another strong quarter, led by data center and gaming. Q2 revenue reached $3.12 billion, up 40% from a year earlier. Each market platform -- gaming, data center, pro visualization and automotive hit record levels -- with strong growth both sequentially and year-on-year. These platforms collectively grew more than 50% year-on-year. Our revenue outlook had anticipated cryptocurrency-specific products declining to approximately $100 million while actual crypto-specific product revenue was $18 million, and we now expect a negligible contribution going forward.\\\\nGross margins grew nearly 500 basis points year-on-year while both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. Profit nearly doubled. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 40% from last year to $2.66 billion. Tegra processor revenue grew 40% to $467 million.\\\\nLet\\'s start with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up 52% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially. Growth was driven by all segments of the business with desktop, notebook and gaming consoles up all strong double-digit percentages year-on-year.\\\\nNotebooks were a standout this quarter, with strong demands for thin and light form factors based on our Max-Q technology. Max-Q enables gaming PC OEMs to pack a high-performance GPU into a slim notebook that is just 20 millimeters thick or less. All major notebook OEMs and ODMs have adopted Max-Q for their top-of-the-line gaming notebooks, just in time for back-to-school. And we expect to see 26 models based on Max-Q in stores for the holidays.\\\\nThe gaming industry remains vibrant. The eSports audience now approaches 400 million, up 18% over the past year. The unprecedented success of Fortnite and PUBG has popularized this new battle royale genre and expanded the gaming market. In fact, the battle royale mode is coming to games like the much-anticipated Battlefield V. We are thrilled to partner with EA to make GeForce the best PC-gaming platform for the release of Battlefield V in October.\\\\nWe have also partnered with Square Enix to make GeForce the best platform for its upcoming Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Monster Hunter: World arrived on PCs earlier this month and it was an instant hit. And many more titles are lined up for what promises to be a big holiday season.\\\\nIt\\'s not just new titles that are building anticipation. The gaming community is excited over the Turing architecture announced earlier this week at SIGGRAPH. Turing is our most important innovation since the invention of the CUDA GPU over a decade ago. The architecture includes new dedicated ray-tracing processors or RT cores and new Tensor Cores for AI inferencing, which together will make real-time ray-tracing possible for the first time. We will enable the cinematic quality gaming, amazing new effects powered by neural networks and fluid interactivity on highly complex models.\\\\nTuring will reset the look of video games and open up the 250 billion visual effects industries to GPUs. Turing is the result of more than 10,000 engineering years to -- of effort. It\\'s -- delivers up to 6x performance increase over Pascal for ray-traced graphics and up to 10x boost for peak inference flops. This new architecture will be the foundation of a new portfolio of products across our platforms going forward.\\\\nMoving to data center. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $760 million, accelerating to 83% year-on-year growth and up 8% sequentially. This performance was driven by hyperscale demand as Internet services used daily by billions of people increasingly leverage AI. Our GPUs power real-time services such as search, voice recognition, voice synthesis, translation, recommender engines, fraud detection and retail applications.\\\\nWe also saw a growing adoption of our AI and high-performance computing solutions by vertical industries, representing one of the most fastest areas of growth in our business. Companies in sectors ranging from oil and gas to financial services through transportation are harnessing the power of AI and our accelerating computing platform to turn data into actionable insights.\\\\nOur flagship Tensor Core GPU, the Tesla V100, based on Volta architecture, continue to ramp for both AI and high-performance computing applications. Volta has been adopted by every major cloud provider and hyperscale data center operator around the world. Customers have quickly moved to qualify the new version of V100, which doubled the on-chip DRAM to 32 gig to support much larger data sets and neural networks. Major server OEMs, HP Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo, Cray and Supermicro also brought the V100 32-gig to market in the quarter.\\\\nWe continue to gain traction with AI inference solution, which helped expand our addressable market in the data center. During the quarter, we released our TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software for general availability. While prior versions of the TensorRT optimized image and video-related workloads, TensorRT 4 expands the aperture to include more use cases, such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation and recommendation systems. This means we can now address a much larger portion of deep learning inference workloads, delivering up to 190x performance speed-up, relative to CPUs.\\\\nNVIDIA and Google engineers have integrated TensorRT into the TensorFlow deep learning framework, making it easier to run AI inference on our GPUs. And Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA Tesla P4 GPU, our small form factor GPU for AI inference and graphic virtualization, is available on Google Cloud Platform.\\\\nData center growth was also driven by DGX, our fully optimized AI server, which incorporates V100 GPUs, our proprietary high-speed interconnect and our fully optimized software stack. The annual run rate for DGX is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. DGX-2, announced in March at our GPU Technology Conference, is being qualified by customers and is on track to ramp in the third quarter.\\\\nAt GTC Taiwan in June, we announced that we are bringing DGX-2 technology to our HGX-2 server platform. We make HGX-2 available to OEM and ODM partners so they can quickly deploy our newest innovations in their own server designs. In recent weeks, we announced partnerships with NetApp and Pure Storage to help customers speed AI deployment from months to days or even hours, with highly integrated optimized solutions that combine DGX with the company\\'s all-flash storage offerings and third-party networking.\\\\nAt GTC Taiwan, we also revealed that we are -- set 5 speed records for AI training and inference. Key to our strategy is our software stack. From CUDA to our training and inference SDKs as well as our work with our developers to accelerate their applications, it is the reason we can achieve such dramatic performance gains in such a short period of time.\\\\nAnd our developer ecosystem is getting stronger. In fact, we just passed 1 million members in our developer program, up 70% from 1 year ago. One of our proudest moments this quarter was the launch of the Summit AI supercomputer in Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Summit is powered by over 27,000 Volta Tensor Core GPUs and helped the U.S. reclaim the #1 spot on the TOP500 Supercomputer list for the first time in 5 years.\\\\nOther NVIDIA power systems joined the TOP500 list were Sierra at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the third spot, and the ABCI, Japan\\'s fastest supercomputer, in the fifth spot. NVIDIA now powers 5 of the world\\'s 7 fastest supercomputers, reflecting the broad shift in supercomputing to GPUs. Indeed, the majority of the computing performance added to the latest TOP500 list comes from NVIDIA GPUs, and more than 550 HPC applications are now GPU accelerated. With our Tensor Core GPUs, supercomputers can now combine simulation with the power of AI to advance many scientific applications from molecular dynamics to seismic processing to genomics and materials science.\\\\nMoving to pro visualization. Revenue grew to $281 million, up 20% year-on-year and 12% sequentially, driven by demand for real-time rendering and mobile workstations as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 35% of pro visualization sales. Strength extended across several key industries, including health care, oil and gas and media and entertainment. Key wins in the quarter include Raytheon, Lockheed, GE, Siemens and Philips Healthcare.\\\\nIn announcing the Turing architecture at SIGGRAPH, we also introduced the first Turing-based processors, the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs, bringing interactive ray tracing to the world years before it has been predicted. We also announced that the NVIDIA RTX server, a full ray-tracing global illumination rendering server that will give a giant boost to the world\\'s render farms as Moore\\'s Law ends.\\\\nTuring is set to revolutionize the work of 5 -- 50 million designers and artists, enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real time and add new AI-based capabilities to their work flows. Quadro GPUs based on the Turing will be available in the fourth quarter. Dozens of leading software providers, developers and OEMs have already expressed support for Turing. Our pro viz partners view it as a game-changer for professionals in the media and entertainment, architecture and manufacturing industries.\\\\nFinally, turning to automotive. Revenue was a record $161 million, up 13% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagements around the globe as well as the ramp of next-generation AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions.\\\\nWe continue to make progress on our autonomous vehicle platform with key milestones and partnerships announced this quarter. In July, Daimler and Bosch selected DRIVE Pegasus as the AI brain for their Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous fleets. Pilot testing will begin next year in Silicon Valley. This collaboration brings together NVIDIA\\'s leadership in AI and self-driving platforms, Bosch\\'s hardware and systems expertise as the world\\'s largest Tier 1 automotive supplier and Daimler\\'s vehicle expertise and global brand synonymous with safety and quality.\\\\nThis quarter, we started shipping development systems for DRIVE Pegasus, an AI supercomputer designed specifically for autonomous vehicles. Pegasus delivers 320 trillion operations per second to handle diverse and redundant algorithms and is architected for safety as well as performance. This automotive-grade functionally safe production solution uses 2 NVIDIA Xavier SoCs and 2 next-generation GPUs designed for AI and visual processing, delivering more than 10x greater performance and 10x higher data bandwidth compared to the previous generation. With co-designed hardware and software, the platform is created to achieve ASIL D ISO 26262, the industry\\'s highest level of automotive functional safety.\\\\nWe have created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of automated and autonomous driving from traffic jam pilots to Level 5 robo-taxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are using NVIDIA\\'s automotive platform. With this growing momentum and accelerating revenue growth, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for autonomous driving business.\\\\nThis quarter, we also introduced our Xavier platform for Jetson for the autonomous machine market. With more than 9 billion transistors, it delivers over 30 trillion operations per second, more processing capability than a powerful workstation while using 1/3 the energy of a lightbulb. Jetson Xavier establishes customers to deliver AI computing at the edge, powering autonomous machines like robots or drones with applications in manufacturing, logistics, retail, agricultural, health care and more.\\\\nLastly, in our OEM segment, revenue declined by 54% year-on-year and 70% sequentially. This was primarily driven by the sharp decline of cryptocurrency revenues to fairly minimal levels.\\\\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP was 63.5%, in line with our outlook. GAAP operating expenses were $818 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $692 million, up 30% year-on-year. We can continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, AI and automotive.\\\\nGAAP net income was $1.1 billion and EPS was $1.76, up 89% and 91%, respectively, from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a tax rate near 7% compared to our outlook of 11%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.21 billion and EPS was $1.94, up 90% and 92%, respectively, from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross and operating margin expansion and lower taxes. Quarterly cash flow from operations was $913 million. Capital expenditures were $128 million.\\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We are including no contribution from crypto in our outlook. We expect revenue to be $3.25 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.6% and 62.8%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $870 million and $730 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $20 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million to $150 million.\\\\nFurther financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, I\\'d like to highlight some of the upcoming events for the financial community. We\\'ll be presenting at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 6 and meeting with the financial community at our GPU Technology Conferences in Tokyo on September 13 and Munich on October 10. And our next earnings calls to discuss our financial results is in the third quarter of 2019 will take place on November 15.\\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. (Operator Instructions) And operator, would you please poll for questions?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The question\\'s on ray tracing, to what extent is this creating new markets versus enabling greater capabilities in your existing markets?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Mark. So first of all, Turing, as you know, is the world\\'s first ray-tracing GPU. And it completes our new computer graphics platform, which is going to reinvent computer graphics altogether. It unites 4 different computing modes: rasterization, accelerated ray tracing, computing with CUDA and artificial intelligence. It uses these 4 basic methods to create imagery for the future. There\\'s 2 different -- 2 major ways that we\\'ll experience the benefits right away. The first is for the markets of visualization today, they require photorealistic images. Whether it\\'s an IKEA catalog or a movie or architectural engineering or product design, car design, all of these types of markets require photorealistic images. And the only way to really achieve that is to use ray tracing with physically based materials and lighting. The technology is rather complicated. It\\'s been computing-intensive for a very long time. And it wasn\\'t until now that we\\'ve been able to achieve it in a productive way. And so Turing has the ability to do ray tracing, accelerated ray tracing, and it also has the ability to combine very large frame buffers because these data sets are extremely large. And so that marketplace is quite large and it\\'s never been served by GPUs before until now. All of that has been run on CPU render farms, gigantic render farms in all these movie studios and service centers and so on and so forth. The second area where you\\'re going to see the benefits of ray tracing, we haven\\'t announced.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          If I could have a follow-up on the gaming side. Where do you think the industry is on creating content that leverages that kind of capability?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Mark, the -- at GTC this last year in March, GDC and GTC, we announced a brand-new platform called NVIDIA RTX. And this platform has those 4 computation methods that I described for generating images. We put that platform out with the support of Microsoft. They call it the Microsoft DirectX Raytracing and the major game engine companies. Epic has implemented real-time raytracing and the RTX into the Epic engine, the Unreal Engine. And at GDC and GTC, we demonstrated, for the very first time, on 4 Volta GPUs, on 4 Volta GPUs, the ability to do that. And it was the intention of -- to get this platform out to all of the game developers. And we\\'ve been working with game developers throughout this time.\\\\nThus, this week at SIGGRAPH, we announced Quadro, which is the first -- the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 -- the world\\'s first accelerated ray-tracing GPUs. And I demonstrated one Quadro running the same application that we demonstrated on 4 Volta GPUs running in March. And the performance is really spectacular. And so I think the answer to your question is developers all have access to RTX. It\\'s in Microsoft\\'s DirectX. It\\'s in the most popular game engine in the world, and you\\'re going to start to see developers use it. On the workstation side, on the professional visualization side, all of the major ISPs have jumped on to adopt it. And at SIGGRAPH this year, there you could see a whole bunch of developers demonstrating the NVIDIA RTX with accelerated ray tracing, generating photorealistic images. And so I would say that in no platform in our history has, on day 1 of announcement, had so many developers jump onto it. And stay tuned, we\\'ve got a lot more stories to tell you about RTX.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Colette, I had a couple of questions about inventory, the first of which is, I understand you\\'ve launched a new product set in pro viz, and the data center business is obviously ramping really strongly. But if you look at the balance sheet, I think the inventory level is up by around mid-30s percent sequentially and you\\'re guiding revenue up 3% or so. Maybe you could help us sort of walk through the contribution to that inventory and what it might mean for future products. And secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the gaming channel in terms of inventory, how things are looking in the channel as you guys see it during this period of product transition.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thanks for your question. So when you look at our inventory on the balance sheet, I think it\\'s generally consistent with what you have seen over the last several months in terms of what we will be bringing to market. Turing is an extremely important piece of architecture, and as you know, it will be with us for some time. So I think the inventory balance is getting ready for that. And don\\'t forget our work in terms of data center and what we have for Volta is also a very, very complex computer, in some cases, in terms of what we have also in terms of there. So just those things together, plus our Pascal architecture is still here, makes up almost all of what we have there in terms of inventory.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Matt, on the channel inventory side, we see inventory in the lower ends of our stack. And that inventory is well positioned for back-to-school and the building season that\\'s coming up on Q3. And so I feel pretty good about that. The rest of our product launches and the ramp-up of Turing is going really well. And so I think the rest of the announcements we haven\\'t made, but stay tuned. The RTX family is going to be a real game-changer for us and the reinvention of computer graphics altogether has been embraced by so many developers. We\\'re going to see some really exciting stuff this year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Actually, just a clarification and then a question. On the clarification, Colette, if you could also help us understand the gross margin sequencing from Q2 to Q3. And then, Jensen, how would you contrast the Pascal cycle, the Turing cycle? Because I think in your remarks, you mentioned Turing is a very strong advancement over what you had before. But when you launched Pascal, you had guided to very strong Q3s and then Q4s. This time, the Q3 outlook, even though it\\'s good on an absolute basis, on a sequential and a relative basis, it\\'s perhaps not as strong. So if you could just help us contrast the Pascal cycle with what we should expect with the Turing cycle.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, thanks for that -- for the question. Let me start first with your question regarding gross margins. We have essentially reached, as we move into Q3, a normalization of our gross margins. I believe, over the last several quarters, we have seen the impacts of crypto and what that can do to elevate our overall gross margins. We believe we have reached a normal period as we\\'re looking forward to essentially no cryptocurrency as we go forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let\\'s see, Pascal was really successful. Pascal, relative to Maxwell, was a leap in fact. And it was a really significant upgrade. The architectures were largely the same. They were both programmable shading, they were both at the same generation programmable shading. But Pascal was much, much more energy efficient. I think it was something like 30%, 40% more energy efficient than Maxwell, and that translated to performance benefits to customers. The success of Pascal was fantastic. There\\'s just simply no comparison to Turing. Turing is a reinvention of computer graphics. It is the first ray-tracing GPU in the world. It\\'s the first GPU that will be able to ray trace light in an environment and create photorealistic shadows and reflections and be able to model things like area lights and global illumination and indirect lighting. But the images are going to be so subtle and so beautiful, it -- when you look at it, it just looks like a movie. And yet it\\'s backwards compatible with everything that we\\'ve done.\\\\nThis new hybrid rendering model, which extends what we\\'ve built before but added to it 2 new capabilities, artificial intelligence and accelerated ray tracing, is just fantastic. So everything of the past will be brought along and benefits, and it\\'s going to create new visuals that were impossible before. We also did a good job on laying the foundations of the development platform for the developers. We\\'ve partnered with Microsoft to create DXR. Vulkan RT is also coming, and we have optics that are used by pro viz renderers and developers all over the world. And so we have the benefit of laying the foundation stack by stack by stack over the years. And as a result, on the day that Turing comes out, we\\'re going to have a richness of applications that gamers will be able to enjoy.\\\\nYou mentioned guidance. I actually think that on a year-over-year performance, we\\'re doing terrific. And I\\'m super excited about the ramp of Turing. It is the case that we benefited in the last several quarters from an unusual lift from crypto. In the beginning of the year, we thought and we projected that crypto would be a larger contribution through the rest of the year, but at this time, we consider it to be immaterial for the second half. And so that makes comparisons on a sequential basis on, I guess, a quarterly sequential basis harder. But on a year-to-year basis, I think we\\'re doing terrific. Every single one of our platforms are growing. High-performance computing, of course, data centers is growing. AI, the adoption continues to sweep from one industry to another industry. The automation that\\'s going to be brought about by AI is going to bring productivity gains to industries like nobody\\'s ever seen before.\\\\nAnd now with Turing, we\\'re going to be able to reignite the professional visualization business, open us up to photorealistic rendering for the very first time, render farms and everybody who\\'s designing products that has to visualize it photo realistically, to reinventing and resetting graphics for video games. And so I think we\\'re in a great position, and I\\'m looking forward to reporting Q3 when the time comes.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Semiconductor Capital Equipment & Specialty Semiconductor Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Colette, I have a question on data center. In your prepared remarks, you talked about AI and high-performance computing driving new verticals and some of these verticals are fastest growing. Some of your peers have talked about enterprise spending slowing down in the back half of this year and so unit demand, and you guys are not a unit play but more of an AI adoption. Just curious in terms of your thinking about second half data center growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So as you know, we generally give our view on guidance for 1 quarter out. You are correct that our data center results that we see is always a tremendous unique mix every single quarter in terms of what we\\'re seeing. But there\\'s still some underlying points of that, that will likely continue. The growth in terms of use by the hyperscales, continued industry by industry coming on board, essentially just because the needs of accelerated computing for the workloads and for the data that they have is so essential. So we still expect, as we go into Q3, for data center to grow both sequentially and year-over-year. And we\\'ll see probably a mix of both selling our Tesla V100 platforms but also a good contribution from our DGX.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, that\\'s right. Atif, let me just add a little bit more to that. I think the one simple way to think about that is this. In the transportation industry, let\\'s take one particular vertical. There are 2 dynamics that are happening that are very abundantly clear and that will transform that industry. The first, of course, is ride hailing and ride sharing. Those platforms, in order to make the recommendation of which taxi to bring to which passenger, to which customer, is a really large computing problem. It\\'s a machine-learning problem. It\\'s an optimization problem of very, very large scale. And in every -- in each and every one of those instances, you need high-performance computers to use machine learning to figure out how to make that perfect match or the most optimal match.\\\\nOn the second -- the second is self-driving cars. Every single car company that\\'s working on robot taxis or self-driving cars needs to collect data, label data, train a neural network or train a whole bunch of neural networks and to run those neural networks in cars. And so you just make your list of how many people are actually building self-driving cars. And every single one of them will need even more GPU-accelerated servers. And that\\'s just for developing the model. Then the next stage is to simulate the entire software. Because we know that the industry or the world travels 10 trillion miles per year, and the best we could possibly do is to drive several million normal miles. And what we really want to do is to be able to simulate and stress -- stress-test our software stack and the only way to do that is doing virtual reality. And so that\\'s another supercomputer that you have to build for simulating all your software costs, those billions and billions of virtually created, challenging miles.\\\\nAnd then lastly, before you OTA the software, you\\'re going to have to re-sim and replay against all of the miles that you\\'ve collected over the years to make sure that you have no regressions before you OTA the new models into a fleet of cars. And so transportation is going to be a very large industry. Health care is the same way, from medical imaging that is now using AI just about everywhere to genomics that has discovered deep learning and the benefits of artificial intelligence; and in the future, pathology. The list goes on. And so industry after industry after industry, we\\'re discovering the benefits of deep learning and the industries could be really, really revolutionized by it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess, short term and the long term. So for short term, as you think about your gaming guide, are you embedding any drawdown of channel inventory there? And then longer term, as you think about Turing Tensor Cores, can you talk a bit about differentiation versus Volta V100, particularly as you think about 8-bit integer and the opportunities there for inferencing?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We\\'re expecting the channel inventory to work itself out. We are masters at managing our channel, and we understand the channel very well. As you know, the way that we go to market is through the channels around the world. We\\'re not concerned about the channel inventory. As we ramp Turing, any -- whenever we ramp a new architecture, we ramp it from the top down. And so we have plenty of opportunities as the -- as we go back to the back-to-school and the gaming cycle to manage the inventory, so we feel pretty good about that. As a result, comparing Volta and Turing, CUDA\\'s compatible. That\\'s one of the benefits of CUDA. CUDA -- all of the applications that take advantage of CUDA that are written on top of cuDNN, which is our deep neural network platform, to TensorRT that takes advantage -- that takes the output of the frameworks and optimize it for run time. All of those tools and libraries run on top of Volta and run on top of Turing and run on top of Pascal.\\\\nWhat Turing adds over Pascal is the same Tensor Core that is inside Volta. Of course, Volta is designed for large-scale training. 8 GPUs could be connected together. They have the fastest HBM2 memories, and it\\'s designed for data center applications, has 64-bit double-precision ECC, high-resilience computing and all of the software and system software capability and tools that make Volta the perfect high-performance computing accelerator. In the case of Turing, it\\'s really designed for 3 major applications. The first application is to open up pro visualization, which is a really large market that has historically used render farms and were really unable to use GPUs until we now have the ability to do full path trace, global illumination with very, very large data sets. So that\\'s one market that\\'s brand new as a result of Turing.\\\\nThe second market is to reinvent computer graphics, real-time computer graphics, for video games and other real-time visualization applications. When you see the images created by Turing, you\\'re going to have a really hard time wanting to see the images of the past. It just looks amazing. And then the third, Turing has a really supercharged Tensor Core. And this Tensor Core is used for image generation. It\\'s also used for high throughput deep learning inferencing for data centers. And so these applications for Turing, which suggests that there are multiple SKUs of Turing, which is one of the reasons why we have such a great engineering team, we could scale one architecture across a whole lot of platforms at one time. And so I hope that answers your question. The Tensor Core inference capability of Turing is going to be off the charts.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wonder if you could talk about cryptocurrency now that the dust has settled. You guys have done a good job of kind of laying out exactly how much of the OEM business has been driven by that. But there\\'s also been, I think, some sense of -- some of the GeForce business was being driven by crypto. Can you -- looking backwards, can you size that for us? And I guess, I\\'m trying to understand the impact that crypto would have on the guidance for October, given that it seems like it was very small in the July quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, I think -- I mean, the second question is easier to answer, and the reason -- the first one is just -- it\\'s ambiguous and hard to predict anyway. It\\'s hard to estimate no matter what. But the second question, the answer is we\\'re expecting -- we\\'re projecting 0 basically. And for the first question, how much of GeForce could have been used for crypto, a lot of gamers at night, they could -- while they\\'re sleeping, they could do some mining. And so did they buy it for mining or did they buy it for gaming, it\\'s kind of hard to say. And some miners were unable to buy our OEM products, and so they jumped onto the market to buy it from retail. And that probably happened a great deal as well. And that all happened in the last -- the previous several quarters, probably starting from Q -- late Q3, Q4, Q1 and very little last quarter, and we\\'re projecting no crypto mining going forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had one for Jensen and one for Colette. Jensen, I was hoping you could remind us how meaningful your inference business is today within data center and how you would expect growth to come about over the next 2 years as you -- as your success at accounts like Google proliferate across a broader set of customers. And then for Colette, if you can give directional guidance for each of your platforms. I know you talked about data center a little bit, but if you can talk about the other segments. And on gaming specifically, if you can talk about whether or not new products are embedded in that guide.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Toshiya. Inference is going to be a very large market for us. It is surely material now in our data center business. It\\'s not the largest segment, but I believe it\\'s going to be a very large segment of our data center business. There are 30 million servers around the world, let\\'s kind of estimate, in the cloud, and there are a whole lot more in enterprises. I believe that almost every server in the future will be accelerated. And the reason for that is because artificial intelligence and deep learning software and neural net models are going to -- prediction models, are going to be infused into software everywhere. And acceleration has proven to be the best approach going forward. We\\'ve been laying the foundations for inferencing for a couple 2, 3 years. And as we\\'ve described at GTCs, inference is really, really complicated. And the reason for that is you have to take the output of these massive, massive networks that are output of the training frameworks and optimize it. This is the -- probably the largest computational graph optimization problem the world\\'s ever seen. And this is brand-new invention territory.\\\\nThere are so many different network architectures from CNNs to RCNNs to autoencoders to RNNs and LSTMs, there is just so many different species of neural networks these days, and it\\'s continuing to grow. And so the compiler technology is really, really complicated. And this year, we announced 2 things. Earlier this year, we announced that we\\'ve been successful in taking the Tesla P4 low-profile, high-energy efficiency inference accelerator into hyperscale data centers. And we announced our fourth generation TensorRT optimizing compiler -- neural network optimizing compiler. And TRT 4 goes well beyond CNNs and image recognition in the beginning. It now allows us to support and optimize for voice recognition or speech recognition, natural language understanding, recommendation systems, translation. And all of these applications are really pervasive from Internet services all over the world. And so now from images to video to voice to recommendation systems, we now have a compiler that can address it.\\\\nWe are actively working with just about every single Internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack. And the reason for that is because they need high throughput and, very importantly, they need low latency. Voice recognition is only useful if it responds in a relatively short period of time. And our platform is just really, really excellent for that. And then this last week -- this week, we announced Turing. And I announced that the inference performance of Turing is 10x the inference performance of Pascal, which is already a couple of hundred times the inference performance of CPUs. And so you take a look at the rate at which we\\'re moving, both in the support of new neural networks, the ever-increasing optimization and performance output of the compilers and the rate at which we\\'re advancing our processors, I think we\\'re raising the bar pretty high, okay? So with that, Colette?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So when you look at our overall segments, as you will have seen our results in terms of this last Q2, there was growth across every single one of our platforms from a year-over-year standpoint. We probably possibly see that again in our Q3 guidance, the year-over-year growth across each and every one of those platforms. Of course, our OEM business will be down likely year-over-year, again just due to the absence of cryptocurrency in our forecast. When we think about sequentially, our hopes is absolutely, our data center will grow and we\\'ll likely see the growth of our gaming business as well. It\\'s still early, still we\\'ve got many different scenarios and -- on our pro viz and auto. But definitely, our gaming and our data center are expected to grow sequentially.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Two on gross margin. Colette, I just want to make sure I understood, July to October gross margins down. I know you\\'ve been getting a benefit from crypto, but it\\'s pretty de minimis in July. Just is there any other moving pieces? And then kind of longer picture here, how do you think about the ramp of Turing affecting gross margins? You\\'re obviously enabling a lot of capabilities. You get paid for it, 12-nanometers, fairly stable. Just kind of curious how to think about over the next couple of quarters gross margin with that ramp.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So let me take your first part of the question regarding our gross margins and what we had seen from crypto. Although crypto revenue may not be large, it still has a derivative impact on our stock in terms of what we are selling in to both replenish the overall channel and such. So over the last several quarters that we had stabilizing that overall channel, we did get the great effect of selling just about everything, and our margin\\'s really been able to benefit from that. Again, when we look at the overall growth year-over-year for Q2, you have 500 basis points in terms of growth. We\\'re excited about what we have now here for Q3 as well, which is also significant growth year-over-year. Of course, we have our high value-added platforms as we move forward, both those in data center, those in terms of what we expect the effects of Turing in terms of -- on our Quadro piece as well. But that will take some time for that all to partake. So we\\'ll see how that goes. We haven\\'t announced anything further at this time. But yes, we\\'ll see probably over the longer term, the effects of what Turing can do.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m curious as we look at the data center business, if you can help us understand the breakdown of demand between hyperscale, the supercomputing piece of the business and the AIPs. And I guess, on top of that, I\\'m just curious, one of the metrics that\\'s pretty remarkable over the last couple of quarters is you\\'ve seen significant growth in China. I\\'m curious if that\\'s related to the data center business or what\\'s really driving that as kind of a follow-up question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Aaron, I think that if you look at the -- if you start from first principles, here\\'s the simple way to look at it. Demand is continuing to grow at historical levels of 10x computing demand. Computing demand is increasing at historical levels of 10x every 5 years. 10x every 5 years is approximately Moore\\'s Law. And computing demand continues to grow at 10x every 5 years, however, Moore\\'s Law stopped. And so that gap in the world in high-performance computing, in medical imaging, in life sciences computing, in artificial intelligence, that gap -- because those applications demand more computing capability, that gap can only be served in another way. And NVIDIA\\'s GPU accelerated computing that we pioneered really stands to benefit from that. And so at the highest level, whether it\\'s supercomputing -- and this year, you heard Colette say earlier that NVIDIA GPUs represented 56% of all the new performance that came into the world\\'s TOP500. The TOP500 is called the TOP500 because it reflects the future computing. And my expectation is that more and more, from one vertical industry after another -- and I mentioned transportation, I mentioned health care, the vertical industries go on and on -- that as computing demand continues at a factor of 10x every 5 years, developers are rational and logical to have jumped on NVIDIA\\'s GPU computing to boost their demand. I think that\\'s probably the best way to answer it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          When we think about cloud and hyperscale, we tend to think about the top guys, right? They\\'re designing their own platform using your Tesla-based products or sometimes even designing their own chips for AI and deep learning. But there\\'s a larger base of medium to smaller cloud and hyperscale customers out there who don\\'t have the R&D scale. And I think that\\'s where your HGX platform seems to be focused on. So Jensen, can you just give us an update on the uptake of your first-generation HGX-1 reference platform and the initial interest on the HGX-2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          HGX-1 was, I guess, kind of the prototype of HGX-2. HGX-2 is doing incredibly well for all the reasons that you mentioned. It is -- and even the largest hyperscale data centers can\\'t afford to create these really complicated motherboards at the scale that we\\'re talking about. And so we created HGX-2 and it was immediately adopted by several most important hyperscalers in the world. And we were at GTC Taiwan, and we announced basically all of the leading server OEMs and ODMs supporting HGX-2 and are ready to take it to market. So we\\'re in the process of finishing the -- finishing HGX-2 and ramping them into production. And so I think HGX-2 is a huge success for exactly the reasons that you mentioned. We could use it for essentially a standard motherboard like the ATX motherboard for PCs that could be used for hyperscalers, it could be used for HPC, it could be used for data centers. And it\\'s really -- it\\'s a really fantastic design. It just allows people to adopt this really complicated and high performance and really high-speed interconnect motherboard in a really easy way.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question is from Tim Arcuri with UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Actually, I had 2 questions, Jensen, both for you. First, now that crypto has fallen off, I\\'m curious what you think the potential is that maybe we see a slug of cards that get resold on eBay or some other channel and that could cannibalize new Pascal sales. Is that something that keeps you up at night? Number one. Number two, obviously, the stories about gaming and data center, and I know that you don\\'t typically talk about customers, but since Tesla did talk about you on their call, I\\'m curious what your comments are about the development for Hardware 3 and their own efforts to move away from your drive platform.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Well, the crypto mining market is very different today than it was 3 years ago. And even though new cards -- at the current prices, it doesn\\'t make much sense for new cards to be sold into the mining market. The existing capacity is still being used, and you could see that the hash rates continue. And so my sense is that the installed base of miners will continue to use their cards. And then probably the more important factor though is that we\\'re in the process of announcing a brand-new way of doing computer graphics. And with the -- with Turing and the RTX platform, computer graphics will never be the same. And so I think this -- our new generation of new GPUs is really going to do great.\\\\nI also think that -- I appreciate Elon\\'s comments about our company, and I also think Tesla makes great cars, and I drive them very happily. And with respect to the next generation, it is the case that when we first started working on autonomous vehicles, they needed our help. And we used the 3-year-old Pascal GPU for the current generation of autopilot computers. And it is very clear now that in order to have a safe autopilot system, we need a lot more computing horsepower. In order to have safe computing -- in order to have safe driving, the algorithms have to be rich, it has to be able to handle corner conditions in a lot of diverse situations. And every time that there\\'s more and more corner conditions or more subtle things that you have to do or you have to drive more smoothly or be able to take turns more quickly, all of those requirements require greater computing capability. And that\\'s exactly the reason why we built Xavier. Xavier is in production now. We\\'re seeing great success, and customers are super excited about Xavier. And that\\'s exactly the reason why we built it. And I think it\\'s super hard to build Xavier and all the software stack on top of it. And if it doesn\\'t turn out -- for whatever reason, it doesn\\'t turn out for them, he can give me a call, and I\\'d be more than happy to help.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Unfortunately, we have run out of time. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We had a great quarter. Our core platforms exceeded expectations even as crypto largely disappeared. Each of our platforms -- AI, gaming, pro viz and self-driving cars -- continue to enjoy great adoption. These markets are -- we are enabling are some of the most impactful to the world today. We launched Turing this week. It was 10 years in the making and completes the NVIDIA RTX platform. And NVIDIA RTX with Turing is the greatest advance since CUDA nearly a decade ago. I\\'m incredibly proud of our company for tackling this incredible challenge, reinventing the entire graphic stack and giving the industry a surge of excitement as we reinvent computer graphics. Stay tuned as we unfold the exciting RTX story. See you guys next time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you for joining.

The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and CFO commentary posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com.\\\\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements in today\\'s earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors and our filings with the SEC, and in particular AMD\\'s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2015.\\\\nNow with that, I would like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our strategy to improve our business by gaining share in the graphics and PC markets, growing our semi-custom business, and expanding into the data center market is progressing as planned. First-quarter revenue decreased in line with expectations to $832 million, driven largely by an anticipated reduction in semi-custom shipments.\\\\nLooking at our computing and graphics segment, against the backdrop of one of the largest sequential Q4-to-Q1 declines in the PC industry and ongoing softness in the Chinese PC market, we continue to execute our multi-quarter plan to improve the financial performance of this part of our business.\\\\nRevenue decreased 2% sequentially, as improved notebook processor, desktop GPU, and professional graphics sales offset declines for our other PC products. We reduced our operating loss from the prior quarter, outperformed the PC market, and believe we regained processor and GPU share. Importantly, we accomplished this while maintaining our disciplined approach to managing inventory in the quarter, as our inventories with M&Cs and downstream channel partners were flat to slightly down sequentially.\\\\nWe had our second straight quarter of double-digit sequential percentage growth in mobile APU sales. We began shipping our seventh-generation Bristol Ridge APUs in March, and have secured new design wins that continue our expansion into more premium notebook offerings, including HP\\'s new Envy x360 convertible notebook. Compared to our previous-generation 15-watt APU mobile offering, Bristol Ridge delivered a 20% improvement in our already industry-leading graphics performance and up to 20% CPU performance uplift.\\\\nIn graphics, we delivered a strong sequential double-digit percentage increase in desktop discrete unit shipments, largely driven by increased sales of our Radeon 300 series GPUs in the channel. Our investments in graphics and our focus on creating industry-leading drivers and software are starting to pay off. We have delivered seven new graphics drivers releases in the first quarter alone, not only improving the performance and user experience of our GPUs, but also adding support for new AAA game titles and features like our innovative XConnect external GPU technology.\\\\nWe expect to grow our investment in graphics throughout the year as we further update our graphics software and extend our leadership in Direct X12 gaming and VR. We believe VR will be a key long-term demand driver for AMD across both our consumer and professional graphics offerings, especially as content creators require more powerful GPUs to create fully immersive VR experiences.\\\\nTo capitalize on this trend, I am proud to share that we plan to launch the industry\\'s most powerful platform for VR creation and consumption at the end of this month, when we introduce the $1,500 Radeon Pro Duo.\\\\nWe remain on track to introduce our new 14 nanometer FinFET-based Polaris GPUs midyear. Polaris delivers double the performance per watt of our current mainstream offerings, which we believe provides us with significant opportunities to gain share.\\\\nNow, turning to our enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment. Revenue declined 24% sequentially due to lower semi-custom sales. Based on our current visibility, we expect semi-custom unit shipments and revenue to grow on an annual basis based on strong demand for game consoles and the ramp of our previously announced new business in the second half of the year.\\\\nIn embedded, we secured new designs across our target markets. Highlights from the quarter include our first significant CPU design win with one of the leading network infrastructure providers.\\\\nI am also pleased to share that we are making excellent progress on our strategy to reestablish our presence in the data center market as we successfully passed several key milestones related to our next-generation Zen-based server processor. The Zen silicon running in our bring-up labs is meeting our expectations, and priority customer sampling is on track to begin this quarter in advance of data center system availability in 2017.\\\\nOur EESC results in the quarter also benefited from the latest step in our strategic IP monetization efforts. As we\\'ve disclosed earlier today, we have licensed high-performance microprocessor technologies to a newly created JV we formed with THATIC. The JV will develop SoCs tailored to the Chinese server market. The $293 million licensing agreement is a great example of how our IP monetization efforts can accelerate the adoption of AMD technologies in key markets while also strengthening our balance sheet and financial results.\\\\nToday\\'s announcement is a key part of our overall strategy to reenter the data center market, with the JV providing AMD with a differentiated approach to gain share in the fastest-growing regional server market.\\\\nIn closing, we are making steady progress on the clear strategy we have developed to return AMD to growth and profitability through delivering great products. We are executing well to our product and technology roadmaps, including the introduction of our seventh-generation APUs, our midyear launch of new Polaris GPUs, and our future Zen-based processors.\\\\nAs we enter into the second quarter, we see strong demand for our semi-custom and graphics products, which we believe will lead to stronger-than-seasonal sequential revenue growth. For the full year, we are confident that our product portfolio and business execution can further strengthen our financial results and enable us to grow annual revenue and return to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year.\\\\nLonger term, we expect the strong customer interest in AMD\\'s data center offerings will result in new design wins that can deliver profitable revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.\\\\nNow, I would like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first-quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. From a financial perspective, the first quarter came in as expected. We continued funding our roadmap products and also made progress on our IP monetization strategy with the execution of a licensing agreement that is expected to generate $293 million of cash before tax, contingent upon achieving certain milestones.\\\\nLet me review the results for the first quarter. As a reminder, our first fiscal quarter was a 13-week quarter. Revenue was $832 million, down 13% sequentially, driven primarily by lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. The year-over-year decline was 19% due primarily to lower sales of semi-custom SoCs and client notebook processors.\\\\nGross margin was 32%, a 2 percentage point improvement from the prior quarter due primarily to a more favorable product mix and a mix of revenue between the business segments. Operating expenses were $332 million, up $9 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased R&D expenses related to new products, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. Operating expenses were $12 million higher than guided, primarily due to the timing of mass and hardware for our new products and some incremental investments in graphics.\\\\nOperating loss was $55 million and net loss was $96 million, with loss per share of $0.12, calculated using 793 million shares. We recognized a $7 million licensing gain associated with our IP monetization efforts in the quarter.\\\\nNet interest, other expense, and taxes were $41 million in the quarter, down from $53 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to a $13 million tax settlement in Q4 2015, which was included in the GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $22 million compared to negative $5 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments. Computing and graphics revenue was $460 million, down 2% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower desktop processor sales. Computing and graphics segment operating loss was $70 million compared to $99 million the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased operating expenses.\\\\nEnterprise, embedded, and semi-custom revenue was $372 million, down 24% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs. The operating income of this segment was $16 million, down from $59 million the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower revenue and higher R&D expenses, partially offset by the IP licensing gains.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $716 million at the end of the quarter, down $69 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales and higher debt interest payments of $69 million in Q1. Additionally, our Q1 results include $52 million net of taxes received from our IP licensing agreement. Inventory was $675 million, down $3 million from the end of the prior quarter.\\\\nTotal wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the first quarter were $183 million, including $155 million related to the 2015 WSA amendment taken in Q1 2016. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, including total borrowings of $230 million on our secured revolving line of credit, unchanged from the prior quarter. Free cash flow in the first quarter was negative $68 million compared to a positive $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\\\\nBefore providing our outlook for the second quarter, let me provide an update on our ATMP joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics. Earlier this month, NFME\\'s shareholders approved the transaction and we are currently in the final stages of obtaining regulatory approvals and expect to close the transaction this quarter.\\\\nNow turning to our outlook, which is based on a 13-fiscal-week quarter. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, driven by a strong demand for our semi-custom and graphics products.; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $335 million; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $25 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes, and other to be approximately $45 million, including approximately $3 million of taxes related to the IP licensing game; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately $950 million, including approximately $320 million related to our ATMP joint venture; inventory to be up slightly from first-quarter levels.\\\\nFor the full-year 2016, we continue to expect revenue to grow year over year, to be non-GAAP operating profitable in the second half of 2016, and to generate positive free cash flow from operations for 2016. Also, we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $330 million and $350 million per quarter; IP monetization licensing gain of approximately $52 million, with $7 million already recognized in Q1 2016; and capital expenditures of approximately $80 million. For the rest the full-year 2016 outlook, please refer to the written CFO commentary document posted on amd.com.\\\\nIn closing, we continue to strengthen AMD\\'s core business while leveraging our IP and technology. As we look to the rest of the year, we are focused on introducing compelling new products, regaining market share, and improving our financial performance.\\\\nWith that, I will turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  AMD - SVP Human Resources, Corporate Communications, and IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we would be very happy for you to poll the audience for questions, please.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Mark Lipacis, Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking my question. I guess this is one of the most exciting developments that we\\'ve heard about in awhile, the license agreement. And I was hoping that you could maybe provide some more color on that.\\\\nCould you help us understand, maybe just go back in time and just explain the cross-license agreement that you have with Intel? What should investors understand about that and assessing any kind of a risk associated with this IP agreement? Do you need to get -- do you check in -- do you tell Intel that this is going on, did you get clearance from them, or is this something that you just kind of run with?\\\\nAnd when do you -- do you have to wait for like regulatory approval to get this through? Or -- how should we think about timing and milestones? That is a lot of questions. I will stop there. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, Mark. This is Lisa. Thank you for your question. Regarding the JV that we just announced, yes, we are very excited about it, partnering with THATIC, and really focusing on the Chinese market for server processors.\\\\nWhat we are licensing in this agreement is microprocessor technologies and system-on-chip technologies, all of the technologies, licensed our AMD technologies. So there are no encumbrances from that standpoint.\\\\nWe have closed on the deal and we are starting execution of the deal. So we\\'ve talked about, from a financial standpoint, there is a $293 million licensing payment over a number of years. What we expect is the first payment we received in the first quarter of $50 million-ish, and we expect that over the first two years that about half of the licensing payments would be paid upon completion of some development milestones.\\\\nSo overall for us, I\\'ve talked about IP monetization in a very broad sense. For us, that includes patents as well as technology licensing. This one is very positive for us, not just from the standpoint that it leverages our IP, but it also gives us a very key partner in the Chinese market, which we all believe is going to be very, very important for data center growth going forward. So hopefully I addressed your questions there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, and if I may, just one quick follow-up. Are you of the view that you just can go and hit the ground running? I guess you do, because you are expecting a $50 million payment right away. But do you feel that -- is there any risk in the regulatory front on this deal? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We don\\'t expect any risk on the regulatory front. We believe that the technologies that we are licensing are compliant with all of the regulations -- the US regulatory issues. And I would also say that the joint venture is starting and we do believe that we will execute quickly.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          David Wong, Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Could you give us some idea? You called out your sequential growth guidance was in part due to graphics. Are you able to give us any feel for what sequential growth in graphics your guidance assumes?\\\\nAnd what products are driving the sequential growth? Does this come from Polaris? Or do Polaris revenues start after the June quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So David, our sequential guidance, as we mentioned, is due to both semi-custom and graphics. I would say it is more heavily weighted on semi-custom.\\\\nBut if you look at our graphics progression over the last couple of quarters, even though Q1 is normally a weaker market than Q4, we grew units overall in the desktop graphics business. So we believe that was on some of the strength of some of our new software work and our work with the ecosystem.\\\\nSo going into the second quarter, again, we believe that we have an opportunity in graphics to drive some volume. Polaris is on track to launch in the middle of the year and we will expect that will drive -- further strengthen the second half.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. And just a clarification. You mentioned $53 million license gain, but if I understand correctly, your guidance is for $25 million in the second quarter. Is that part of that $53 million? Or is that something different?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, and Treasurer    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          David, I can take that. So the total proceeds in the Q1 time frame are $57 million, but there are some taxes related to that. So the net cash [will result] $52 million. We recognized $7 million in Q1 of 2016. We are recognizing $25 million in Q2, and then the rest of it will be over the second half of 2016, which is the balance, $20 million.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great, thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hans Mosesmann, Raymond James.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. - Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Can you give us a sense on Zen, based on you\\'re hitting all your performance milestones, what part of the server market are you addressing? What\\'s the size of the opportunity? And I am assuming that you can go after both enterprise and data center because it is an x86.  Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. We are pleased with the progress on Zen. Obviously, there are lots of engineering milestones to pass, but a key one is that we are on track to sample to our priority customers in the second quarter.\\\\nIn terms of the markets that we can address, yes, we do believe that Zen has broad applicability across enterprise and data center. And we will continue to work with both OEMs and ODMs to ensure that they have the right boards and platforms for our products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. - Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how the JV is going to be set up over time. Will you compete with them with standard products within China, or is there some kind of dividing of the market? And will they be manufacturing the products through their own foundry relationships or will you be delivering them manufactured product?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, so the way to think about it is the JV roadmap will be a complementary roadmap to our own server roadmap, so we think there will be enough differentiation. But taken as a whole, it will be a compelling roadmap.\\\\nIn terms of foundries, I think we are not ready to talk about foundries. But we will update more about the products as we get further into the execution.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And will the monetization of this over time -- I mean, you mentioned that there is a royalty component as well. Will most of the monetization come from the licensing? Or do you think the royalty portion could be of similar size down the road?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I would say that it is probably a bit early to call that. The licensing payment is well understood. The royalties will come over time, depending on the strength of the products and the number of products that are being done.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Ian Ing, MKM Partners.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First question on the server JV. Your products are going to go up against [decent incumbency] in the China server market, so how advantaged do you think this JV will be in terms of perhaps being a locally sourced product? Are there other advantages that this JV would bring to the table to address the incumbency?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think we believe that there is a large opportunity in the data center market across the board. That is why we are investing so much in Zen and its follow ons. As it relates to the China JV that we are doing with THATIC, I think there is a -- certainly a benefit to having someone local that has experience in the market and knowledge of the market. And THATIC is an investment consortium that is partially led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\\\\nSo we think that both from a technical and a commercial standpoint, they will be a value-added partner in this joint venture.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks. And for my follow-up, for your June guidance, you are getting some strength in from this new semi-custom ramp. How sustained should we think that ramp to be? And is it a seasonal ramp? Does it come back every year? Any granularity would help. Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          As it relates to our guidance for the second quarter and then the full year, if you think about the semi-custom business in the last few years, the third quarter is always the peak. And it will be the peak this year as well. We are starting some of the ramp in the second quarter as we build up to the stronger third quarter.\\\\nBut overall, I think we feel good about the semi-custom business. The business overall will grow year on year as a result of the product momentum we have.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, thanks. I will re-queue.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Vivek Arya, Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nShankar Iyer,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. I have a question on the gross margins. Given the strong growth in Q2, why isn\\'t the gross margin growing? And longer term, what are the levers behind the gross margin? Can it grow from 32% to 35%, 40%, and what do you have to do get there?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, and Treasurer    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think if you look at the business in particular, as I said even in my prepared remarks, you have gross margin levers. But one of the things that obviously comes into play is the mix of business between the semi-custom business or the EESC business, and then the CG business. So that obviously comes in play, as Lisa said.\\\\nWe have the growth with our guidance for revenue in Q2, and it is weighted towards the semi-custom business in addition to the growth that we are seeing in graphics. And that is primarily what is driving the guidance at 31% as compared to where we came in in Q1 at the 32% level.\\\\nAnd then as far as the levels going on from there, I think it partly is a mix of the business overall from a viewpoint of the semi-custom business and other businesses. But also the continuing investment we are making in the roadmaps, as you see from our OpEx guidance for the rest of the year, as we want to go ahead and invest in products, in graphics, and other areas that will help us improve the gross margin. And then getting into later on when the Zen product is introduced, having even higher gross margin compared to where we are today.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nShankar Iyer,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it, thanks. As a follow-up on the semi-custom side, the -- didn\\'t some embedded revenue will likely come in in the second half? Like you guided before -- $1 billion of total revenue spread over, I think, three years. How much of the second-half growth in semi-custom comes from embedded versus semi-custom?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So maybe let me give you some explanation on that. So the semi-custom, if you -- just to recap on what we\\'ve said about the semi-custom designs in the past, we have a total of three design wins that have a lifetime revenue of about -- let\\'s call it $1.5 billion or greater. And that will come across over the next three to four years. In addition, we have our current game console business as well.\\\\nSo when you look at the aggregate of that, we do expect to start ramping that new business in the second half of the year. But we also expect the seasonal uplift of our traditional game console business. So that is adding to what we expect will be a strong year for semi-custom overall.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nShankar Iyer,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          If I can just slip in, the $1.5 billion you said, is that evenly split over the next three to four years or is it ramps towards the end of 2018 or so?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, it is definitely -- I mean, it takes some time to ramp. So this year will be lower since it is half a year and it is not all the designs. And as we go into the next few years, it will ramp to a steady-state.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nShankar Iyer,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking my questions. First, on the licensing agreement, can you be a little more specific on exactly what you are licensing? You said it was like high-performance CPUs and SoCs. Is this x86? Is it ARM? Is it both? What are the other pieces besides CPUs, potentially, that you are licensing?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The -- what we are licensing is microprocessor technology and system-on-chip technology. So they are technologies, not products. The technologies are applicable to both x86 and ARM. But as you know, most of our investments are in x86.\\\\nAnd then in terms of other aspects, there are other aspects that are needed to put together system-on-chip. So they include things like fabrics and other IP.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So let me ask the question a different way. Will the JV be able to manufacture and sell x86-based server chips into China?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. The JV will be able to manufacture and sell x86 server chips.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, thank you. I have one more question for you on IP. Is this JV exclusive? Or will you be free to sign other server-based JVs with other parties, both either inside China or outside of China?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It is not an exclusive deal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And one more, if I could. Just on your -- sorry, in your current quarter, you launched Bristol Ridge in March. So maybe that led to some of the incremental better-than-market-unit growth. But why were ASPs overall down, given the product refresh that started? And what do you expect for pricing into Q2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so, if you talk about the Bristol Ridge launch, we did start the launch in March, including -- on the mobile side. And that did contribute to some of the mobile units up. If you look at the overall ASPs, actually mobile ASPs were up. Desktop ASPs were down, and that is why we said overall down. But it was quite modest. So if you look overall, I think the ASP trends are about what we would expect.\\\\nGoing into the second quarter in general, it depends on the mix and the mix of the product. We are certainly trying to sell further up the stack. But we will have to see how the exact mix comes out. But there is not a dramatic change in ASPs, if that is what you\\'re asking.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Harlan Sur, JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBill Peterson,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Bill Peterson calling in for Harlan. Thanks for taking the question. A clarification on an earlier question. You said most of the growth is coming from semi-custom and some from graphics.\\\\nHow much -- is there any channel fill or related Polaris revenue in the second quarter or planned in the second quarter? Or is it really a second-half story?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Again, not being specific, because we have not actually announced our launch date, but I would say the majority of Polaris is a second-half story.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBill Peterson,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, thanks. And then more of a broader question related to PCs obviously becoming less important. But what is AMD\\'s view on the PC market in terms of unit shipments this year? And what is the expectation in terms of AMD\\'s growth in that segment if we think about the full year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So again, on the PC market, I think our view of the PC market is very consistent with what\\'s out there, probably down, let\\'s call it, high-single digits. Certainly the first quarter started off a bit weaker than any of us would have liked.\\\\nI would say, though, that in that environment, we still believe that we can gain share in both the client compute and the graphics side. Really, as we are transitioning to a new product portfolio on the graphics side, so I think that is a strong driver for us.\\\\nAnd then on the client compute side, between our product refresh and also our partnership with OEMs. I think in general, OEMs are getting more comfortable using us higher up in the stack, and our A8s, our A10s, our commercial-based processors. So we are continuing to work with OEMs to ensure that we get into the right priority platforms. So that would be our focus, even in a down market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBill Peterson,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Thanks for that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Suji Desilva, Topeka Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSuji Desilva,  Topeka Capital Markets - Analyst    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the arrangement with THATIC, can you talk about what end markets the server product would be specifically targeting? Is it going after government business there, research institutions, or maybe the China Internet companies?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think it\\'s fair to say that the market range for the joint venture will be across China, so across all of the markets that you mentioned.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSuji Desilva,  Topeka Capital Markets - Analyst    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Can you talk about the pipeline for the licensing business you instituted I guess -- announced a couple of quarters ago? You already have a success here. I\\'m wondering how robust the pipeline might be for further licensing opportunity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Look, we are thinking about our IP monetization strategy as really a broad strategy that is going to unfold over the next number of years. So I wouldn\\'t say that these things are all going to be immediate.\\\\nThe IP monetization includes patent licensing. It includes sales of certain parts of our patent portfolio that are no longer core to our business, as well as the strategic technology licensing.\\\\nWe have a good, solid pipeline. I would say it\\'s -- there are lots of opportunities out there. We are looking for ones that are very additive to our product portfolio and to our roadmap objectives. And I think we will look for the right partners to enable that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSuji Desilva,  Topeka Capital Markets - Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          One last quick question; would you be -- would it be possible to tell us how long you had been in discussions with this licensing agreement to understand how long lead times are for them to close?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It is fair to say that any one of these deals takes awhile. So they are fairly involved to go through. But I think we have a good set of conversations and we certainly believe that there is a lot of value in this IP portfolio that we will continue to leverage.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSuji Desilva,  Topeka Capital Markets - Analyst    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (inaudible) by all means. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Sidney Ho calling on behalf of Ross. Thanks for taking my question. So first question is you talked about EESC revenue will be up annually, and I think you talk about the different components.\\\\nJust to be clear, do you expect to game console revenue specifically to be up? And kind of related to that, do you expect the C&G revenue to be up this year as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Again, I would like to keep it at the segment level. And at the segment level, we expect both segments to be up -- to contribute to our overall guidance of revenue being up. As it relates to our EESC business, the majority of the EESC business is semi-custom, so semi-custom would have to be up year over year. And then I think that is about as specific as I would like to get.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. And my follow-up question is on the discrete GPU market. Your competitor has grown very nicely by, what, 35% in the last two years. Clearly, some of that is coming from share gains.\\\\nWhat do you think -- I mean, you guys have also gained share in Q1, seems like. What do you think the graphics market itself is growing on a normalized basis? And it wasn\\'t that long ago you guys were like 50% share in discrete graphics.\\\\nBut with the traction you are seeing right now and with Polaris right around the corner, how quickly do you think you can regain share? And which segment do you think has the biggest opportunities?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the graphics business is very strategic to us, and I think it is not just a unit story. It is really also the mix going to higher-end graphics, driven by VR and driven by AAA gaming, and all the things going on there.\\\\nAs it relates our share, I will say that we certainly have aspirations to regain shares to our historic levels. It will take us some period of time, so it will happen over multiple number of quarters. We are optimistic about the second half of the year and we think Polaris is positioned well. We are particularly positioning in some of the mainstream segments that are higher volume, so would drive share growth faster. And we will have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great, thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Christopher Danely, Citigroup.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nUnidentified Audience Member    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Marco speaking on behalf of Chris Danely. In light of your IP licensing agreement with THATIC, can you just kind of talk about your expectations for the China server market in 2016/2017? And if are there any longer-term milestones?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so with regard to our China JV with THATIC, we are -- we\\'re starting the development phase in 2016, so I would say that we view this as a longer-term opportunity for us. But overall, I think all of the trends in the data center market are certainly positive. We believe we can participant in those trends with both the AMD products as well as the JV products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nUnidentified Audience Member    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. And then my follow-up -- regarding your days of inventory, it looks like this quarter is about 110 days. Why is it so high? And if you -- if there\\'s any worries.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, and Treasurer    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think if you look at it from a days standpoint, essentially we have managed the inventory pretty well. It is up slightly in Q1, but we also guided the revenue up pretty significantly from where we ended in Q1. And we have also said the second half of the year, we are expecting strength over first half, and obviously that leads to higher inventory.\\\\nSo Q1 to Q2, up slightly; revenues up. And then we expect second half to be stronger than the first half.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nUnidentified Audience Member    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [73]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Kevin Cassidy, Stifel.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [74]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you for taking my question. On the licensing and JV, are there opportunities -- would you consider the mobile market or the desktop market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          When you say the -- you mean mobile PCs or mobile other?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, notebook -- just mobile PCs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [77]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I see. Look, I think as it relates to the overall licensing strategy, I think we are open to licensing that makes sense. And so strategically placed with the right market, with the right market drivers, I don\\'t think we have anything that is necessarily off-limits.\\\\nI will say that it does need to be strategic and additive to our product business. Our first priority is the product business, and the IP monetization efforts is an overlay on top of that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [78]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay? And what is the time frame for the JV? I guess does this license go on through the life of the patent?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [79]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It is for a number of years through the product development and sales cycle.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [80]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, nothing specific right now?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [81]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Nothing specific right now.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [82]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [83]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Vijay Rakesh, Mizuho Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA - Analyst    [84]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just on this licensing agreement, obviously when you license it to China, do you think they have the manufacturing or process experience to go into production with this? And what is the timeline to get commercial products in the market with this licensing agreement?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [85]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We are not talking about sort of the details of the product timelines just yet. We would like to really get the JV off and running before we disclose those details. And those will be disposed as part of the joint venture.\\\\nAs it relates to manufacturing, I think there might be interest in manufacturing in China, although that is certainly not a condition of the deal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA - Analyst    [86]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And as you look at this semi-custom ramp, the 15% to 18%, very encouraging. How do you split it up between gaming and the new VR strategy, VR market? Obviously, VR seems to be a huge market as you look out. Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [87]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I think the way to think about it is for the near term, I think the semi-custom business and gaming is probably the larger driver. We believe VR is a strategic area where you will see more pickup over the next number of quarters and over the next years. But it is not the near-term driver.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVijay Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA - Analyst    [88]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it, thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [89]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          John Pitzer, Credit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [90]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I guess my first question -- when you look at your full-year guide for revenue to grow, I am kind of curious to what extent is that based upon sort of market forecast versus market share gains.\\\\nI know you don\\'t want to get into division by division, but maybe at a high level, as you look at your year-over-year growth, how do you differentiate between what the market is doing and kind of the market share gains that you need to get to that year-over-year growth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [91]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, that is a fair question. So let me break it up into the two segments. When you look at the EESC segment and especially semi-custom, that is less about a general market and more about what we see in terms of the customer forecasts, and what they are seeing the market to be. So I think those are, let\\'s call it, fairly well understood by us, and we are very interlocked with our customers.\\\\nWhen you talk about the computing and graphics market, I think that is where you get a little bit more of how much uncertainty is there with the PC market trends. There is no question that the PC market is weaker than any of us would like.\\\\nI think from our standpoint, though, if you remember the last few quarters and how many times we\\'ve talked about inventory normalization and ensuring that we got ourselves into a healthy position relative to our OEM and channel customers, I think we feel that we\\'ve done a good job there. And we are now in a place where the consumption is more in line with the selling.\\\\nSo we believe that even in this market, there is enough opportunity for us to gain share, and obviously we have to prove that out over the next couple of quarters. But just given where our business is, where we see the products, and where we see the design wins, that is how we see the market right now.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [92]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then Lisa, I apologize if you addressed this, but just going back to the JV in China, I am just kind of curious. The IP licensing gains you expected this year, are there any milestones that you need to hit to get that? And as we think about 2017, if you hit the milestones in 2017, would we expect licensing to grow year over year from the JV?\\\\nAnd then lastly on the JV, just given that you guys have the opportunity to go into China today and sell your own product, I am just curious how we should think about $100 of server product in the JV and what that means to you from an economic standpoint versus you just going into China today and selling $100 worth of server product as AMD.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [93]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, no, good question. So look, on the JV licensing payments, we will expect about half of the licensing revenue to come over the next two years, so over 2016 and 2017. Our current forecast for 2016 was that $50-ish million that Devinder mentioned, and it is contingent on several milestones that we believe are on track.\\\\nTo your broader question about why do a JV versus just selling right into servers? We are very cognizant of where our share is in servers. So I believe we have the technology to get there and we will continue to make progress.\\\\nBut given the importance of China and the fact that having a partner who is very much familiar with both the Chinese market from a customer as well as just a technology standpoint I think can only be additive. And there is more than enough server market to go after, given where we are. So I think it\\'s an additive deal to our baseline strategy.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [94]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [95]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Deepon Nag, Macquarie.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDeepon Nag,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [96]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, for the semi-custom wins that you are going to get in the back half of the year, are those going to be purely incremental to existing products? Or is there any risk of cannibalization to existing products?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [97]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I don\\'t believe that we have gone through any detail about what those wins are, so I would prefer to let that come out as our customers are ready to launch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDeepon Nag,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [98]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, thanks for that. And then on the game console side, so clearly VR is going to be a pretty big deal in Q4 with so many PS4 VR. And there has been some chatter about obviously maybe a thatcher refresh for some of the game consuls.\\\\nBecause the value of graphics is becoming higher in these game consoles, is there any potential for you to get higher content, and more specifically higher margins in future console refreshes? And is there also any ability to renegotiate terms if -- because of the value of your IP is getting more valuable inside these consoles?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [99]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let me take that in several pieces. Relative to our current game consoles, those deals were well negotiated at the beginning, and I don\\'t think we will be renegotiating. I think the ASPs and all that stuff are also well understood.\\\\nRelative to what VR brings -- and again, not being specific to any particular customer because there is just a lot of speculation out there in the industry -- I will say that VR is very exciting, not just for game consoles, but for PC gaming, for the headset guys, for the ecosystem. So yes, we believe that graphics becomes much more valuable in this framework, and we will be looking for how to leverage and monetize that across both our semi-custom business as well as our discrete graphics and APU businesses.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDeepon Nag,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [100]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just one quick clarification, if I could squeeze it in. So if -- for any future console refreshes, though, you do have the ability to reset ASP trends? Or is it already pre-negotiated in your initial contracts?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [101]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think if anybody were to do a different console or a new console, then that would be a new negotiation. But for the current generation consoles, those terms are locked.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDeepon Nag,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [102]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [103]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jaguar Bajwa, Arete Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [104]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking the question. Just on the Polaris launch in midyear, you talked about attacking the mainstream segment of the GPU market. I just wonder when you look at potential share gains in the second half, do you expect that to come more from the discrete desktop side in the AIB channel or the notebook space where you have a relatively higher share, market share?\\\\nAnd given your ASPs in that space, roughly in the discrete desktop spaces, I think you\\'ve got about a third of the ASP of your competitor. Just wondering on the trend of that and how you see that over the second half of the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [105]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so we believe that we have a share gain opportunity in both mobile and desktop/AIB as we look at Polaris and how it will launch in the second half of the year. Relative to the ASP trends, I think that depends a bit on the mix of the business. So I think I will defer that to how things look.\\\\nBut from a macro standpoint, we believe we can get a larger share -- a larger revenue share in discrete graphics. But we will certainly have to look at how the individual quarters shape up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [106]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then also, on the -- given your IP licensing deal in China, I am just wondering on the acceleration side for GPU, do you see opportunity there potentially with that deal?\\\\nAnd also just in a more general sense, we hear a lot about acceleration with GPU. Can you just talk about how you\\'re approaching that acceleration in general? Will Polaris be suited to that? Or will we have to wait for Vega to come out later in the year? And how do you differentiate versus your competitors?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [107]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          In terms of your first question on GPU acceleration, so the JV that we announced with THATIC is focused on microprocessor technologies only, so it does not cover graphics.\\\\nAnd then to your comment about graphics acceleration or just in general becoming more important and a growth driver, we would agree with that. I think going forward, you will see a bit more focus from us in that area. We have launched some new professional graphics products recently.\\\\nWe will -- we\\'ve also introduced this new software initiative called GPUOpen that really focuses on building an open ecosystem around the graphics area, both in compute and gaming. So we do believe it is a good opportunity and it\\'ll be an area that we will invest more.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [108]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great, thanks very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  AMD - SVP Human Resources, Corporate Communications, and IR    [109]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Operator, that concludes today\\'s call.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Simona. We had an outstanding quarter and fiscal 2018 led by strong growth in our gaming and data center businesses. Q4 revenue reached $2.91 billion, up 34% year-on-year, up 10% sequentially, and above our outlook of $2.65 billion. All measures of profitability set records. They also hit important milestones. For the first time, gross margins strongly exceeded 60%, non-GAAP operating margins exceeded 40% and net income exceeded $1 billion.\\\\nFiscal 2018 revenue was $9.71 billion, up 41% or $2.8 billion above the previous year. Each of our platforms posted record full year revenue, with data center growing triple digits. From a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 33% from last year to $2.46 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 75% to $450 million.\\\\nLet\\'s start with our gaming business. Q4 revenue was $1.74 billion, up 29% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially with growth across all regions. Driving GPU demand were a number of great titles during the holiday season, including Player\\'s Battleground (sic) [PlayerUnknown\\'s Battlegrounds], PUBG, Destiny 2, Call of Duty: WWII, Star Wars Battlefront II.\\\\nPUBG continued its remarkable run, reaching almost 30 million players and recording more than 3 million concurrent players. These games deliver stunning visual effects that require strong graphics performance which has driven a shift toward the higher end of our gaming portfolio and adoption of our Pascal architecture.\\\\neSports continues to grow, expanding the overall industry and our business. In one sign of their popularity, Activision\\'s Overwatch League launched in January and reached 10 million viewers globally in its first week.\\\\nWe had a busy start to the year with a number of announcements at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We introduced NVIDIA BFGDs, big-format gaming displays, in a partnership with Acer, ASUS and HP. These high-end 65-inch 4K displays enable ultralow latency gaming and integrate our SHIELD streaming device, offering popular apps such as Netflix, gaming video (sic) [Amazon Video], YouTube and Hulu. The BFGD won 9 Best of Show awards for various publications.\\\\nWe expanded the free beta of GeForce NOW beyond Macs to Window-based PCs, and we enhanced GeForce Experience with new features, including NVIDIA freestyle for customizing gameplay with various filters. And updated NVIDIA Ansel\\'s photo mode and support for new titles with ShadowPlay highlights for capturing gaming achievements. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch gaming console contributed to our growth as it became the fastest-selling console of all time in the U.S.\\\\nStrong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations. We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business, and some was met with our gaming GPUs. This contributed to lower than historical channel inventory levels of our gaming GPUs throughout the quarter. While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter. That said, our main focus remains on our core gaming market as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile.\\\\nMoving to data center. Revenue of $606 million was up 105% year-on-year and up 20% sequentially. This excellent performance reflected strong adoption of Tesla V100 GPUs based on our Volta architecture which began shipping in Q2 and continued to ramp in Q3 and Q4. V100s are available through every major computer maker and have been chosen by every major cloud provider to deliver AI and high-performance computing. Hyperscale and cloud customers adopting the V100 include Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, Baidu, Google, IBM, Microsoft Azure, Oracle and Tencent.\\\\nWe continued our leadership in AI-trending markets where our GPUs remain the platform of choice for training deep learning networks. During the quarter, Japan\\'s Preferred Networks trained the ResNet-50 neural network for image classification in a record 15 minutes by using 1,024 Tesla P100 GPUs. Our newer-generation V100s delivered even higher performance, with the Volta architecture offering 10x the deep learning performance of Pascal.\\\\nWe also saw a growing traction in the AI inference market where NVIDIA\\'s platform can improve performance and efficiency by orders of magnitude over CPUs. We continue to view AI inference as a significant new opportunity for our data center GPUs. Hyperscale inference applications that run on GPUs include speech recognition, image and video analytics, recommender systems, translation, search and natural language processing.\\\\nThe data center business also benefited from strong growth in high-performance computing. The HPC community has increasingly moved to accelerated computing in recent years as Moore\\'s Law has begun to level off. Indeed, more than 500 HPC applications are now GPU-accelerated, including all of the top 15. NVIDIA added a record 34 new GPU-accelerated systems to the latest TOP500 supercomputer list, bringing our total to 87 systems. We increased our total petaflops of list by 28%, and we captured 14 of the top 20 spots on the Green500 list of the world\\'s most energy-efficient supercomputers.\\\\nDuring the quarter, we continued to support the buildout of major next-generation supercomputers. Among them is the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s Summit system, expected to be the world\\'s most powerful supercomputer when it comes online later this year. We also announced new wins such as Japan\\'s fastest AI supercomputer, the ABCI system, which leverages more than 4,000 Tesla V100 GPUs.\\\\nImportantly, we are starting to see the convergence of HPC and AI as scientists embrace AI to solve problems faster. Modern supercomputers will need to support multi-precision computation for applying deep learning together with simulation and testing. By combining AI with HPC, supercomputers can deliver increased performance that is orders of magnitudes greater in computations ranging from particle physics to drug discovery to astrophysics.\\\\nWe are also seeing traction for AI in a growing number of vertical industries, such as transportation, energy, manufacturing, smart cities and health care. We announced engagements with GE Health and Nuance in medical imaging; Baker Hughes, a GE company, in oil and gas; and Japan\\'s Komatsu in construction and mining.\\\\nMoving to professional visualization. Fourth quarter revenue grew a record -- to a record $254 million, up 13% from a year ago, up 6% sequentially, driven by demand for real-time rendering as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 30% of pro visualization sales. We saw strength across several key industries including defense, manufacturing, energy, health care and Internet service providers. Among key customers, high-end Quadro products are being used by GlaxoSmithKline for AI and by Pemex oil and gas for seismic processing and visualization.\\\\nTurning to automotive. In automotive, for the fourth quarter, revenue grew 3% year-on-year to $132 million and was down 8% sequentially. The sequential decline reflects our transition from infotainment, which is becoming commoditized, to next-generation AI cockpit systems and complete top-to-bottom self-driving vehicle platforms built on NVIDIA hardware and software.\\\\nAt CES, we demonstrated our leadership position on autonomous vehicles with several key milestones and new partnerships that point to AI self-driving cars moving from deployment to production. In a standing-room only keynote that drew nearly 8,000 attendees, Jensen announced that DRIVE Xavier, the world\\'s first autonomous machine processor, will be available to customers this quarter.\\\\nWith more than 9 billion transistors, DRIVE Xavier is the most complex system on a chip ever created. We also announced that NVIDIA DRIVE is the world\\'s first functionally safe AI self-driving platform, enabling automakers to create autonomous vehicles that can operate safely, a necessary ingredient for going to market.\\\\nAdditionally, we announced a number of collaborations at CES, including with Uber, which has been using NVIDIA technology for the AI computing system in its fleets of self-driving cars and freight trucks. We announced that ZF and Baidu are using NVIDIA DRIVE self-driving technologies to create a production-ready AI autonomous vehicle platform for China, the world\\'s largest automotive market. Production vehicles utilizing this technology, including those from Chery, are expected on the road by 2020.\\\\nWe also announced a partnership with Aurora, which is working to create a modular, scalable, Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving hardware platform, incorporating the NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier processor. Jensen was joined on stage by Volkswagen CEO, Herbert Diess. They announced the new generation of intelligent VW vehicles will use the NVIDIA DRIVE intelligent experience, or DRIVE IX, platform to create the new AI-infused cockpit experiences and improved safety.\\\\nLater at CES, Mercedes Benz announced that MBUX, its new AI-based smart cockpit uses NVIDIA\\'s graphics and AI technologies. The MBUX user experience, which includes beautiful touchscreen displays and a new voice-activated assistant, debuted last week at Mercedes-Benz A-Class compact car and will ship this spring. And earlier this week, we announced a partnership with Continental to build AI self-driving vehicle systems from enhanced Level 2 to Level 5 for production in 2021.\\\\nThere are now more than 320 companies and research institutions using the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. That\\'s up 50% from a year ago and encompasses virtually every carmaker, truck maker, robotaxi company, mapping company, sensor manufacturer and software startup in the autonomous vehicle ecosystem. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the intermediate to long-term opportunities for autonomous driving.\\\\nNow turning to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 61.9%, and non-GAAP was 62.1%, records that reflect continued growth in our value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $728 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $607 million, up 28% and 22% year-on-year, respectively. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, AI and automotive.\\\\nGAAP EPS was $1.78, up 80% from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a lower-than-expected tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.7% compared with our expectation of a tax rate of 17.5%.\\\\nNon-GAAP EPS was $1.72, up 52% from a year ago, reflecting a quarterly tax rate of 10.5% compared with our expectation of 17.5%. We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\\\\nOur quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels at $1.36 billion, bringing our fiscal year total to a record $3.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $416 million for the fourth quarter, inclusive of $335 million associated with the purchase of our previously financed Santa Clara campus building.\\\\nLet me take a moment to provide a bit more detail on the impact of U.S. corporate tax reform on the quarter and our go-forward financials. In Q4, we recorded a GAAP-only one-time net tax benefit of $133 million or $0.21 per diluted share. This is primarily related to provisional tax amounts for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We previously accrued for taxes on a portion of forward earnings in excess of the provisional tax amount recorded for the transition tax, hence, the one-time benefit.\\\\nFor fiscal 2019, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be around 12%, which is down from approximately 17% previously. This does not take into effect the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation which, depending on stock price and vesting schedule, could increase or decrease our tax rate and GAAP in a given quarter.\\\\nIn terms of our capital allocation priorities, we continue to focus first and foremost on investing in our business as we see significant opportunities ahead. Our lower tax rate strengthens our ability to invest in both OpEx, such as adding engineering talent; as well as CapEx, such as investing in supercomputers for internal AI development. In addition, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, with our plan remaining at $1.25 billion for fiscal 2019.\\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.7% and 63%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $770 million and $645 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 12%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items.\\\\nFor the full fiscal year 2019, we expect our operating expenses to grow at a similar pace as in Q1. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available in our IR website.\\\\nIn closing, I\\'d like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community. We\\'ll be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference on February 13 and at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on February 26. We will also be hosting our annual Investor Day on March 27 in San Jose, on the sidelines of our annual GPU Technology Conference, which we are very excited about.\\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you poll for questions, please?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess first question, when I think about normal seasonality for gaming, that would imply data center potentially north of $700 million-plus into the coming quarter. And so curious if I\\'m thinking about that right or whether crypto is being modeled more conservatively by you guys, and so would love to hear your thoughts there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Which way is more conservatively, C.J.?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes? Sorry.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          When you say conservatively, which direction were you saying it was. Are you implying up or down?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, just curious to hear your thoughts there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We model crypto approximately flat.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then I guess as part of a larger question, how are you thinking about seasonality for gaming into the ensuing quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, there\\'s a lot of dynamics going on in gaming. One dynamic, of course, is that there\\'s a fairly sizable pent-up demand going into this quarter. But I think the larger dynamics that are happening relate to just the really amazing games that are out right now.\\\\nPUBG is just -- is doing incredibly well, as you might have known, and it\\'s become a global phenomenon. And whether it\\'s here in the United States or in Europe, or in China, in Asia, PUBG is just doing incredibly well. And we expect other developers to come up with similar genre, like PUBG, that are going to be coming out in the near future. And I\\'m super excited about these games.\\\\nAnd then, of course, there\\'s Call of Duty, there\\'s Star Wars. There\\'s just so many great games that are out in the marketplace today, Overwatch and League of Legends, still doing well. There\\'s just a countless number of great franchises that are out in the marketplace. And the gaming market is growing, and production value is going up. And that\\'s driving increased unit sales of GPUs as well as ASPs of GPUs. And so I think those are -- that\\'s probably the larger dynamic of gaming.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The first question, the checks we\\'ve done indicate that the Tensor Cores you put into Volta give it a huge advantage in neural network applications in the data center. And I\\'m wondering whether the Tensor Cores might also have a similar kind of utility in the gaming market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, first of all, I appreciate you asking a Tensor Core question. It is probably the single biggest innovation we had last year in data centers.\\\\nOur GPUs, the equivalent performance to one of our GPUs -- one of our Volta GPUs would take something along the lines of 20-plus CPUs or 10-plus nodes. And so 1 GPU alone would do deep learning so fast that it would take 10-plus CPU-powered server nodes to keep up with.\\\\nAnd then Tensor Core comes along last year, and we increased the throughput of deep learning, increased the computational throughput of deep learning by another factor of 8. And so Tensor Core really illustrates the power of GPUs. It\\'s very unlike a CPU where the instruction set remains locked for a long time, and it\\'s hard -- it\\'s difficult to advance.\\\\nIn the case of our GPUs and with CUDA, that\\'s one of its fundamental advantages, we can continue to -- year in and year out, continue to add new capabilities to it. And so Tensor Core\\'s boost of the original great performance of our GPU has really raised the bar last year.\\\\nAnd as Colette said earlier, our Volta GPU has now been adopted all over the world, whether it\\'s in China with Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, iFLYTEK, to here in the United States, Amazon and Facebook and Google and Microsoft and IBM and Oracle in Europe, in Japan. The number of cloud service providers that have adopted Volta has been terrific, and I think everybody really appreciates the work that we did with Tensor Core.\\\\nAnd all of the updates that are now coming out from the frameworks, Tensor Core is a new instruction set, it\\'s a new architecture. And the deep learning developers have really jumped on it. And almost every deep learning framework is being optimized to take advantage of Tensor Core.\\\\nAnd on the inference side, and that\\'s where it would play a role in video games, you could use deep learning now to synthesize and to generate new art. And we\\'ve been demonstrating some of that at GTC, if you\\'ve seen some of that. Whether it\\'s improve the quality of textures, generating artificial characters, animating characters, whether it\\'s facial animation with -- for speech or body animation, the type of work that you can do with deep learning for video games is growing. And that\\'s where Tensor Core could be a real advantage.\\\\nIf you take a look at the computational capability that we have in Tensor Core, compare that to a nonoptimized GPU or even a CPU, it\\'s now 2-plus orders of magnitude greater computational throughput. And that allows us to do things like synthesize images in real time, synthesize virtual worlds, animate characters, animate faces, bring a new level of virtual reality and artificial intelligence to these video games.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the strong growth and the consistent execution. Jensen, just a near- and longer-term question on the data center. Near term, you had, had a number of strong quarters in data center. How is the utilization of these GPUs? And how do you measure whether you\\'re over or under from a supply perspective?\\\\nAnd then longer term, there seems to be a lot of money going into startups developing silicon for deep learning. Is there any advantage they have in taking a clean-sheet approach? Or is GPU the most optimal answer? Like if you were starting a new company looking at AI today, would you make another GPU? Or would you make another ASIC or some other format? Just any color would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. In the near term, the best way to measure customers that are already using our GPUs for deep learning is repeat customers. When they come back another quarter, another quarter, and they continue to buy GPUs, that would suggest that their workload has continued to increase.\\\\nThe -- with existing customers that already have a very deep penetration, another opportunity for us would be using our GPUs for inference, and that\\'s an untapped growth opportunity for our company that\\'s really, really exciting, and we\\'re seeing traction there.\\\\nFor companies that are not at the forefront, the absolute forefront, of deep learning, which -- with the exception of 1 or 2 or 3 hyperscalers, almost everybody else I would put in this category, and their deployment, their adoption of deep learning applying deep learning to all of their applications is still ongoing. And so I think the second wave of customers is just showing up.\\\\nAnd then there\\'s the third wave of customers which is -- they\\'re not hyperscalers, they -- they\\'re Internet service applications, Internet applications for consumers. They have enormous customer bases and -- that they could apply artificial intelligence to. But they run their application in hyperscale clouds. That third phase of growth is now really spiking, and I\\'m excited about that.\\\\nAnd so that\\'s kind of the way to think about it. There\\'s the pioneers, the first phase, are the returning customers. Then there\\'s the second phase that\\'s now ramping. The third phase that\\'s now ramping. And then for everybody, we have an opportunity to apply our GPUs for inference.\\\\nIf I had all the money in the world and I had, for example, billions and billions of dollars of R&D, I would give it to NVIDIA\\'s GPU team, which is exactly what I do. And the reason for that is because the GPU was already inherently the world\\'s best high-throughput computational processor.\\\\nA high-throughput processor is a lot more complicated than linear algebra done that you instantiate from a synopsis tool, it\\'s not quite that easy. The computation throughput, keeping everything moving through your chip with supreme levels of energy efficiency with all of the software that\\'s needed to keep the data flowing, with all of the optimizations that you do with each and every one of the frameworks, the amount of complexity there is just really enormous.\\\\nThe networks are changing all the time. It started out with just basically CNNs, and then all kinds of versions of CNNs now. It started out with RNNs and simple RNNs, and now there\\'s all kinds of LSTMs and gated RNNs, and all kinds of interesting networks that are growing. It started out with just 8 layers, and now it\\'s 152 layers going to 1,000 layers. It started with mostly recognition, and now it\\'s moving to synthesis with GANs. And there\\'s so many versions of GANs.\\\\nAnd so all of these different types of networks are really, really hard to nail down. And we\\'re still at the beginning of AI. So the ability for our GPUs to be programmable to all of these different architectures and networks is just an enormous advantage. You don\\'t ever have to guess whether NVIDIA GPUs could be used for one particular network or another. And so you could buy our GPUs at will and know that every single GPU that you buy gives you an opportunity to reduce the number of servers in your data center by 22 nodes, by 10 nodes, 22 CPUs. And so the more GPUs you buy, the more money you save.\\\\nAnd so I think that capability is really quite unique. And then if I could just give you one example from last year or from previous year, we introduced 16-bit mix precision, we introduced 8-bit integer, we introduced NVLink the year before this last year. This year -- this last year, we introduced Tensor Core, which increased it by another factor of nearly 10. Meanwhile, our GPUs get more complex, energy-efficient. Efficiency gets better and better every single year, and the software richness gets more amazing.\\\\nAnd so it\\'s a much harder problem than just a multiply accumulator. Artificial intelligence is the single most complex mode of software that the world has ever known. That\\'s the reason why it\\'s taken us so long to get here. And these high-performance supercomputers is an essential ingredient and an essential instrument in advancing AI. And so I don\\'t think it\\'s nearly as simple as linear algebra. But if I had all the money in the world, I would invest it in the team that we have.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have a question for Colette. So if I correct for the Switch revenue growth in the quarter, it means the gaming business [x], which was up, I don\\'t know maybe $140 million, $150 million. In your Q3 commentary, you did not call out crypto as a driver, you are calling it out in Q4. Is it fair to say that like that incremental growth is all crypto?\\\\nAnd I guess going forward, you mentioned pent-up demand. Normally, your seasonality for gaming will be down probably double digits. Do you think that pent-up demand is enough to reverse that normal seasonal pattern -- or normally down? And frankly, do you think gamers can even find GPUs at retail at this point to buy in order to satisfy that pent-up demand?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So let me comment on the first one. We did talk about our overall crypto business last quarter as well. We indicated how much we had in OEM boards, and we also indicated that there was definitely some also in our GTX business.\\\\nKeep in mind, that\\'s very difficult for us to quantify down to the end customer. It is. But yes, there is also some in our Q3, and we did comment on it. So here we are commenting in terms of what we saw in terms of Q4. It\\'s up a bit from what we saw in Q3, and we do again expect probably going forward. I\\'ll let Jensen answer regarding the demand for gamers as we move forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So if you -- one way to think about the pent-up demand is we typically have somewhere between 6 to 8 weeks of inventory in the channel. And I think you would ascertain that globally right now the channel is relatively lean.\\\\nWe\\'re working really hard to get GPUs down to the marketplace for the gamers, and we\\'re doing everything we can to advise Etailers and system builders to serve the gamers. And so we\\'re doing everything we can. But I think the most important thing is we just got to catch up with supply.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I actually want to circle back on the autos, since I was at CES. So it\\'s still kind of on track for calendar -- towards calendar year \\'19, at the end of that, where we see the autonomous kind of ASP uplift. And just to clarify, the expected ASP uplift is somewhere around $1,000. Is that about right?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, it just depends on mix. I think the -- for autonomous vehicles that still have drivers, passenger cars, branded cars, ASPs anywhere from $500 to $1,000 make sense. For robot taxis, where they\\'re driverless, they\\'re not autonomous vehicles, they\\'re actually driverless vehicles, the ASP will be several thousand dollars.\\\\nAnd in terms of timing, I think that you\\'re going to see larger and larger deployments starting this year and going through next year for sure, especially with robot taxis. And then with autonomous vehicles, cars that have autonomous driving capability, automatic driving capability starts late 2019. You could see a lot more in 2020. And just almost every premium car by 2022 will have autonomous automatic driving capabilities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Jensen, I was hoping to ask a little bit about inferencing. How big was inferencing within data center in Q4 or fiscal \\'18? And more importantly, how do you expect it to trend over the next 12 to 18 months?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks a lot, Toshi. First of all, just a comment about inference. The way that it works is you take the output of these frameworks. And the output of these frameworks is a really complex, large computational graph.\\\\nWhen you think about these neural networks, and they have millions of parameters, millions of anything is very complex. And these parameters are waves and activation layers and -- activation functions, and there are millions of them. And it\\'s millions of them that composes -- consists of this computational graph. And this computational graph has all kinds of interesting and complicated layers.\\\\nAnd so you take this computational graph that comes out of each one of these frameworks, and they\\'re all different. They\\'re in different formats, they\\'re in different styles, they have different architectures. They\\'re all different. And you take these computational graphs, and you have to find a way to compile it, to optimize this graph, to rationalize all of the things that you could combine and fold, reduce the amount of conflict across all of the resources that are in your GPUs -- or in your processor.\\\\nAnd these conflicts could be on-chip memory and register files and data paths, and it could be the fabric, it could be the frame buffer interface, it could be the amount of memory. I mean you got -- this computer is really complicated across all these different processors and the interconnect between GPUs, the network that connects multiple nodes. And so you\\'ve got to figure out what all these different conflicts are, resources are, and compile and optimize to take advantage of it to keep it moving all the time.\\\\nAnd so TensorRT is basically a very sophisticated optimizing graph compilation -- graph compiler. And it targets each one of our processors. The way it targets Xavier is different to the way it targets Volta, the way it targets our inference, the way it targets for low energy, for different precisions. All of that targeting is different. And so first of all, TensorRT, the software of inference, that\\'s really where the magic is.\\\\nThen the second thing that we do, we optimize our GPUs for extremely high throughput and to support different precisions because some networks could afford to have 8-bit integer or even less, some really could barely get by with a 16-bit floating point and some, you really would like to keep it at 32-bit floating point so that you don\\'t have to second-guess about any precision that you lost along the way. And so we created an architecture that consists of this optimizing graph, computational graph compiler, to processors that are very high throughput, that are mix precision. Okay, so that\\'s kind of the background.\\\\nWe start -- we\\'ve been sampling our Tesla P4, which is our data center inference processor, and I -- we\\'re seeing just really exciting response. And this quarter, we started shipping. We -- looking outwards, my sense is that the inference market is probably about as large in the data centers as training. And the wonderful thing is everything that you train on our processor will inference wonderfully on our processors as well.\\\\nAnd the data centers are really awakening to the observation that the more GPUs they buy for offloading inference and training, the more money they save. And the amount of money they save is not 20% or 50%, it\\'s factors of 10. The money savings for all of these data centers that are becoming increasingly capital constrained is really quite dramatic.\\\\nAnd then the other inference opportunity for us is autonomous machines, which is self-driving cars. TensorRT also targets Xavier. TensorRT targets our Pegasus robot taxi computer. And they all have to inference incredibly efficiently so that we can sustain real time, keep the energy level low and keep the cost low for car companies, okay? So I think inference is a very important work for us. It is very complicated work, and we\\'re making great progress.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just kind of curious, as you look at the Gaming business -- I\\'ve kind of lost track of what seasonality is. You clearly have a big ramp ahead of you. I\\'m kind of curious, as you think about Pascal versus seasonality ahead of Volta, if you can just kind of extrapolate as you look out into April and maybe July.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I -- well, we haven\\'t announced anything for April or July. And so the best way to think about that is Pascal is the best gaming platform on the planet. It is the most feature-rich, the best software, the most energy-efficient. And from $99 to $1,000, you could buy the world\\'s best GPUs, the most advanced GPUs. And if you buy Pascal, you know you\\'ve got the best.\\\\nSeasonality is a good question and increasingly because gaming is a global market and because people play games every day. It\\'s just part of their life. There\\'s no -- I don\\'t think there\\'s much seasonality in TV or books or music. People just -- whenever new titles come out, that\\'s when a new season starts.\\\\nAnd so in China, there\\'s iCafes and there\\'s Singles\\' Day, November 11, there\\'s Back to School in the United States, there\\'s Christmas, there\\'s Chinese New Year. Boy, there are so many seasons that it\\'s kind of hard to imagine what the exact seasonality is anymore. And so hopefully, over time, it becomes less of a matter. But the most important thing is that we expect Pascal to continue to be the world\\'s best gaming platform for the foreseeable future.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the solid results and the execution. I know somebody asked a question about inferencing for the data center markets. But on inferencing for embedded and Edge applications, on the software and firmware side, you talked about TensorRT framework; on the hardware side, you\\'ve got the Jetson TX platform; for embedded and Edge inferencing applications, things like drones and factory automation and transportation. What else is the team doing in the embedded market to capture more of the TAM opportunity there going forward?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks a lot, Harlan. The NVIDIA TensorRT is really the only optimizing inference compiler in the world today, and it targets all of our platforms. And we do inference in the data center that I mentioned earlier. In the embedded world, the first embedded platform we\\'re targeting is self-driving cars.\\\\nIn order to drive the car, you basically inference or try to predict or perceive what\\'s around you all the time. And that\\'s a very complicated inference matter. It could be extremely easy, like detecting the car in front of you and applying the brakes, or it could be incredibly hard which is trying to figure out whether you should stop at an intersection or not.\\\\nIf you look at most intersections, you can\\'t just look at the lights to determine where do you stop. There are very few lines. And so using scene understanding and using deep learning, we have the ability to recognize where to stop and whether to stop.\\\\nAnd then for Jetson, we have a platform called Metropolis. And Metropolis is used for very large scale smart cities where cameras are deployed all over to keep cities safe. And we\\'ve been very successful with smart cities. Just about every major smart city provider, and what is called intelligent video analysis company, whether -- almost all over the world is using NVIDIA\\'s platform to do inference at the Edge, AI at the Edge.\\\\nAnd then we\\'ve announced recently success with FANUC, the largest manufacturing and robotics company in the world; Komatsu, one of the largest construction equipments company in the world to apply AI at the Edge for autonomous machines. Drones, we have several industrial drones that are inspecting pipelines and inspecting power lines, flying over large spans of farms to figure out where to spray insecticides more accurately. There\\'s all kinds of applications.\\\\nSo you\\'re absolutely right that inference at the Edge or AI at the Edge is a very large market opportunity for us, and that\\'s exactly why TensorRT was created.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You had mentioned how lean the channel is in terms of gaming cards. There\\'s been an observable increase in prices at retail. And I\\'m just curious, is that a broad-based phenomenon? And is there any economic ramifications to you? Or is that just sort of retailers bringing prices up in a shortage environment?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We don\\'t set prices at the end of the market. And the best way for us to solve this problem is work on demand -- excuse me, work on supply. The demand is great. And it\\'s very likely the demand will remain great as we look throughout -- through this quarter.\\\\nAnd so we just have to keep working on increasing supply. We have -- our suppliers are the world\\'s best and the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, and they\\'re responding incredibly, and I\\'m really grateful for everything they\\'re doing. We just got to catch up to that demand which is just really great.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland with Susquehanna.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great quarter. So just to clarify, Jensen, on pent-up demand. One of your GPU competitors basically said that the constraint was memory. I just want to make sure that, that was correct.\\\\nAnd then in the CFO commentary, you mentioned opportunities for professional vis, like AI and deep learning. Can you talk about that, and what kind of applications you would use, Quadro versus Volta or GeForce?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. We are -- we\\'re just constrained. Obviously, we\\'re 10x larger of a GPU supplier than the competition. And so we have a lot more suppliers supporting us and a lot more distributors taking our products to market and a lot more partners distributing our products all over the world. And so we -- I don\\'t know how to explain it aside from the demand is just really great. And so we\\'ve just got to keep our nose to it and catch up to the demand.\\\\nWith respect to Quadro, Quadro is a workstation processor. The entire software stack is designed for all of the applications that the workstation industry uses. And it\\'s used -- the quality of the rendering is, of course, world-class because of NVIDIA and -- but the entire software stack has been designed so that mission-critical applications or long-life industrial applications and companies that are enormous and gigantic manufacturing and industrial companies in the world could rely on an entire platform which consists of processors and system and software and middleware and all the integrations into all of the CAD tools in the world to know that the supplier is going to be here and can be trusted for the entire life of the use of that product which could be several years, but the data that is generated from it has to be accountable for a couple of decades.\\\\nYou need to be able to pull up an entire design of a plane or a train or a car a couple decades after it was sent to production to make sure that it\\'s still in compliance, and if there are any questions about it, that it can be pulled up. NVIDIA\\'s entire platform was designed to be professional class, professional grade, long lived.\\\\nNow the thing that\\'s really exciting about artificial intelligence is we now can use AI to improve images. Like, for example, you could fix a photograph using AI. You could fill in damaged parts of a photograph or parts of the image that hasn\\'t been rendered yet, you want to use AI to fill in the dots, predict the future, rendering results, which we announced and which we demonstrated at GTC recently.\\\\nYou could use that to generate designs. You sketch up a few strokes of what you want a car to look like. And based on the inventory, safety, physics, it could -- it has learned how to fill in the rest of it, okay, design the rest of the chassis on your behalf. It\\'s called generative design. We\\'re going to see generative design in product design, in building design and just about everything.\\\\nThe last, if you will, 90% of the work is after the initial inspiration or the conceptual design is done. That part of it can be highly automated through AI. And so Quadro could be used as a platform that designs as well as generatively designs. And then lastly, a lot of people are using our workstations to also train their neural networks for these generative designs. And so you could train and develop your own networks and then apply it in the applications, okay?\\\\nSo AI, think of AI really as, in the final analysis, the future way of developing software. It\\'s a brand-new capability where computers can write its own software. And the software that\\'s written is so complex and so capable that no humans could write it ourselves. And so you could teach, you could use the data to teach a software to figure out how to write the software by itself.\\\\nAnd then when you\\'re done developing that software, you could use it to do all kinds of stuff, including design products. And so for workstations, that\\'s how it\\'s used.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question come from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Andrew Ellis,  B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division - Senior MD & Director of Research    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the very good quarterly execution. A lot of near-term items here on gaming. So I\\'ll switch it to longer term. Jensen, at CES, I think you said that there are now 200 million GeForce users globally. And if my math is correct, then that would be up about 2x over the last 3 to 4 years.\\\\nSo the question is, is there anything that you can see that would preclude that kind of growth over a similar period? And given the recent demand dynamics, I think we\\'ve seen that NVIDIA\\'s direct channels have been very good sources for GPUs at the prices that you intend. So as we look ahead, should we expect any change in channel management from the company?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks a lot, Craig. In the last several years, several dynamics happened at the same time. And all of it were the favorable contributions to today. First of all, gaming became a global market, and China became one of the largest gaming markets in the world.\\\\nBut second, because the market became so big, developers could invest extraordinary amounts into the production value of a video game. They could invest a few hundred million dollars and know that they\\'re going to get the return on it. Back when the video game industry was quite small or when PC industry -- PC gaming was small, it was too risky for a developer to invest that much.\\\\nAnd so now an investor, a developer could invest hundreds of millions of dollars and create something that is just completely photorealistic and immersive and just beautiful. And so the production -- when a production value goes up, the GPU technology that\\'s needed to run it well goes up. It\\'s very different than music, it\\'s very different than watching movies. Everything in video games is synthesized in real time. And so when the production value goes up, the ASP or the technology has to go up.\\\\nAnd then lastly, the size of the market, people have wondered how big the video game market is going to be. And I\\'ve always believed that the video game market is going to be literally everyone. In 10 years\\' time, 15 years\\' time, there\\'s going to be another 1 billion people on Earth. And those people are going to be gamers. We\\'re going to see more and more gamers.\\\\nAnd not to mention that, almost every single sport could be a virtual-reality sport. So video games is every sport. So eSport can be any sport and every sport and every type of sport. And so I think when you consider this and put that in your mind, I think the opportunity for video games is going to be quite large, and that\\'s essentially what we are seeing.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWilliam Shalom Stein,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m hoping we can touch on automotive a little bit more. In particular, I think, in the past, you\\'ve talked about expecting sort of a low revenue growth in this market until roughly the 2020 time frame when autonomous driving kicks in, in a more meaningful way. But of course, you have the AI copilot that seems to be potentially ramping sooner, and you have at least 1 marquee customer that is ramping now, I guess, but volumes aren\\'t quite that large on the autonomous driving side. So any guidance as to when we might see these 2 factors start to accelerate revenue in that end market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks a lot, Will. I wish I had more precision for you, but here are some of the dynamics that I believe in. I believe that autonomous capabilities -- autonomous driving, is the single greatest dynamic next to EVs in the automotive industry. And transportation is a $10 trillion industry. Between cars and shuttles and buses, delivery vehicles, I mean, it\\'s just an extraordinary, extraordinary market. And everything that\\'s going to move in the future will be autonomous. That\\'s for sure. And it will be autonomous fully, or it will be autonomous partly. The size of this marketplace is quite large. In the near term, I -- our path to that future, which I believe starts in 2020 -- 2019, 2020, but starts very strongly in 2022, I believe the path to that, in our case, has several elements. The first element is that in order for all these companies, whether they\\'re Tier 1s or startups or OEMs or taxi companies or ride-hailing companies or tractor companies or shuttle companies or pizza delivery shuttles, in order to deliver -- in order to create their autonomous driving capability, the first thing you have to do is train a neural network. And we\\'ve created a platform we call the NVIDIA DGX that allows everybody to train their neural networks as quickly as possible. So that\\'s first. The development of the AI requires GPUs, and we benefit first from that. The second is -- which we\\'ll start this year and next year, is development platforms for the cars themselves for the vehicles themselves. And finally, Xavier\\'s here. We have first silicon at Xavier\\'s, the most complex SOC that was ever made. And we\\'re super excited about the state of Xavier, and we\\'re going to be sampling it in Q1. And so now we\\'ll be able to help everybody create development systems. And there\\'ll be thousands and tens of thousands of quite expensive development systems based on Xavier and based on Pegasus that the world is going to need. And so that\\'s the second element. The third element, in the near term, will be development agreements. Each one of these projects are engineering-intensive, and there\\'s a development agreement that goes along with it. And so these 3 elements, these 3 components, are in the near term. And then hopefully, starting from 2019, going forward and very strongly going from 2022 and beyond, the actual car revenues and economics will show up. Appreciate that question. And I think this is our last question, yes?\\\\nWell, we had a record quarter, wrapping up a record year. We have a strong -- we had strong momentum in our gaming, AI, data center and self-driving car businesses. It\\'s great to see adoption of NVIDIA\\'s GPU computing platform increasing in so many industries. We accomplished a great deal this last year, and we have big plans for this coming year. Next month, the brightest minds in AI and the scientific world will come together at our GPU Technology Conference in San Jose. GTC has grown tenfold in the last 5 years. This year we expect more than 8,000 attendees. GTC is the place to be if you\\'re an AI researcher or doing any field of science where computing is your essential instrument. There will be over 500 hours of talks of recent breakthroughs and discoveries by leaders in the field, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and many others. Developers from industries ranging from health care to transportation to manufacturing and entertainment will come together and share state-of-the-art and AI. This is going to be a great GTC. I hope to see all of you there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This concludes today\\'s conference call.

Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We ended the first half of 2018 strong, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, driven by increased demand for our high-performance products.\\\\nSecond quarter revenue of $1.76 billion grew 53% year-over-year, and gross margin improved more than 3 percentage points, resulting in our highest quarterly net income in 7 years. We are very pleased with the year-over-year financial performance across both of our business segments as we continue to gain share driven by strong customer adoption of our new products in the PC, gaming and data center markets.\\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment, second quarter CG segment revenue increased 64% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our Radeon GPUs and a significant ramp of our Ryzen mobile processors. Ryzen unit shipments grew strong double-digit sequentially, as Ryzen mobile processor shipments more than doubled in the quarter. Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Huawei, Lenovo and Samsung launched dozens of Ryzen processor-based notebooks, which position us well to continue growing Ryzen mobile sales heading into the back-to-school and holiday seasons.\\\\nIn the commercial PC market, we launched our Ryzen PRO commercial mobile APUs in the quarter. For the first time in our history, all 3 major commercial OEMs: Dell, HP and Lenovo, now offer enterprise-class notebooks and desktops powered by AMD, and we are seeing strong initial interest as customers evaluate these new systems.\\\\nContinuing our strong roadmap execution, we launched our second generation Ryzen desktop CPU to very positive reviews in April, just 13 months after the first Ryzen desktop processors were released. Additionally, in June, we delivered the first public demonstration of our second generation AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors with the industry\\'s first 32-core PC processor designed for the high-end desktop market. We are on track to launch our second generation Threadripper processor in August, with leadership performance for the enthusiast and content creation markets.\\\\nOverall, we are very pleased with the market adoption of our Ryzen processors. 44 consumer and commercial Ryzen-based desktops and notebooks have been launched this year, and our customers remain on track to bring a total of 60 Ryzen-based systems to market in 2018.\\\\nIn Graphics, strong channel and data center demand drove significant year-over-year increases in revenue and ASPs. Sequentially, graphics revenue was down, primarily driven by lower blockchain-related sales, partially offset by stronger data center sales. Sales into the high-end enthusiast and performance portions of the gaming market grew substantially year-over-year based on the adoption of our latest Radeon RX 500 and Vega series GPUs. We continue to execute our software strategy to provide the best gaming experience in the industry with new AMD Radeon GPU drivers published for every major game launched in the quarter, and expanded partnerships with Ubisoft, Capcom and Rebellion to optimize their next generation of games on Radeon graphics.\\\\nOn the hardware side, we continued to expand the adoption of our Radeon Vega architecture with the introduction of new OEM systems and AIB cards in smaller and more mobile form factors. Samsung also announced they added our FreeSync technology to many of their high-end TVs, giving PC and console gamers the ultimate big screen gaming experience. The AMD FreeSync ecosystem is the broadest in the industry, with more than 400 FreeSync-enabled monitors and TVs in market to date.\\\\nData center GPU revenue increased significantly in the quarter, driven by Vega-based Radeon Instinct MI25 shipments. Our GPU engagements with large cloud customers continued to expand as we increased our investments in hardware and open software solutions in this important space. At COMPUTEX this year, we showed the first public demonstration of our next-generation 7-nanometer Radeon Vega GPU, which includes new features optimized for the artificial intelligence and machine learning markets. We started sampling of this product in the second quarter and we are on track to launch this next-generation product, the world\\'s first 7-nanometer GPU, later this year.\\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Second quarter segment revenue increased 37% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong semi-custom sales and growing adoption of our EPYC data center processors.\\\\nStarting with our server business, we celebrated our 1-year anniversary of the launch of our EPYC server processors with an increase of greater than 50% in both revenue and unit shipments sequentially. We have over 50 customer platforms now in market, including Cisco, who announced their highest density server offering ever powered by EPYC processors; and HP Enterprise who launched their first EPYC-based single-socket ProLiant server, which delivers significantly lower cost per virtual machine than the leading dual socket competitor.\\\\nWe also saw strong progress with our mega data center partners, as Tencent Cloud announced immediate availability of their SA1 Cloud service, delivering 30% lower cost per VM with outstanding performance across key workloads. Shipments for mega data center customers more than doubled in the quarter as we made significant progress towards qualification of production instances at multiple cloud providers in anticipation of deployments planned in the second half of this year. We\\'re also seeing momentum from Tier 2 next wave cloud service providers that have the ability to ramp quickly with a noted preference for the value and capability that our EPYC single-socket offering brings.\\\\nTurning to large enterprise customers. We added dozens of new end customers in the quarter. Our value proposition continues to be strong in segments like HPC, data analytics and in general-purpose virtualized enterprise environments. We are extremely focused on accelerating EPYC processor adoption in these targeted segments in the second half of the year.\\\\nFinally, I\\'m very pleased with our execution against our long-term roadmap. We received first silicon of our next-generation 7-nanometer EPYC processor with Zen 2, codename Rome, in the second quarter, and the silicon quality and bring up has gone very well. I am happy to report that we recently started sampling Rome to select partners for early validation, and we are on track to launch in 2019, strengthening our already outstanding competitive position in the market. We remain focused on our near-term milestone of achieving mid-single-digit server unit share by the end of 2018 on the path to our midterm goal of double-digit market share.\\\\nMoving on to our Semi-Custom and Embedded businesses. Semi-custom revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially in support of Sony and Microsoft game consoles. We are proud that Microsoft and Sony have collectively shipped well over 100 million AMD-powered game consoles in the current cycle. The game console market continues to be an important segment for us in the long term and we are well-positioned based on our strong partnerships and differentiated IT and design capabilities. Embedded sales increased by double-digit percentage year-over-year, driven by growth across the embedded gaming, industrial and medical imaging markets. We also saw strong initial design wins for our new EPYC and Ryzen Embedded product families following their launch last quarter. \\\\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter financial results. We delivered strong revenue growth, and margin expansion as demand for our new high-performance products continued to accelerate. Most importantly, we believe our long-term technology bets position us very well for the future. Several years ago, we made important decisions around our CPU and GPU roadmaps to drive leadership at the 7-nanometer node. We now have line of sight to those products coming to market and we see incredible opportunities ahead based on the competitive positioning and customer interest in our upcoming 7-nanometer products. We are confident that with continued execution, we are on an excellent trajectory to drive market share gains and growth in revenue and profitability. We are focused on that continued execution as we make significant investments in our hardware and software roadmaps to deliver even more compelling products to our customers in the 2019 and 2020 timeframe.\\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder, to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone.\\\\nQ2 was another strong quarter for AMD. Year-over-year, we grew revenue 53% and expanded gross margins 37%, while significantly growing operating margin and earnings per share. Quarterly revenue of $1.76 billion was higher year-over-year, driven by strength across all product lines. Gross margin was up 360 basis points year-over-year, driven by the ramp of new products.\\\\nOperating expenses were $467 million or 27% of revenue, down as a percentage of revenue from 34% a year ago. We are delivering operating leverage while launching new products and making strategic R&D investments to support our multi-generation -- multigenerational product roadmaps. R&D investments in the first half of 2018 increased 25% as compared to the first half of 2017 in support of our future product roadmaps.\\\\nOperating income grew to $186 million from $23 million a year ago. Operating margin was 11% and both our business segments reported double-digit operating margin percentage. Adjusted EBITDA was $228 million compared to $58 million a year ago, and, on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA has grown considerably to $666 million, resulting in gross debt leverage of 2.5x.\\\\nNet income was $156 million, a significant improvement compared to a loss of $7 million 1 year ago. This is our highest quarterly net income since 2011. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.14 using a diluted share count of 1,147 million, compared to a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago.\\\\nNow turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.1 billion, up 64% year-over-year, led by strong sales of both Radeon and Ryzen products. Ryzen products accounted for approximately 60% of client revenue, and we saw a particular strength in Ryzen Mobile processors in the second quarter as new notebook products continued to ramp.\\\\nStrong channel and data center demand drove year-over-year graphics revenue increases. Sequentially, graphics revenue was down, primarily driven by lower blockchain sales, partially offset by stronger data center sales. We believe blockchain-related revenue declined from approximately 10% of our revenue in the first quarter to approximately 6% of our overall revenue in the second quarter.\\\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating income was $117 million or 11% of segment revenue compared to operating income of $7 million 1 year ago. The significant increase was due to strong revenue growth coupled with improved operating expense leverage.\\\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $670 million, up 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by semi-custom and EPYC processor sales.  These results include higher-than-anticipated semi-custom revenue in Q2 due to higher inventory, with noncancelable purchase orders in accordance with ASC 606. EPYC processor units revenue grew greater than 50% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by mega data center sales. EESC operating income was $69 million or 10% of segment revenue, up from an operating income of $16 million a year ago on higher revenue. Q2 2017 operating income for EESC also included a licensing gain of $25 million.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $983 million at the end of the quarter. Free cash flow was negative $88 million in the second quarter due to working capital requirements in support of recent revenue growth. Inventory was $750 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.7 billion.\\\\nNow turning to our financial outlook. For the third quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.7 billion plus or minus $50 million. This would be an increase of approximately 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen and EPYC products, partially offset by lower sales of GPU products in the blockchain market. Sequentially, this would be a decrease of approximately 3%, with higher Ryzen and EPYC processor revenue offset by lower GPU revenue.\\\\nIn addition, we now expect semi-custom revenue to be lower sequentially in Q3 following higher-than-expected Q2 revenue. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, Q3 2017 revenue was $1.58 billion adjusted for ASC 606 revenue accounting standards.\\\\nIn addition, for Q3, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 38%, up from 36% in the prior year, driven by the ramp of Ryzen and EPYC product sales; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $470 million or 28% of revenue; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $35 million; and free cash flow to be positive.\\\\nFor the full year 2018, we continue to expect revenue growth of mid-20s percent, gross margin in excess of 37% and to be free cash flow positive.\\\\nIn closing, Q2 was an excellent quarter, and 2018 is expected to be a solid year. I am pleased with our business execution and financial results, driven by the strength of our high-performance product portfolio. We remain focused on executing our long-term financial model for revenue growth, margin expansion and improved profitability.\\\\nNow with that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready for our first question here in the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, for you. On the -- it seems Intel seems to have pushed their 10-nanometer volume ramp out into 2019, and I think a lot of people view your foundry 7-nanometer kind of the same ZIP code as their 10-nanometer. So I\\'m wondering if you could give us some context and/or color on what does this mean? Does -- is it -- if you\\'re at parity with Intel -- has AMD ever been at parity before with Intel? And does that change the conversation with your customers in terms of their interest in your products?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Mark. So look, in terms of our roadmaps, both on the CPU and GPU side, we made some important technology decisions a couple of years ago and we bet heavily on 7-nanometer. We thought 7-nanometer would be a big node for the industry and it would be important for us to be early in the adoption of 7-nanometer. So when you look at where we are today, especially on the CPU side, we have first silicon of our Rome product. It looks very good. We also have a good number of architectural improvements and enhancements in Zen 2 that will come with 7-nanometer technology. So we\\'re very pleased with where we are and where the competitive positioning is. And I would say, to your question about how is it perceived, I think customers are very interested in where we are. I mean, clearly, we have to execute. But with our current generation Naples, customers have certainly gotten to understand our architecture with the improvements that we have going into 7-nanometer with Rome. I think there is enhanced interest and from a competitive positioning standpoint, we do believe we have an excellent competitive position going into 2019. So we are very, very excited about that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          A follow-up, if I may. As we look at the double-digit bogey for next year on servers, is that -- do you need EPYC 2 to get to that? And what are the risks on bringing that to market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Mark, we view the double-digit share goal as an important share goal. I think it certainly will come with the second generation of EPYC, so the Zen 2 product. But I view that as a journey, right? I mean, we have now sort of 3 generations that we have: we have Zen 1 that\\'s in the market today, we have Zen 2 that\\'s well into the productization phase and then we have a very strong roadmap around Zen 3 as well. So we feel good about our competitive position and the path to double-digit market share. I think this is all about rate and pace and we\\'re working very, very closely with our customers to accelerate that ramp. And actually, I was very pleased. I mentioned in the prepared remarks earlier that in the second quarter, we saw some nice acceleration of the mega data center customers so we saw units there more than double, and that\\'s an indication that were getting the right level of engagement and progress with our large customers.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more detail into the foundry strategy at 7-nanometers. And kind of how much flexibility do you have between your 2 foundry partners? And to what extent if one of them is having trouble on the 7, does the Wafer Supply Agreement kind of give you the ability to move capacity without having to pay for wafers?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, John. So a couple of years ago, we did amend the Wafer Supply Agreement. It was a very strategic agreement for us as we look over the long term. So at 7-nanometer, we are engaged with both TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES. I would say that we do have, on a product-by-product basis, the choice between the foundries and we make those decisions on a product-by-product basis. But in terms of our long-term roadmap and how we feel about it, both on the GPU and CPU side, the main message is, we don\\'t believe process technology is going to be a gate for us. We have a lot of architectural work, a lot of architectural improvements, but we don\\'t believe process technology is a gate for our roadmap.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then Lisa as my second question, can you help me better understand, because one of the things I know you\\'ve been working on aggressively with the launch of EPYC 2 is your ability to cover a broader swath of workloads and just increase kind of the server TAM you can go after. So can you help quantify to me kind of as you go from EPYC 1 to EPYC 2 what that growth in workload coverage looks like? And importantly, as you continue to broaden out, how do we think about the R&D burden from here?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, John. So when we go from the first generation of EPYC to the second generation of EPYC, I do think that there are some improvements that we\\'ll make in the architecture that will expand the TAM. But from a TAM standpoint, we are not limited. I mean, I view our coverage today as 80% of the TAM. And yes, some workloads are really clean kills, and other workloads are closer, but we are servicing a large portion of the TAM. I think the value proposition increases with some of the architectural improvements that we\\'ve made in the second generation of EPYC, but from the standpoint of TAM, I think we feel good about it. From an R&D standpoint, and Devinder made the comment on our prepared remarks, that we did increase R&D by 25% year-on-year, but I think we\\'ve done it in a very responsible way. So we have revenue growth. We\\'re seeing margin expansion, which is a very, very key piece of our business model. And then we will increase R&D and go-to-market resources effectively. But I don\\'t believe that we will ever increase our OpEx ahead of revenue. I think it\\'s a balance between each of those lines. So we have these -- I think, we have a strong roadmap at this point, and we\\'ll look for opportunities to increase R&D, particularly on the software side, actually. I think we have a lot of opportunity on the software side across CPUs and GPUs to accelerate some of our machine learning work. And so that\\'s where incremental R&D would go.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then if I could sneak one last one in, Lisa, just on the GPU side, I think this is the second or third quarter in a row that you\\'ve highlighted incremental gains inside of the data center. Can you help size what that represents as a percent of revenue today? And I guess, more importantly, as you bring to market the 7-nanometer GPU part, how you\\'re think about exploiting that in the data center and kind of the TAM expectations, the revenue expectations we should have over the next kind of 4 to 8 quarters?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So on the GPU side, there\\'s no question that the demand for GPUs in the data center are growing very quickly, even faster than on the CPU side, for sure. And our data center engagements -- our focus on the GPU side is very cloud-centric. So large customers, places where are GPU capability can be well targeted. I would say the size of the business is still small, so we are growing, but it is still small. But there\\'s lots of interest in our current generation MI25. And there\\'s even more interest in our 7-nanometer Vega GPU that\\'s coming to market later this year. So we expect an opportunity to grow that segment over the next 4 to 8 quarters. And as you can see in the market, overall, the GPU segment is growing quite a bit in data centers. And so we\\'ll continue to invest heavily in this area.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wanted to just start with a clarification and then I have a follow-up. What\\'s the assumption for blockchain revenue in Q3 and for the full year? And just if you have an updated view of overall 2018 sales growth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, Vivek. So let me take that, and then Devinder can add as necessary. So for Q2, we were approximately 6% of revenue for blockchain. For Q3, we\\'re planning very little blockchain, so we expected it to be down in the second half, but we\\'re planning very little in Q3. And so if you update that on a full year basis, for 2018, blockchain will be lower than what we had previously discussed in the last earnings call. So I would say, previously, we said mid- to high-single digits, I think this will be a more on the mid-single digit side. And we\\'ll continue to watch the market develop over the next couple of quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right. And then, Lisa, have you seen any competitive response from Intel so far in either PCs or servers? For example, some of your desktop parts saw some ASP decline. Was it just mix or price competition? Or anything else that we should keep in mind?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, Vivek. So let me take each of the segments separately. So if you look at the PC segment, what we have seen is basically a ramping of our product portfolio. Certainly, in desktop, we had some mix here in the second quarter where we increased the percentage of the APUs that were being sold into the desktop channel segment, and so you saw a little bit of a mix to -- a bit softer desktop ASPs. But overall, when I look overall, I would say that the competitive situation is about what I would expect. There\\'s product competition, and we see that. We do ensure that there is good transition of products. So when we moved from our first generation Ryzen to our second generation Ryzen, we had some channel programs to make sure that we manage channel inventory on the first generation. But we\\'ve seen nothing that I would call unusual. And on the notebook side, actually, I\\'m pretty pleased, because we\\'re really seeing the notebook side of the business pick up and so mobile ASPs were up. The percentage of Ryzen units in mobile were up and we see that continuing into the second half of the year. And then on the EPYC side, again, I would say that the competition is really product based and for us, there\\'s some workload optimization that we do with customers, but I haven\\'t seen anything that\\'s unusual relative to the pricing environment and, in fact, as EPYC ramps, our ASPs are going up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right. And one last quick one, if I may. When should we expect to see the breakout quarter for EPYC, Lisa? Will that be Q3, Q4? What\\'s the visibility around that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think we are very focused on ensuring we deliver that mid-single-digit unit share at the end of 2018. I think as we go into the second half of the year, I would still see it as fourth quarter would be a real important quarter for us. I think we\\'ll see ramps into third quarter. And the key is, as you know, with some of these cloud partners, their -- it\\'s actually important when they actually ramp these larger instances. And so lots of visibility into work being done and the exact timing will depend on our customers\\' ramps.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, a couple questions on the server business, and then I\\'ll follow-up on a couple of PC things. In server, you guys have sort of laid out this mid-singles unit share number by the end of this year. And maybe you can walk us through that with a little bit of granularity, like how do you balance the what seems to be really high demand within the cloud customer base for Rome versus pushing volumes in the near-term of Naples? And I think some folks had asked a couple of questions around process nodes and you\\'re obviously sampling already with Rome, so maybe you could be explicit about where you\\'re manufacturing that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure. So a couple of different questions here, Matt. On the EPYC, your question is Naples versus Rome and how we manage that. Look, our focus from sales and go-to-market standpoint right now is on Naples. First generation EPYC, we have a lot of platforms in market, over 50 platforms in market. There are a lot of customers that have systems in their labs going through various stages of qualification, and we\\'re very focused on supporting that and ensuring that we see that ramp into the second half of the year. Rome is really a 2019 story. I think the good part about it is I expect that customers perhaps took a little bit longer in their initial qualification and sort of work around Naples, and our hope is that, as we go into Rome, you\\'ll see those qualification timelines tighten up a little bit. But no question that for 2018, it\\'s a Naples story, and there\\'s a lot of customer interest around Rome, and we will manage that. But we want to make sure that we also do as much of the validation work on our side before we sample too broadly. I think the good news is there\\'s a lot of interest and it\\'s really just on us to execute cleanly through the next couple of quarters. And Matt, you had some other questions or...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I mean, the last on there on server was about manufacturing for Rome, and then I\\'ll just -- talk about some -- one thing on the PC side, particularly notebooks, one of the questions I\\'m getting most often from investors is as the product portfolio from AMD improves dramatically, and I think will again as you guys go to 7-nanometer, it seems like winning sell-in share with OEMs is something that you guys have a bit of control of. But I wanted to ask a little bit about sell-through and consumer adoption and sort of mindshare around your client products. Intel has wound down a little bit some of the Intel Inside marketing program, and I know you maybe have some opportunities there. Maybe you could talk about some of the steps that your marketing team is making to sort of maybe change and refresh some of the consumer perception of the products relative to how quickly they have improved fundamentally?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely. So Matt, on your first question relative to the manufacturing of the second generation of EPYC. So as I said earlier, we are working with both TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 7-nanometer. As for the 7-nanometer Rome that we\\'re currently sampling, that\\'s being manufactured at the TSMC. And then your second question about where we are in that PS -- PC market, sell-in versus sellout share -- actually, it\\'s a great question. It\\'s a great question. And when I look at the PC market, we have great relationships with the OEMs. I mean, you can see it from the number of platforms that we have out there. But there\\'s no question that there\\'s opportunity for us to get the consumer perception and the commercial enterprise perception up. And so we\\'ve been very focused on that and that comes with additional investment in go-to-market expenses. So getting the Ryzen brand out there, getting the Radeon brand out there, it includes additional training at some key retailers to ensure that they know how to sell Ryzen and they know what the value proposition is. And what we see is some clear signs of early momentum in sellout. So as our platforms launched here in the month of June, we actually saw on quite a few of the outlets that they\\'ve actually sold out of our product and we\\'ve had to restock that here quickly. And as we go into the second half of the year, I think you\\'ll see, in both back-to-school and in holidays globally, that we have a larger presence of assortment than we have had in the past. So that\\'s a clear focus for us in the PC market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First, I wanted to ask about Ryzen share. I thought I heard you say that Ryzen was 60% of your CPU revenues in the quarter. I thought that\\'s what you said it was last quarter as well. So how do I reconcile that with the other color around the sequential growth of Ryzen into Q2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Stacy, it was approximately 60%. And when you look at it on a quarter-on-quarter basis, we had more units overall in desktop and notebook. Particularly in notebook, we saw an acceleration of Ryzen mobile units in the notebooks. So it\\'s an approximate number, it\\'s not an exact number, but it\\'s approximately 60%. We also saw some legacy business increase, and that\\'s why you see that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. So basically, it\\'s maybe like a little below 60% before, and like a little above 60% now but kind of around 60%?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          In that range, exactly.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. For my second question, you said you had EPYC up more than 50% sequentially. I think it doubled last quarter, it\\'s up 50% this quarter. But I think you\\'re still running, call it, 1%, maybe little kind of in that ballpark of share. So if you\\'re going to get 5% [x] in the year, I mean you\\'ve got to probably triple or more the current run rate by Q4. And I know you had mentioned earlier that Q4 was going to be kind of like an important quarter. Is that the kind of, I guess, ramp rate or run rate you\\'re actually thinking about this EPYC business into the back half of the year in order to meet your targets?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Stacy. I mean, I think, we view an acceleration as we go into the second half of the year, particularly as some of these guys go into larger production. But yes, there are a significant number of more units. I think we just see a pipeline that can accomplish that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. One quick housekeeping, just why did the accounts receivable go up so much?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sorry, I didn\\'t get the question, Stacy?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Accounts receivable.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sorry. Accounts receivable, why did they go up so much?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. It went up, primarily, it\\'s higher revenue and timing of collections. So that\\'s the main reason. In addition, there was an increase in this associated unbilled AR for semi-custom revenue, which, as you know, is recognized under ASC 606. That -- those parts have not shipped, but they get recognized as revenue, and that\\'s it says, unbilled AR under the AR line.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the Chinese JV and the product that\\'s being developed there that you\\'ve licensed? Can you talk about when you expect to see that product emerge? And how do you think about that sort of AMD proper competing with the JV within those Chinese customers? Are you agnostic to who wins or just how should we think about that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Joe. So we did start this Chinese JV a couple of years ago and the whole idea was to get more share in the domestic China market. The partnership has gone well, the product development is going well. We view the product as complementary to our current portfolio. So I think from that standpoint, we will continue to sell sort of AMD EPYC into the China market. And then for a certain domestic China applications, I think the China JV product will be available. They have not yet announced the exact timing of that, so I\\'ll wait until the official announcement of it. But so far, it\\'s gone as expected and I think the product development has gone quite well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, a couple of questions. The timing of the Ryzen version of 7-nanometer after EPYC, when will that happen in 2019? Is that a quarter after or 6 months, just the timing? And the second question is, how many of the mega data center guys are you actually engaged with at the moment?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, okay. So Hans, on the timing of the 7-nanometer Ryzen, I would just keep it as it\\'s after the 7-nanometer EPYC. So we\\'ll launch 7-nanometer EPYC first. I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s very far out, but I would say it\\'s after. And then in terms of mega data centers, we are engaged with all of them in some way, shape or form across CPU and GPU. On the CPU standpoint, I would say we are heavily engaged with 5.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Edward Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Question. Just again on EPYC, you are very clear that it was going to be about 4 quarters in qualification before your customers would start deployment. With EPYC 2, are there any programs in place or can we expect there to be a shorter amount of time before that could be deployed?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Kevin. So I believe -- and, of course, we\\'ll have to see how this plays out. But I think with EPYC, there were some customers who waited for us to completely qualify before they started, let\\'s call it, their own evals, and that\\'s to be understood because we were sort of returning to the market. I think with the second generation of EPYC, one would expect that there would be some customers who would do, let\\'s call it, parallel qualifications with our own qualifications. And so I think there is an opportunity to sort of overlap some of that work, and certainly, that\\'s part of the reason that we\\'ve started early sampling as early as we have to try to parallelize some of that activity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nKevin Edward Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. And on the GPU traction you\\'re getting in the data center, is there a high attach rate with your EPYC processors? Or is that just an independent traction?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I would say, at the moment, sort of for 2018-type revenue, they are independent engagements at the moment. I think, as we move into the 7-nanometer node with both EPYC and our Vega 7-nanometer, there will be more of an attach rate, and there is more interest, frankly, in that attach.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          How should we think about OpEx growth over the next several quarters? It seems like you\\'ve been growing OpEx kind of in the 20%-plus range? Should that moderate going forward or should we expect that to stay relatively stable?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think, the first thing is if you look at our model that we\\'ve laid out, we\\'ve said the long-term target model to stay within the range of 26% to 30%. This year, with the revenue guide at the Q in the mid-20s, we\\'re guiding to about 28% OpEx to revenue. Year-over-year basis, you\\'re right, we have increased it, and largely, those increases have been in R&D. If you look on the first half of 2017 to the first half of 2018, OpEx is up, but it\\'s largely weighted towards the R&D side. We are pleased with the operating leverage that we are getting from a company standpoint with the increase in revenue, but at the same time, targeted investments very heavily in the product roadmaps, and some of the things that you heard Lisa just talked about from the products and all of the multiple levers that we have to increase revenue, we are definitely investing in those areas.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And as a follow-up, Lisa, it\\'s been a little bit over a year since you laid out your long-term financial model. I realize crypto has been sort of a tailwind since then. But is it fair to say that you guys are on track to hit the $0.75 and above EPS number ex crypto?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think, Toshi, if you look at the long-term financial model and put aside sort of temporal things, and we feel that we are on track towards that long-term financial model. In some places, we are ahead; in some places, we are on track; but overall, I think we feel good about where we are towards the long-term financial model.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWayne A. Loeb,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Wayne Loeb for Chris Danely. What kind of performance improvement will 7-nanometer EPYC have over the current one?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Wayne, I think we are -- we\\'re not yet getting into details of what the performance improvement is of the 7-nanometer EPYC. So I think we\\'ll have more details on the architecture and where we are in performance later this year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWayne A. Loeb,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          As a follow-up, you talked about your goal of mid-single-digit share for EPYC by end of the year. At end of the year, what do you think your share would be in desktops and notebooks?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think we\\'ll continue to make progress in desktops and notebooks. In particular, I think, we expect that the notebook share will increase as we go into the second half of the year. Obviously, the PC market overall is doing a little bit better than most people expected and so we\\'ll have to see how the market does. But from our standpoint, we don\\'t have a specific share target out there for end of this year. We believe we\\'ll continue to gain share based on what we see in design wins at this point.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m sorry, if you addressed it earlier on the call. What is the timing for the 7-nanometer GPU? And then my related question on GPU is, could you just update us on what\\'s the progress on the software ecosystem, and specifically, in competition with the mode -- seemingly, huge mode that Nvidia has built with CUDA.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Ambrish. So our 7-nanometer GPU is -- started sampling here in the second quarter, and we will launch it later this year. So it will launch -- we expect it to launch in 2018. As it relates to the software ecosystem, we\\'re making good progress. We\\'re making incremental progress each quarter. And the important thing and the reason -- our strategy right now in GPUs in the data center is to engage with sort of large cloud guys who have the ability to work with us and, in some sense, we\\'re focusing our software efforts on their needs first. And that allows us to kind of do this sort of vertical by vertical. So I think we\\'re making good progress. It\\'s a multiyear effort, and we are very clear that it\\'s a multiyear effort, but we have seen some initial positive momentum and we\\'re going to continue to invest in this space. So it\\'s the #1 investment priority for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So in data center, Lisa, sorry, just a quick follow-up. What areas have you been able to gain traction in within the -- and it\\'s a pretty large area, but within machine learning, where specifically have you been able to wedge yourself in?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, again, we\\'re working with several cloud vendors on sort of key applications in their data center.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Ambrish. Operator, we have time for 2 more questions, please?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No problem. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I just -- I apologize to continue to go back to EPYC, but just curious, as we think about the ramp, you\\'ve mentioned that you have over 50 platforms now in the market. I\\'m just curious if you were asked to characterize how many of those were shipping in volume, and what your expectation would be through the course of the remainder of this year in terms of those turning into true meaningful volumes?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so I\\'m thinking about that. I would say a number of those platforms -- a large majority of those platforms are shipping to multiple customers. So volume, of course, is all relative. But -- and the way we count platforms are, obviously, platforms from the OEMs as well as platforms from ODMs and a number of the cloud guys are doing their own platforms or specific platforms. So I would say a large number of those, the majority of those would have -- are shipping to multiple customers. And production -- sort of the scale of the production is what -- is customer dependent. So some of them are in hundreds of units, some of them are in thousands of units, some of them are in tens of thousands of units and -- different scale of numbers.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, fair enough. And then as a quick follow-up, as we think about the ramp of some of your new platforms going forward and we kind of tie that to your long-term gross margin target of, I think it was 40% to 44%, can you just remind us again of how we can think about the mix in terms of the margin profile of some of the new businesses ramping? And how quickly maybe we should consider that 40-plus percent target of gross margin?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, we\\'re guiding the third quarter to 38% gross margin. That\\'s largely on the strength of the new product portfolio. I think what we said before, which still holds, is our Ryzen, our EPYC, our Radeon data center products are all, in aggregate, over 50% from a gross margin standpoint. They\\'re well above the corporate average. I think we\\'re starting to see the mix and that margin accretion of the new products, and so we\\'ll continue to do that over the next couple of quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So, I guess, it\\'s fair to -- yes, I guess I\\'m just trying to -- I guess given the commentary around the fourth quarter and EPYC, really that being an important quarter, could we assume that gross margin from here continues to trend higher?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, I think it\\'s fair to say that, as we go into the second half of the year, our new products will be a larger percentage of our overall product revenue. And that is positive from a margin standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [73]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [74]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had 2. I guess, when I look at the stock there\\'s not -- I\\'m not sure that there\\'s a lot of doubt about the share gain targets this year. But maybe there is some question about the ability to sustain those targets next year and the year after. So I guess the question -- first question is, what are you doing differently this time that was not done in the Opteron cycle? Are you giving customers more visibility to your roadmap?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Tim, I think the major thing that we\\'re doing differently as a company and certainly around EPYC, is we are doing what we said we were going to do. We laid out a 5-year roadmap to what we wanted to do in servers. We told them what first generation EPYC would look like. It came out a little bit better than they expected. We told them when to expect second generation EPYC and what we were trying to do with that. And I\\'m really pleased to say that we\\'re exactly on track to what we said we were going to do. And we have a third generation behind that. So our focus is to execute really, really well and provide the customers the differentiation in the value proposition to consider us as a long-term partner. We are not after what happens over the next 2 quarters. I mean, this is extraordinarily -- it\\'s a journey for us with EPYC, and I think we feel good about what we\\'ve done and the entire team is focused on delivering what we said we were going to do.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it, Lisa. And I guess, just the last question is really around the strategic foundry roadmap beyond 7-nanometer. Clearly, you have a lead now that -- because Intel is going to really, I think, functionally skip over 10-nanometer, which is great, and maybe it was -- it\\'s a little bit unexpected given when you began development of these parts. But how do you think strategically beyond 7-nanometer as you move to 5-nanometer with your partner? And where Intel will be at that time?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [77]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          What we see in the foundry roadmap is actually a very nice cadence of technologies. So we do believe 7-nanometer will be a large node. There will be derivatives of 7-nanometer: 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer plus. We have seen the first view of 5-nanometer, and we think 5-nanometer is very competitive as well. So again, our goal is to use the best that process technology can offer in the foundry market, and then differentiate on architecture and sort of product positioning and those kinds of things.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [78]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session.

In March, we introduced our newest GPU architecture, Pascal. This extraordinary scalable design built on the16 nanometer finFET process provides massive performance and exceptional power efficiency. It will enable us to extend our leadership across our four specialized platforms, gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive. \\\\nYear-on-year revenue growth continued to accelerate, increasing 13% to $1.3 billion. Our GPU business grew 15% to $1.08 billion from a year ago. Tegra processor business was up 10% to $160 million. Growth continued to be broad-based across all four platforms. Record performance in datacenter was driven by the adoption of deep learning across multiple industries. In Q1, our four platforms contributed nearly 87% of revenue, up from 81% a year earlier. They collectively increased 21% year-over-year. \\\\nLet\\'s start out with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue increased 17% year-on-year to $687 million, momentum carried forward from the holiday season, helped by the continued strength of Maxwell-based GTX processors. Last weekend at DreamHack Austin, we unveiled GeForce GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, our first Pascal GPUs for gamers. They represent a quantum leap for gaming and immersive VR experiences, delivering the biggest performance gains from the previous generation architect in a decade. \\\\nMedia reports and gamers have been unanimously enthusiastic. The Verge wrote, what NVIDIA is doing with its new GTX 1000 series is bringing yesteryear\\'s insane high-end into 2016\\'s mainstream. We also extended our VR platform, by adding spatial acoustics to our VRWorks software development kit that helps provided an even greater sense of presence within VR. \\\\nWe introduced simultaneous multi-projection, enabling accurate efficient projection of the real world to surround monitors, VR headsets, as well as future displays. To showcase these technologies, we created our own amazing open-source game called NVIDIA VR Funhouse available on Steam. In addition, we\\'ve announced Dazzle, an in-game photography system which enables gamers to capture high-resolution and VR scenes within their favorite games. \\\\nMoving to professional visualization. Quadro grew year-on-year for the second consecutive quarter. Revenue rose 4% to $189 million. Growth came from higher-end products and mobile workstations. \\\\nWe\\'ve launched the M6000 24 gig, and are seeing good success among multiple customers, including Toyota and Pixar. [Roche] is using the M6000 to speed its DNA sequencing pipeline by 8 times, enabling more affordable genetic testing. We see exciting opportunities for our Quadro platform with Virtual Reality, and NVIDIA Iray, a photorealistic rendering tool that enables designers effectively to walk around their creations, and make real-time adjustments. \\\\nMoving to datacenter, revenue was a record $143 million, up 63% year-on-year, and up [40%] sequentially, reflecting enormous growth in deep learning. In just a few years, deep learning has moved from academia, and is now being adopted across the hyperscale landscape. We expect growing deployment in the coming year, among large enterprises. \\\\nGPUs have become the accelerator of choice for hyperscale datacenters due to their superior programmability, computational performance and power efficiency. Our Tesla M4 is over 50% more power efficient than other programmable accelerators for applications such as real-time image classification for AlexNet, a deep learning framework. Hyperscale companies are the fastest adopters of deep learning, accelerating their growth in our Tesla business. Starting from infancy three years ago, hyperscale revenue is now similar to that from high-performing computing. \\\\nNVIDIA GPUs today accelerate every major deep learning framework in the world. We power IBM Watson and Facebook\\'s Big Sur server [through our] AI, and we are in AI platforms at hyperscale giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, AliBaba and Baidu, for both training and real-time imprints. Twitter has recently said, they used NVIDIA GPUs to help users discover the right content among the millions of images and videos shared every day. \\\\nDuring the quarter, we hosted our seventh annual GPU Technology Conference. The event drew record attendance, with 5,500 scientists, engineers, designers and others across a wide range of fields, and featured 600 sessions and 200 exhibitors. At GTC, we unveiled the Tesla P100, the world\\'s advanced GPU accelerator based on the Pascal architecture. The P100 utilizes a combination of technologies including NVLink, a high-speed interconnect [allowing] application performance to scale on multiple GPUs, high memory bandwidth, and multiple hardware features designed to natively accelerate AI applications. The Next Platform, an enterprise IT site, called it a beast, in all of the good sense of that word. \\\\nAmong the first customers for our Pascal accelerator with the Swiss National Computer Center, which will use it to double its speed of Europe\\'s fastest supercomputer. And GTC, we also announced the DGX-1, the world\\'s first deep learning supercomputer. Loaded with eight P100s in a single box, interconnected with MVLink, it provides the deep learning performance equivalent to 250 traditional servers. DGX-1 comes loaded with a suite of software designed to aid AI and application developers. \\\\nUniversities, hyperscale vendors and large enterprises developing AI-based applications are showing strong interest in the system. Among the first to get DGX-1, will be the Massachusetts General Hospital. It launched an initiative that applies AI techniques to improve the detection, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases, drawing on its database of some10 billion medical images. In our GRID graphics virtualization business, we are seeing interest across a variety of industries, ranging from manufacturing, energy, education, government and financial services. \\\\nFinally in automotive, revenue continued to grow reaching $113 million, up 47% year-over-year, and up 22% sequentially, reflecting the growing popularity of premium infotainment features in mainstream cars. NVIDIA is working closely with partners to develop self-driving cars, using our end-to-end platform with Tesla in the datacenter, and extends with the deployment with DRIVE PX 2. Since we have unveiled DRIVE PX 2 earlier this year, worldwide interest has continued to grow among car makers, tier 1 suppliers, and others. We are now collaborating with more than 80 companies, using the open architecture of DRIVE PX to develop their own software and driving experiences. \\\\nAt GTC, we demonstrated the world\\'s first self-driving car, trained using deep learning, and showed its ability to navigate on roads without lane markings, even in bad weather. Additionally, we announced that DRIVE PX 2 will serve as the brain behind the new Roborace initiative in the Formula E racing circuit. The circuit will include 10 teams, racing identical cars, all using DRIVE PX 2. Beyond our four platforms, our OEM IP business was $173 million, down 21% year-on-year, reflecting weak PC demand. \\\\nNow turning to the rest of the income statement. We had record GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter, at 57.5% and 58.6%, respectively. Driving these margins was the strength of our Maxwell GPUs, the success of our platform approach, and strong demand for deep learning. \\\\nGAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $506 million, and declined from $539 million in Q4 on lower restructuring charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $443 million, flat sequentially and up 4% from a year earlier, reflecting increased hiring for our growth initiatives, and development-related expenses associated with Pascal. GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $245 million, up 39% from a year earlier. \\\\nNon-GAAP operating income was $322 million, also up 39%. Non-GAAP operating margins improved more than 470 basis points from a year ago to 24.7%. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $196 million. Non-GAAP net income was $263 million, up 41% fueled by the strong revenue growth, and improved gross and operating margins. \\\\nDuring the first quarter, we\\'d entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, and paid $62 million in quarterly cash dividends. Since the restart of our capital return program in the fourth quarter of FY13, we have returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders. This represents over 100% of our cumulative free cash flow for FY13 through this Q1. For FY17, we intend to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. \\\\nNow turning to the outlook for the second quarter of FY17. We expect revenue to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.7% and 58.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. \\\\nGAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter FY17 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary, and other information available on our IR website. \\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) \\\\nFirst question, Vivek Arya, Bank of America. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you for taking my question, and good job on the results and the guidance. \\\\nMaybe as my first one, Jen-Hsun, how do you assess the competitive landscape in PC gaming? AMD recently claimed to be taking a lot of share, and they are launching a Polaris soon. \\\\nIf you could just walk us through, what does NVIDIA to better than AMD? So that helps you maintain your competitive edge in this market, and what impact does Pascal have in that? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Vivek, thank you. \\\\nOur PC gaming platform, GeForce is strong and getting stronger than ever, and I think the reason for that is several-folds. First of all, our GPU architecture is just superior, and we dedicated an enormous amount of effort to advancing our GPU architecture. I think the engineering of NVIDIA is exquisite, and our craftsmanship is really unrivaled anywhere. \\\\nThe scale of our company in building GPUs is the highest and the largest of any company in the world. This is what we do, this is the one job that we do. And so, it is not surprising to me that NVIDIA\\'s GPU technology is further ahead than any time in its history. \\\\nThe second thing, however, it\\'s just so much more than just chips anymore as you know. Over the last 10 years, we\\'ve started to evolve our Company to much more of a platform company. And it\\'s about developing all of the algorithms that sit on top of our GPUs. \\\\nGPU is a general purpose processor. It\\'s a general-purpose processor that is dedicated to a particular field of computing, such that it is computer graphics here, physics simulation, et cetera. But the thing that\\'s really important all of the algorithms that sit on top of it. And we have a really fantastic team computational of mathematicians that captures our algorithms and our know-how into GameWorks, into the physics engine, and recently the really amazing work that we\\'re doing in VR that we have embodied into VRWorks. \\\\nAnd then, lastly, lastly it is about making sure that the experience always just works. We have a huge investment, in working with game developers all over the world. From the moment that the game is being conceived of, all the way to the point that it is launched.  \\\\nAnd we optimize the games on our platform. We make sure that our drivers run perfectly. And even before a gamer downloads or buys into a game, we\\'ve already updated their software so that it works perfectly when they install the game. And we call that GFE, GeForce Experience. \\\\nAnd so, Vivek, it\\'s really about a top to bottom approach. And I haven\\'t even started talking about all of the marketing work that we do, in engaging the developers, and engaging the gamers all over the world. This is really a network platform, and all of our platform partners that take our platform to market. And so it\\'s a pretty extensive network, and it\\'s a pretty extensive platform. And it\\'s so much more than chips anymore. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Thank you, Jen-Hsun. \\\\nAnd as my follow up, so things like data center products were the big upside surprise in Q1, grew over 60% from last year. Could you give us some more  color on what drove that upside? Was it the initial Pascal launch? Is that impact still to come?  And just broadly, what trends are you seeing there in HPC, versus some of these new AI projects that you\\'re involved with? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks. \\\\nYou know that I have been rather enthusiastic about high-performance computing for some time. We\\'ve been evolving our GPU platforms, so that it\\'s better at general-purpose computing than ever. And almost every single data center in the world, every single server company in the world are working with us, to build servers that are based on GPUs, based on video GPUs and high-performance computing. \\\\nOne of the most important areas of high-performance computing has been this area called deep learning. And this deep learning -- deep learning as you know, as you are probably starting to hear, is a brand-new computing model that takes advantage of the massively parallel processing capability of the GPU, along with the big data that many companies have, to essentially have software write algorithms by itself. \\\\nDeep learning is a very important field of machine learning, and machine learning is now the process of revolutionizing artificial intelligence, making machines more and more intelligent, and using it to discover insights that quite frankly, is impossible otherwise. And so, this particular field was first adopted by hyperscale companies, so that they could find insight, and make recommendations, and make predictions from the billions of customer transactions they have every day. \\\\nNow it is in the process of moving into enterprises, but in the meantime hyperscale companies are now the process of deploying our GPUs, and deep learning applications into production. And so, we\\'ve been talking about this area for some time, and now we\\'re starting to see the broad deployment in production. So we\\'re quite excited about that. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Mark Lipacis, Jefferies. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking my questions. \\\\nA first question, the growth in the Tesla business is impressive, and in looking back, it seemed like that business actually decelerated in 2015, which was a head-scratcher for me. And I wonder do you think that your customers in that business paused in anticipation of Pascal? Or do you think it is the AI apps and deep learning applications that are just hitting their stride right now? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, decelerate, I guess, I\\'m not sure I recall that. The thing about HPC, about GPU computing is, as you know this is a new computing model, and we\\'ve been promoting this computing model for close to seven years. And a new computing model doesn\\'t come along very frequently. In fact, as I know it, I do not know if there\\'s a new computing model that\\'s used anywhere, that has been revolutionary in the last 20 years. \\\\nAnd so, GPU computing took some time to develop. We\\'ve been evangelizing it for quite some time. We developed robust tools, so that would make it easier for people to take advantage of our GPUs. We have industry expertise in a large number of industries now. \\\\nWe have APIs that have been created for each one of the industries. We\\'ve been working with the ecosystem in each one of the industries, and developers in each one of the industries. And as of this time, we have quite a large handful, quite a large number of industries that we accelerate applications for. \\\\nAnd so, I think that  -- I guess, my recommendation -- my recollection would be is that, that it has taken a long time, in fact, to have made GPU computing into a major, new computing model. But I think at this point, it is pretty clear that it\\'s going mainstream. \\\\nIt is really one of the best ways to achieve post Moore\\'s law error of computing acceleration, and a lot of (inaudible) competition. And the one that, of course, that is very big deal is deep learning and machine learning. This particular field is a brand-new, new way of doing computing for a large number of companies, and we\\'re seeing traction all over the place. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Steven Chin, UBS. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hey, thanks for taking my questions. \\\\nJen-Hsun or Colette, first of all I want to see if you can help provide some color on some of the drivers of growth for fiscal 2Q, whether most of it is coming from Pascal possibly in the gaming market, or in the Tesla products, or if there was also some outgrowth and Tegra automotive as called for fiscal 2Q? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Stephen, I would expect that all of our businesses grow in Q2. And so, it is across the board. \\\\nWe are seeing great traction in gaming. Gaming as you know, has multiple growth drivers covers. But partly of the gaming is growing, because the production value of game is growing, partly because the number of people who are playing is growing. E-sports is more popular sport than ever, sports spectatorship is more popular than ever. \\\\nAnd so, gaming is just a larger and larger market, and it\\'s surprising everybody. And the quality of games is going up, which means that the complexity of GPUs has to go up. \\\\nHigh-performance computing has grown, and the killer app is machine learning and deep learning. And that\\'s going to continue to go into production from the hyperscale companies, as we expand our region to enterprises all over the world now. Companies who have a great deal of data that they would like to (inaudible). \\\\nAutomotive is growing, and we\\'re delighted to see that the enterprise is growing as well. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSteven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. \\\\nAs my follow-up, maybe for Colette. On the gross margin side of things, you guys are guiding margins up nicely for the quarter. And just kind wondering looking further across the year, whether you have --  whether or not that the levers that you have available to you currently, if there\\'s further room for expansion, whether it is from product mix, higher ASPs, and or maybe some of the platform-related elements  such as software services? \\\\nAnd I was kind wondering, especially on the software side, how much that can continue to help the margins from a platform perspective? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thanks, Stephen. \\\\nYes, our gross margins within the quarter for Q1 did hit record levels, just due to very strong mix across our products, on the Maxwell side both from a gaming perspective, as well as what we have in enterprise for pro visualization and data center. As we look to Q2, a good review of where we also see gross margins, and those are looking at a non-GAAP at about 58%.  So, again, be a strong component of that. As the launch of Pascal will come out with high-end gaming and with datacenter, and the growth essentially across all of our platforms will help our overall gross margins. \\\\nAs we go forward, there is still continued work to do. We\\'re here to guide just one quarter out, but we do have a large TAM in front of us on many of these different markets, and the mix will certainly help us. We\\'re in the initial stages of rolling out what we have in software services, our overall systems. So I don\\'t expect it to be a material part of the overall gross margin, but it will definitely be a great value proposition for us, for what we put forth. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Deepon Nag, Macquarie. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDeepon Nag,  Macquarie Research Equities - Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks, guys, and congratulations on the great quarter. \\\\nFor Q2, can you kind of talk about how much of a contribution you expect from Pascal? And also maybe give us an update on where you think that yields are progressing right now? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks a lot, Deepon. \\\\nWe\\'re expecting a lot out of Pascal. Pascal was just announced with 1080 and 1070, and both of those products are in full production. We\\'re in production with Tesla P100. And so, all of our Pascal products that have we\\'ve already announced are in full production, so we\\'re expecting a lot. \\\\nYields are good and building these semiconductor devices are always hard, but we\\'re very good at it. And this is now -- a year behind when the first 16 nanometer finFET products went into production at TSMC. They have yields under great control. \\\\nTSMC is the world\\'s best manufacturer of semiconductors, and we work very closely with them, to make sure that we are ready for production. And we surely wouldn\\'t have announced it, if we didn\\'t have manufacturing under control. So we\\'re in great shape. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Ambrish Srivastava, BMO Capital Markets. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Gabriel calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. \\\\nI think when you recently launched a new GPU products, looks like your pricing, your MSRP appears to be higher than your prior generation. And how should we think about your ASP, and even gross margin trend as you are ramping this product for the rest of the year? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks. \\\\nThe thing that\\'s most important, is that the value is greater than ever. And one of the things that we know is games are becoming richer than ever, production value has become richer than ever. And gamers want to play these games with all of the settings maxed out. They would like to play at a very high resolution, and they want to play it at very high frame rates. \\\\nWhen I announced 1080, I was showing all of the latest, the most demanding games running at twice the resolution of a game console, at twice the frame rate of the game console, and it was barely even breathing hard. And so, I think one of the most important things is for customers of this segment, they want to buy a product that they can count on, and that they can rely on to be ready for the future generation games. And some of the most important future generation games are going to be in VR. \\\\nAnd so, the resolution is going to be even higher, the frame rate expectation is 90 hertz, and the latency has to be incredibly low, so that you feel a sense of presence. And so, I think the net of it all, is that the value proposition we deliver with 1080 and 1070 is just through the roof. And if you look at the early response on the web, and from analysts, they\\'re quite excited about the value proposition that we brought. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, CJ Muse, Evercore. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nC.J. Muse,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. \\\\nI guess, two questions around the data center. I guess, first part, how is the visibility here today? And I guess how do you see perhaps the transition from hyperscale to ramp in HPC? \\\\nAnd then, I know you guys are not like to forecast over the next couple of quarters. But looking out over the next 12 to 24 months, this part of your business has grown from 8% to 11% year over year. And curious as you look at one to two years, what do you think this could be as a percentage of your overall company? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, CJ, thanks a lot. \\\\nI think a lot -- the answer to a lot of your questions is I don\\'t know. However, there are some things I do know very well. One of the things that we do know is that high-performance computing is an essential approach for one of the most important computing models that we know today, which is machine learning and deep learning. Hyperscale datacenters all over the world is relying on this new model of computing, so that it can harvest, it could study all of the vast amounts of data that we\\'re getting to find insight for individual customers, make the perfect recommendation, predict when somebody would anticipate, would look forward to in terms of news or products or whatever it is. \\\\nAnd so, this approach of using computing is really unprecedented, and this is a new computing model, and the GPU is really ideal for it. And we have been working on this for coming up on a decade. And it explains one of the reasons why we have such a great lead in this particular aspect. \\\\nThe GPU is really the ideal processor, if you use massively parallel problems. And we\\'ve optimized our entire stack of platforms from the architecture, to the design, to the system, to the middleware, to the system software, all the way to the work that we do with developers all over the world, so that we can optimize the entire experience to deliver the best performance. \\\\nAnd so, this is something that has taken a long time to do. I have a great deal of confidence that machine learning is not a fad. I have a great deal of confidence that machine learning is going to be the future computing model for a lot of very large and complicated problems. And I think that all of the stories that you see, whether it\\'s the groundbreaking work that\\'s done at Google, and Google DeepMind on AlphaGo, to self driving cars, to the work that people are talking about, and artificial intelligence recommendation chatbots to -- boy, the list just goes on and on. \\\\nAnd I think that it goes without saying, that this new computing model in the last couple of years has really started to deliver very promising results, and I would characterize results as being superhuman results. And now they\\'re going into production. And we\\'re seeing production deployments, not just in one or two customers, but basically in every single hyperscale data center in the world, in every single country. \\\\nAnd so, I think this is a very big deal. And I don\\'t think it\\'s a short-term phenomenon, and the amount of data that we process is just going to grow. And so, that those are some of the things I do know. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Mark Lipacis, Jefferies. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hi, thanks for cycling me back in for a follow up. \\\\nSometimes  in -- when you introduce a new product, and this is broadly for technology, there\\'s kind of a hiccup as the transition happens, where the supply chain blows out the older inventory, and before the new products can ramp in, so people call that an air pocket. So I was wondering is that something that you can manage, how do you try to manage that? Did you account for it, when you think about the outlook for this quarter? Thank you. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks, Mark. \\\\nWell, part of transitions are always tricky, and we take it very seriously, and there\\'s several things that we do know. We have a great deal of visibility to the channel. And so, we know how much inventory is where, and of which kind. \\\\nAnd secondarily, we have perfect visibility into our supply chain, and both of those matters, we\\'ve taken into account, when we launch a new product. And so, anything could happen. The fact of the matter is we are in a high tech business, and high tech is hard. The work that we do is hard. \\\\nThe team is -- doesn\\'t take it for granted and we\\'re not complacent about our work. And so, I think that I can\\'t imagine a better team in the world that is to manage this transition. We manage transitions all the time. And so, we do not take it lightly, however, you\\'re absolutely right. I mean, it requires care, and the only thing I can tell you is that we\\'re very careful. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great, thank you. \\\\nI guess, along the same lines, can you talk a little bit about the founders edition of the new gaming products? And how does that differ from sort of previous reference designs that you\\'ve done, and is there any kind of difference in economics to NVIDIA if you sell founders edition? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The founders edition is something we did, as a result of demand from the end-user base. The founders edition is basically designed by -- a wholly designed by NVIDIA product. \\\\nA reference design is really not designed to be an end product. It\\'s really designed to be a reference for manufacturers to use as a starting point. But a founders edition is designed so that it could be manufactured, it could be marketed, and customers can continue to buy it from us, for as long as they desire. \\\\nNow our strategy -- our strategy is to support our global network of adding card partners, and we\\'re going to continue to do that. And we gave them -- we gave everybody reference designs like we did before. And, in this particular case, we created the founders edition so that people who like to buy directly from us, people who like our industrial design, and people who would like the exquisite design and quality that comes with our products that we can do. \\\\nAnd so, it\\'s designed to be extremely [over clockable]. It\\'s designed with all the best possible components. And if somebody would like to buy products directly from us, they have the ability to do that. \\\\nI expect that the vast majority of the add-in cards will continue to be manufactured by our add-in card partners, and that\\'s our expectation, and that\\'s our hope. And I don\\'t expect any dramatic change in the amount of shifting of that. So that\\'s basically it, Founders edition, the most exquisitely engineered add-in card the world has ever seen, directly from NVIDIA. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Harlan Sur, JPMorgan. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Good afternoon, and solid job on the execution. \\\\nAt the recent Analyst Day, I think articulated its exposure to developed and emerging markets and the unit and ASP growth opportunities around EM.  Just wondering, what are the current demand dynamics that you\\'re seeing in the emerging markets? Clearly, I think macro-wise, they\\'re still pretty weak, but on the flip side, gaming has shown to be fairly macro-insensitive. Would be great to get your views here. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n           Well, I think you just said it. Depending on which one of our businesses that you\\'re talking about, gaming is rather macro-insensitive for some reason. People enjoy gaming whether the economy is good or not, whether the oil price is high or not, people seem to enjoy gaming. \\\\nDon\\'t forget gaming is not something that people do once a month, like going out to a movie theater or something like that. People game every day, and the gamers that use our products are gaming every day. \\\\nIt\\'s their way of engaging with their friends, they hang out with their friends that way. It\\'s a platform for chatting. \\\\nDon\\'t forget that the number one messaging company in China, is actually a gaming company. And the reason for that is, because while people are gaming, they\\'re hanging out with their friends and they\\'re chatting with their friends. \\\\nAnd so, it is really a medium for all kinds of things, whether it\\'s entertaining, or hanging out, or expressing your artistic capabilities or whatnot. And so, gaming for one, appears to be doing quite well, in all aspects of the market. \\\\nThe second thing is, enterprise, however, is largely or hyperscale is largely a US dynamic. And the reason for that is, because a US dynamic as well as a China dynamic, because that\\'s where most of the world\\'s hyperscale companies happen to be and so. And then, automotive, most of our automotive success to date has been from the European car companies, and we\\'re seeing robust demand from the premium segments of the marketplace. \\\\nHowever, in the future we\\'re going to see a lot more success with automotive here in the United States, here in Silicon Valley, in China. We\\'re going to see a lot more global penetration because of our self-driving car platform. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Ian Ing, MKM Partners. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thank you. \\\\nSo for July, it looks like you\\'ve got some operating expense discipline. Given some hiring activity in April, you\\'re down sequentially. Is that related to the timing of some tape out activity? And as Pascal rolls out, what should the shape of tape outs be, do you think of the upcoming quarters? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, all of the Pascal chips have been taped out.  And so -- but we still have a lot of engineering work to do. The difference -- differences are minor. We\\'re a large company, and we have a lot of things that we\\'re doing. \\\\nI wouldn\\'t over-study the small deltas in  OpEx. We don\\'t manage things a dollar at a time, and we\\'re trying to invest in the important things. \\\\nOn the other hand, this Company is really good about not wasting money. And so, we want to make sure that, on the one hand, we invest into opportunities that are very important to our company, but we just have a culture of frugality that permeates our company. \\\\nAnd then lastly, from an operational perspective, we unified everything in our company behind one architecture. And whether you\\'re talking about the cloud or workstations, or datacenters, or PCs, or cars, or embedded systems, or autonomous machines, you name it, everything is exactly one architecture. And the benefit of one architecture is that we can leverage one common stack of software, and that -- a base software, it really streamlines our execution. \\\\nAnd so, it\\'s an incredibly efficient approach for leveraging our one architecture into multiple markets. And so, those three aspects of how we run the company really helps. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Blayne Curtis, Barclays. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Curtis,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question,  and nice results. \\\\nI was just curious, two questions. Jen-Hsun, you talked about the ramp of deep learning, and you talked about that you are going to use GPUs for both learning, as well as applying the inferences. Just curious, what stages, you mentioned all these consumers, what stages are all these customers? Are they actually deploying it in volume, or are they still more of sales for learning? \\\\nAnd then, you said all segments up. Just curious, OEM is finally hitting some easy compares. Is that also going to be up year over year? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think this question I should -- \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think OEM business, will that be up year over year? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the OEM business is down year over year, isn\\'t it? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Right. And so, on Q2 we\\'ll probably follow along in Q2, along with the overall PC demand, which is not expected to grow. So we\\'ll look at that as our side product, and probably would not be a growth business in Q2. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Blayne, you know that our OEM business is a declining part of our company\\'s overall business.  And not to mention that the margins are also significantly low on the corporate average. And so, I would suggest that it\\'s just increasingly a less important part of the way that we go to market. Now what I don\\'t mean by that, is that we don\\'t partner with the world\\'s large OEMs, HP, Dell, IBM, Cisco, Lenovo, all of the world large enterprise companies are our partners. \\\\nWe partner with them to take our platforms, our differentiated platforms, or specialty platforms to the world\\'s market, and most of them are related to enterprise. We just do less and less volume, high-volume components devices. Generic devices like cell phones that we got out of, generic PCs that we\\'ve gotten out of. Largely we tend not to do business like that anymore. We tend to focus on our differentiated platforms. \\\\nNow you mentioned some, you mentioned learning and training and inferencing. First of all, training is production. You can\\'t train a network just once, you have to train your network all the time. And every single hyperscale company in the world is in the process of scaling out their training. Because the networks are getting bigger, they want their networks to do even better. The difference between a 95% accurate network, and a 98% accurate network, or a 99% accurate network could mean billions of dollars of differences to internet companies. \\\\nAnd so, this is a very big deal. And so, they want their networks to be larger, they want to deploy their networks across more applications, and they want to train their network with new data all the time. And so, training is a production matter. It is probably the largest HPC, high-performance computing application on the planet that we know of at the moment. And so, we\\'re scaling, we\\'re ramping up training for production for hyperscale companies. \\\\nOn the other hand, I really appreciate you asking about the inferencing We, recently -- well, this year, several months ago we announced the Tesla M4 that was designed for inferencing. And it\\'s a little tiny graphics card, a little tiny processor, and it\\'s less than 50 watts. It\\'s called the M4. And at GTC, I announced a brand-new compiler called the GPU inference engine, GIE. \\\\nAnd GIE recompiles the network that was trained, so that it can be optimumly inferenced at the lowest possible energy. And so, not only are we already 50 watts, which is low power, we can also now inference at a higher energy efficiency, than any processor that we know today, better than any CPU by a very long shot, better than any FPGA. And so, now hyperscale companies could use our GPUs for both training, and use exactly the same architecture for inferencing, and the energy efficiency is really fantastic. \\\\nNow the benefit of using GPU for inferencing, is that you\\'re not just trying to inference only. You\\'re trying to, often times, decode the image, or you could be decoding the video, you inference on it. And you might even want to use it for transcoding, which is to re-encode that video, and stream it to whoever it is, that is -- that wants to share live video with. \\\\nAnd so the [proxy] that you want to do on the images and the video and the data, is more than just inferencing, and the benefit of our GPU is that it\\'s really great for all the other stuff too. And so, we\\'re seeing a lot of success in M4. I expect M4 to be quite a successful product, and hyperscale datacenters, my expectation will start to ramp that into production Q2, Q3, Q4 time frame. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. \\\\nOn the automotive side, I just wondered, Colette, in your CFO commentary, you mentioned by product development contracts as part of the reason it was increasing. Can you give us a little bit of an indication what those are? And is the percentage of revenue coming from those increasing? And then maybe finally, is that activity indicative of future growth in any way, that can be meaningful for us to track? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, thanks for the question. \\\\nSo in our automotive business, there\\'s definitely a process even before we\\'re shipping platforms into the overall cars, that we\\'re working jointly with the auto manufacturers, start ups and others on what may be a future product. Many of those agreements continue, and will likely continue going forward, and that is what you see incorporated in our automotive business. So, yes, you probably will see this continue, and go forward. \\\\nIt is not necessarily consistent, it\\'s starts in some quarters, are bigger in other quarters. But that\\'s what is incorporated in our automotive. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And Colette, let me just add one thing. \\\\nThe thing to remember is that we\\'re not selling chips into a car. We\\'re not selling -- you know that DRIVE PX is the world\\'s first autonomous driving car computer that\\'s powered by AI, it\\'s powered by deep learning, and we\\'re seeing a lot of success with DRIVE PX. And as Colette mentioned earlier, there\\'s some 80 companies that we\\'re working with, whether it\\'s tier 1s, or OEMs, or start-up companies all over the world that we\\'re working with, in this area of autonomous vehicles. \\\\nAnd the thing to realize is, you\\'re not selling a chip into that car. You\\'re working with a car company to build an autonomous driving car. And so that process requires a fair amount of engineering. And so, we have a mechanism, we have a development mechanism that allows car companies to work with our engineers to collaborate, to develop these self-driving cars. And that\\'s most of that stuff that Colette was talking about. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Craig Ellis, B Riley & Company. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Ellis,  B. Riley & Company - Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the revenue and the margin performance. \\\\nJen-Hsun, I wanted to follow up on one of the comments that you made regarding Pascal. I think you indicated that all Pascal parts had taped out. So the question is, if that is the case, will we see refresh activity across all of the platform groups in FY17, or in fact will some of the refresh activity taking place FY18? So what\\'s the duration of the refresh that we are looking at? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well first, let\\'s -- thanks for the question, and we don\\'t comment on unannounced products as you know. \\\\nI hate to ruin all of the surprises for you, but Pascal is the single most ambitious GPU architecture we have ever undertaken. And this is really the first GPU that was designed from the ground up, for applications that are quite well beyond computer graphics and high-performance computing. It was designed to take into consideration, all of the things that we\\'ve learned about deep learning, all of the things that we\\'ve learned about VR. \\\\nFor example, it has a brand-new graphics pipeline that allows Pascal to simultaneously project into multiple surfaces at the same time, with no performance penalty, that otherwise, it would degrade your performance in VR by factor by a factor of 2,  just because you have two surfaces you\\'re projecting into. And then, we can do all kinds of amazing things for augmented reality, other types of virtual reality displays, surround displays, curved displays, domed displays, I mean there\\'s all kind of -- holographic displays, all kind of display that are being invented at the moment. And we have the ability to now support those type of displays, with a much more elegant architecture, without degrading performance. \\\\nAnd so, Pascal is, whether it\\'s AI, whether it\\'s gaming, whether it\\'s VR, is really the most ambitious project we have ever undertaken, and it\\'s going to go through all of our markets. The application for self-driving cars is going to be pretty exciting. And so, it\\'s going to go through all of our market. And so, we are in -- of course, we have plenty to announce in the future, but we\\'ve announced what we announced. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Romit Shaw, Nomura Research. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRomit Shah,  Nomura Research - Analyst    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks very much. \\\\nJen-Hsun, I was hoping you could just share your view today on fully autonomous driving, because your mobilized chairman has said very recently, that the technology basically isn\\'t ready. And that fully autonomous cars won\\'t be available until -- I think he was saying 2019. And I guess, my question is well, one, I\\'d love your view on that? And two, whether the cars are fully autonomous, or autonomous in certain environments say, one or two years out, does it impact the trajectory of your automotive business? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First of all, to -- working on full autonomy is a great endeavor. And whether we get there 100%, 90%, 92%, 93%, is in my mind completely irrelevant. The endeavor of getting there, and making your car more and more autonomous -- initially, of course, we would like to have a virtual copilot. \\\\nHaving a virtual copilot is the way I get to work every day. I mean, every single day I drive my Model S. And every single day I put it into autonomous mode, and every single day it brings me joy. And I\\'m not confessing necessarily, texting a little bit is okay. \\\\nAnd so, I think that the path to full autonomy is going to be paved by amazing capabilities along the way. And so, we\\'re not waiting around for 2019, we\\'ll ship autonomous vehicles by the end of this year. And so I understand that we\\'re three years ahead of other people\\'s schedules. \\\\nHowever, we also know that DRIVE PX 2 is the most advanced autonomous computing car computer in the world today. And it\\'s powered by AI fully. And DRIVE PX 2 will be a DRIVE PX 3, there will be a DRIVE PX 4. And then by 2019, I guess, we\\'ll be shipping DRIVE PX 5. \\\\nAnd so, those -- our road map just like that. That\\'s how we work, as you guys know very well. And so, I think there\\'s a point, there \\'s a lot of work to be done, which is the exciting part. The thing about a technology company, a thing about any company, unless there\\'s great problems and great challenges that we can help solve, what value do we bring? \\\\nAnd what NVIDIA does for a living, is to do what--  to build computers that no other company in the world can build, whether it\\'s high-performance computers that are used to power a nation\\'s supercomputers, or a deep learning supercomputer so that we can gain insight from data, or self-driving car computers, so that autonomous cars can save people\\'s lives, and make people\\'s lives more convenient. \\\\nThat\\'s what we do. This is the work that we do. And I am delighted here, that we\\'re three years ahead of the competition. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, Suji Desilva, Topeka Capital Markets. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSuji Desilva,  Topeka Capital Markets - Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hi, Jen-Hsun, hi, Colette. Congratulations on the impressive results here. \\\\nOn the data center business, is there an inflection going on, with deep learning, with the software maturity that\\'s driving some at this point? And can you give us any metrics. Jen-Hsun, for how to think about the size of this opportunity before you? And I know it\\'s hard, but things like server attach rates, what percent of servers you could attach? Will it be an M4 in an high end in every box? Or was it -- or maybe the number of GPUs a single deep learning implementation has?  Something like that.  That would help. Thanks. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, the truth is that nobody really knows how big, this deep learning market is going to be. Until a couple of two or three years ago, it was really even hard to imagine how good the results were going to be. \\\\nAnd if it wasn\\'t because the groundbreaking work that was done at Google and Facebook, and in other researchers around the world, how would we have discovered, that it was going to be superhuman? The work that recently was done by Microsoft Research. They\\'ve achieved superhuman levels of inferencing that -- of image recognition and voice recognition that\\'s really kind of hard to imagine. And these networks are now huge \\\\nThe Microsoft Research network, super deep network is 1,000 layers deep. And so, training such a network is quite a chore, it\\'s quite endeavor, and this is a problem that high-performance computing will have to deployed, and this is why our GPUs so sought after. \\\\nIn terms of how big that\\'s going to be, my sense is that almost no transaction -- my sense is that almost no transaction with the internet will be without deep learning, or some machine learning inference in the future. I just can\\'t imagine that. \\\\nThere\\'s no recommendation of a movie, no recommendation of a purchase, no search, no image search, no text that won\\'t somehow had passed through some smart chatbot, or smartbot, or some machine learning algorithms, so that they could make the transaction more -- make the inference, or more request, more useful to you. And so, I think this is going to be a very big thing. \\\\nAnd then, on the other hand, the enterprises, we use deep learning all over our Company today. And we\\'re not -- we had the benefit of being early, because we saw the power of this technology early on. But we are seeing deep learning being used now in medical imaging all over the world. We\\'re seeing it being used in manufacturing, it\\'s going to be used for scientific computing. \\\\nMore data is generated by high-performance computers and supercomputers than just about anything. They generate it through simulation. They generate so much data, that they to throw the vast majority of it away. For example, Hadron Collider, whenever the protons collide, they throw away 99% of the data, and they\\'re barely able to keep up with just that 1%. \\\\nAnd so, by using machine learning, and our GPUs, they could find insight in the rest of the 99%. And so, there\\'s just -- applications go on and on and on. And people are now starting to understand this deep learning. It really puts machine learning and puts artificial intelligence in the hands of engineers, is understandable. And that\\'s one of the reasons why it\\'s growing so fast. \\\\nAnd so, I don\\'t know exactly how big it\\'s going to be. But here\\'s my proposition, and this is going to be the next big computing model, the way that people compute. That in the past, software programmers wrote programs, compiled it. And in the future, we\\'re going to have algorithms write the software for us. \\\\nAnd so, that\\'s a [very good way of computing] and I think it\\'s a very good deal. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Next question, David Wong, Wells Fargo. \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks very much. \\\\nIn automotive, what product are your revenues coming from currently? Is DRIVE PX at all significant, or are your sales primarily DRIVE CX, or something else? \\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The primary parts of our automotive business today comes from infotainment, in the premier infotainment systems. For example, the virtual cockpit that Audi ships. And the vast majority of our development projects today come from DRIVE [PX] on those projects. \\\\nWe probably have 10 times as many autonomous driving projects, as we have infotainment projects today.

Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all of those listening in today. First quarter revenue increased 18% from a year ago to $984 million based on growth across both of our business segments. Gross margin also improved, driven largely by the success of our recently launched Ryzen CPUs. I am pleased with our first quarter product execution and improved year-over-year financial results, which demonstrate the revenue growth and gross margin expansion potential with our strong set of new products. \\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment. We delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth. Strong demand for Ryzen CPUs and improved GPU sales resulted in CG revenue increasing 29% from the year-ago period. CG revenue declined 1% sequentially, which was better-than-normal seasonality as significant growth in desktop processor sales, driven by the first month of Ryzen CPU sales, largely offset seasonal declines in GPU and notebook APU sales. \\\\nSolid demand for our family of premium Ryzen 7 processors, including our flagship Ryzen 7 1800X offering, which is the industry\\'s highest performance 8-core CPU, drove our highest desktop processor revenue in more than 2 years. Ryzen CPUs have been consistently ranked among the top-selling processors at global e-tailers and retailers. And press reviews and end-user sentiment have highlighted the strong performance and value proposition. \\\\nIn early April, we launched our enthusiast-class Ryzen 5 processors and received overwhelmingly positive reviews that demonstrate our multi-threaded leadership and unmatched value proposition. \\\\nThe Ryzen CPU partner ecosystem also continues to strengthen. We have seated more than 300 software developers to support their work optimizing for Ryzen CPUs and have already seen double-digit performance gains across a number of top-tier gaming titles. Last week, the first Ryzen-based OEM gaming desktops were announced, and we continue the rapid rollout of Ryzen-powered systems with additional launches planned for major OEMs later this quarter. \\\\nIn Graphics, GPU sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago based on growth across all of our product lines. The ramp of Polaris-based notebook design wins drove increased mobile GPU sales while our desktop growth was led by improved channel sales. \\\\nIn early Q2, we launched 4 new Radeon RX 500 GPUs, featuring our Polaris architecture that deliver improved performance. These new mainstream GPUs provide a compelling solution for the millions of gamers looking to upgrade their PCs to support advanced display technologies and deliver optimal gaming experiences. \\\\nWe also saw higher professional graphics revenue from a year ago, driven by expanding channel sales and growing data center wins, as we continue to increase our GPU-compute footprint with leading cloud service providers. \\\\nWe remain on track to launch the first products from our next-generation Radeon Vega family later this quarter. Vega is a forward-looking architecture that combines a revolutionary memory subsystem, next-generation compute engine, advanced pixel engine and new geometry pipeline to dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency for the next generation of GPU workloads. Customer excitement is building as we focus on bringing significant competition to the high-end GPU space across the PC gaming, professional design and GPU compute markets. \\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 5% from a year ago, driven by the latest game console offerings from Sony and Microsoft and our third straight quarter delivering year-on-year embedded revenue growth. We see solid demand for our latest FinFET-based semi-custom offerings in 2017, including the planned holiday launch of Microsoft\\'s 4K-focused Project Scorpio console featuring a new AMD SoC. \\\\nOn the data center front, in March, we demonstrated that our upcoming Naples server CPU would offer more cores, I/O and memory bandwidth when compared to the highest-end dual socket x86 server CPUs currently available, resulting in better performance across multiple workloads. \\\\nNaples platform development work continued to accelerate in the quarter. We are in the final stages of preparation in advance of launch and are very pleased with the status of our silicon and customer engagements. We have now seated thousands of Naples processors across an extensive set of OEMs, end users and partners, and remain on track for our first Naples products to launch this quarter. \\\\nIn closing, we started 2017 delivering significant year-on-year revenue growth and margin expansion based on solid product execution and strong market and customer reception to our new leadership products. Our focus in 2017 remains on launching our Naples server CPU with broad customer, partner and ecosystem support. Naples is the first step in our long-term plan to deliver a leadership data center product road map. \\\\nComplementing the success of our mainstream Polaris-based GPUs with our high-end Vega GPUs, extending our Zen core into the mainstream desktop and premium notebook markets with the launches of our Ryzen 3 CPUs and Ryzen mobile APUs in the second half of the year, and expanding our participation in the fast-growing market for GPU compute with the launch of Radeon Instinct accelerators midyear. \\\\n2017 is an important year for AMD, and we are well positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion based on bringing performance, choice and innovation to an expanding set of markets. I look forward to discussing more about our long-term strategy at our Financial Analyst Day later this month. \\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a good start to 2017 as we expanded gross margin, increased revenue 18% year-over-year to $984 million and reduced losses year-over-year. \\\\nComputing and Graphics segment revenue increased 29% year-over-year, driven by the launch of our high-performance Ryzen desktop processors and our strengthened GPU product portfolio. Our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue increased 5% from a year ago. \\\\nLet me provide some specifics for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 34%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year, driven by a higher overall mix of revenue from our Computing and Graphics segment and a richer product mix within that segment, due to Ryzen desktop processor sales. \\\\nOperating expenses were $364 million compared to $332 million a year ago. The increase is due primarily to R&D investments in Graphics and our server business. Net licensing gain from our server JV with THATIC was $27 million compared to $7 million a year ago. Operating loss was $6 million in the first quarter of 2017, a significant improvement from a $55 million loss a year ago. \\\\nFirst quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $32 million, down from $41 million year-over-year, primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower debt balance. Net loss was $38 million, or loss per share of $0.04 calculated using 939 million shares of common stock as compared to a net loss of $96 million or $0.12 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $28 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of negative $22 million from a year ago. \\\\nNow turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $593 million, up 29% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher Ryzen desktop, CPU and graphics processor sales. The better-than-seasonal quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to lower mobile and graphics processor sales, largely offset by Ryzen desktop processor sales. \\\\nComputing and Graphics business segment operating loss was $15 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $70 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher revenue. \\\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $391 million, up 5% year-over-year, primarily due to higher semi-custom SoC sales. Operating income was $9 million, down from $16 million a year ago, due primarily to higher server-related R&D investments, largely offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $943 million at the end of the quarter compared to $1.26 billion at the end of 2016. The sequential decrease was driven primarily by the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments and increased inventory. \\\\nInventory ended at $839 million compared to $751 million at year-end in support of the ramp of new products and increased semi-custom SoC sales in the second quarter. \\\\nLong-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.41 billion, down from $1.44 billion at year-end, primarily due to debt reduction activities. The principal debt amount was $1.73 billion, down $34 million from the prior quarter as a result of debt reduction actions. \\\\nTurning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter. We expect revenue to increase 17% sequentially plus or minus 3%, non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 33%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $370 million, licensing gain associated with our server JV to be approximately $20 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million, and inventory to be down sequentially. \\\\nFor 2017, we now expect revenue to increase low double-digit percentage from a year-over-year basis and CapEx to be approximately $140 million, including the capitalization of production mask sets beginning in Q1 2017. Additional 2017 guidance can be found in the CFO commentary document. \\\\nIn closing, we remain focused on continuing to improve our financial performance on the strength of new product introductions, continued financial discipline and ongoing strategic investments in the business. I look forward to sharing further details on our longer-term prospects at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on May 16. \\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready to begin the Q&A portion of our call.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Principal and Senior Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I wonder if you could spend a little bit more time talking about the Ryzen desktop launch, how you would characterize that it\\'s gone so far? Maybe any kind of quantification you can give on revenue for the 1 month you had in the first quarter and then for the second quarter guidance? And then anything that might have limited sales in the quarter. We heard things about, shortages of motherboards from the SKU suppliers, et cetera. So any kind of additional commentary around the Ryzen launch would be really helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, absolutely, Matt. So, look, we\\'re very pleased with how the Ryzen launch well -- went. It was a big launch for us. We did Ryzen 7 first in early March and then Ryzen 5 here in the middle of April. All of the feedback that we\\'ve gotten so far from both our customers and from end users has been very strong. I think the value proposition is very strong at both the Ryzen 7 8-core devices as well as the Ryzen 5 4- and 6-core devices. Relative to how it performed in the quarter, actually it performed as we expected. So with the global launch, we were reaching many distributors and many channel partners, and I think that\\'s going well. We did see some early shortages in terms of motherboards, and that was our motherboard partners ramping their supply in line with our CPU supply. But that was really dissipated after the first couple of weeks. So nothing out of the ordinary there. So we feel really good about where it is. I think the important thing is as we go into the second quarter, we not only have the channel sales, but we also have the major OEMs that will be launching their systems in the second quarter. So I think that\\'s the next piece of the Ryzen launch for us. But overall, I would say it went quite well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Principal and Senior Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And just as my follow-up question, wanted to ask a little bit about gross margin. Lisa, you talked in your prepared remarks about as the new product roll out across the different parts of the company through the year that margins should expand. Yet your -- with a full quarter of Ryzen, you\\'re guiding gross margin down slightly sequentially. I know the new gaming console business starts to ramp for the upcoming season in that quarter as well. So any kind of puts and takes around that gross margin? Because for some reaction I got from investors tonight that sequentially down gross margin surprised a couple of folks. So any clarification there would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Absolutely, Matt. So if you look at our gross margin progression, given the mix of our business, clearly we made actually very nice progress year-over-year. So if you look at Q1 2017 compared to Q1 2016, we expanded margin by 2 points and that was really on the strength of Ryzen. When you look sequentially, because of the mix of our business, game consoles were at the lowest point in the first quarter, and there will be a ramp of game consoles going into the second quarter. So the relative mix of the business sees more game consoles in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. So that\\'s the reason for the sequential guidance. But again, if you look year-on-year, Q2 \\'17 to Q2 \\'16, you see again a nice margin expansion as a result of the strength of the products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Wanted to follow up on the Ryzen launch, not only in the quarter, but also in the guide, and specifically, any color you could provide on the channel inventory, how that exited the quarter and what your plans are for adding or boiling down some of that inventory in Q2?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, So, sure, Ross. So as we go into the second quarter, we certainly are adding both the Ryzen 5 in addition to the Ryzen 7. So if we look at the forward guidance, up 17% quarter-on-quarter, that is driven by additional Ryzen as well as the semi-custom ramp that I just talked about. We are early in the ramp. Everything that we see is -- we\\'re getting a positive reception throughout the ecosystem and we\\'re going to continue with go-to-market activities and, as I mentioned, the OEM components of that will kick in, in the second quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And I guess as my follow-up, 2 quick ones for Devinder. The inventory went up sequentially by about 11%, 12%. And you had an explanation for that, but if I recall right, you thought it\\'d be flat. So I\\'m just wondering what changed there? And then with the share count, I think as you approach breakeven, the share count might change. So any color you could give us on the share count going forward would be helpful as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Why sure. And you\\'re right about the inventory. The ramp of new products and especially the ramp of the semi-custom product revenue that Lisa just talked about was the main reason for the high inventory. We also had the opportunity in the quarter to put [those wafers] in Q1 ahead of Q2 sales and took advantage of the opportunity leading to the inventory at the $839 million. On the share count, you\\'re right. As we go ahead and look at the share count on a basic share basis, we have 939 million, but there are 2 parts to it. If we were profitable, the warrants that we issued to Mubadala last year as part of the WSA, those get converted depending on the stock price, and that would be in there depending on profitability. And then the second thing is a convertible, obviously, as you know, how that works, is, if converted, then obviously those will be included in the share count, otherwise it will depend upon dilution or not, depending on the EPS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Perhaps a question for Lisa and one for Devinder. Lisa, can you talk about whether or not you\\'re getting the right capacity and expected yields from your foundry as Ryzen launches? And for Devinder, as your customers take higher ASP processors in the game console business, I seem to remember when you originally launched, I thought that the -- maybe the initial yields or maybe the initial margins were not as good but the margins improved over time. And I\\'m wondering if, assuming I remembered properly, if that\\'s something also we should be thinking about as your customers take the higher ASP game console processors?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Mark. So on your first question, relative to the margins and how those look, I think they are -- the yields are as expected, so both the 16-nanometer and the 14-nanometer have done really well. And so in terms of the new product ramp, the yields are as expected and per our margin structure.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, on the semi-custom, Mark, as far as the margins are concerned, you are referring to the operating margins, I think we\\'re pretty pleased where we are. And it\\'s a mix for us in terms of transition to some of the products, for example, the Sony PlayStation Pro that we launched sometime last year and obviously, the older game console that we launched in 2013. The ASPs do come down over time, although we are able to manage the cost down, too, and therefore, offsetting the ASP decline.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, and, Mark, maybe just to finish off the comment. I think -- to your question, I think we feel pretty good about our cost structure. We\\'re always going to continue to try to reduce the cost structure over time. But in terms of the margin expansion story as we go through the year, it\\'s going to be about the mix of business. And as we get into the higher ASP, stronger product portfolio and that ramps to a larger piece of the business, that will be the margin expansion story.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid M. Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Can you give us some idea of where Vega sits? Does it focus on the price points above Polaris? Or does it provide a refresh also within the lower price points where currently you have Polaris?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, absolutely, David. So Vega is really a new architecture, so it is focused on the price point above Polaris. We expect Vega to be a broad product for us that will go across the gaming segment, the professional workstation segment as well as GPUs in the data center, and we will be launching products across all of those segments with the Vega architecture in the next couple of months. So the Polaris refresh for us is the RX 500 series that we launched just a couple weeks ago. And that is what we would use in sort of those mainstream price points in 2017.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid M. Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And could you give us any specifics on when in the second half you expect to launch notebook and desktop processors [within cores] and integrated graphics?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so we are on track to launch the rest of the Ryzen portfolio in PCs. We\\'ll launched Ryzen 3 sort of earlier in the second half, and then we will launch our Ryzen mobile towards the holiday cycle for the second half.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          For the first one, I\\'m a little surprised on the [CSG] business, you said -- I mean, sales were roughly flat, sequentially, give or take. You said Ryzen sales made up for seasonally lower GPUs in notebooks we have -- should have materially lower margins. I\\'m just amazed -- I\\'m just very surprised that the loss in the business barely got any better. Can you give us some indication for where Ryzen margins are today versus the product that they\\'re replacing? And give us a little bit of color on why the CPU margins didn\\'t actually get much better just given the ramp?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Stacy, maybe let me start and see if Devinder has some comments to add. I think certainly the rise in gross margins are substantially better than the legacy portfolio. So I think that is true. I think when you look at the sequential, there was 1% sequential decline, and there was a $7 million or $8 million sequential improvement in operating loss. There was also some additional R&D in that segment as we\\'re ramping up both product expenses as well as some sales and marketing and go-to-market expenses in the quarter. Yes, so overall, it was as we expected. Maybe, Devinder, do you want to add to that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I think the other thing I would add, Stacy, is on the Ryzen piece of it. The ASPs are better, the margins are better. And as you can see from a segment standpoint, we made some pretty good progress year-over-year from a viewpoint of the operating loss getting better or the results getting better year-over-year from a segment standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. For my follow-up, I guess maybe it hints at the OpEx a little bit, but it looks like you\\'re capitalizing your masks now. You took your CapEx side up by $60 million for the year. You went from $80 million to $140 million. Is that all the mask? And if so, were those mask costs actually in OpEx before? And if that\\'s the case, have you actually taken your OpEx guide effectively up by $60 million for the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think, 2 parts to it. First of all, on the mask piece, okay, you\\'re right. The mask costs, as our product development becomes profitable, I think the mass costs have gone up. Especially with the latest technology, we went ahead and decided to capitalize the production mask set cost. From a geographic standpoint, the mask costs, but as they would have been an R&D previously, would be sitting in the COGS side of the P&L, and therefore, amortized in the COGS side related to the production of the unit. And the difference in the CapEx guidance, $80 million to $100 million, and $40 million is primarily the max costs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. So what does that mean for, I guess, how you guys are tackling gross margin now if they would have been directly in the COGS before, and now they\\'re being capitalized over time? Is that a margin -- I guess, effective margin boost even though it\\'s not anything on the cash side? And if so, I guess, the same question then, why are margins down this quarter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, I think margins, as Lisa said earlier, year-on-year, we\\'re pretty pleased with the progress, 2 percentage points up. Q2 is a mix of the business, and then as we get to the end of -- to the second of the year, we\\'ll see the full impact of, not just the Ryzen product, but also both Naples product that\\'s coming up at the tail end of Q2, and then maybe into the second half of 2017.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Stacy, maybe I just want to clarify because I want to make sure that we were clear. So the masks were in OpEx and now they\\'re going to be capitalized as they go into production. So they weren\\'t in COGS before.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So you have effectively taken your OpEx up then, because it doesn\\'t look like your OpEx is coming down by the same amount. So you\\'re spending more?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I think it really is a full year statement, and I think it\\'s a recognition of, as we transition from 14-nanometer to 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer masks are substantially more expensive than 14-nanometer. So I don\\'t think you can exactly put it the way you put it. But I think -- overall, I think what we\\'re trying to do is basically, as the masks sets becomes more sizable on the production level to capitalize them.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research and Senior Research Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I actually wanted to just continue with the discussion on margins. So would the margin profile then as we exit the year, should we expect margins -- gross margins to trend up for the second half versus what you reported, i.e., or what you\\'re guiding to, i.e., would that be the lowest point for the year? And then I have a follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Ambrish, I think you should expect that we will expand margins as we go through the year. We do have this mix effect between semi-custom and new product revenue. But certainly, our exit velocity as we ended the year, we should see -- when you compare year-on-year sort of Q4 \\'17 to Q4 \\'16, you should see the margin expansion.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research and Senior Research Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, and then for my follow-up, in your full year guide, on the top line, now you\\'re giving a -- you\\'re quantifying it versus what you had before. I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity or to the extent you guys can share on the assumptions that you have baked in there for the various segments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so the full year guide is low double-digit revenue growth, \\'17 to \\'16. I think, given our product portfolio being very much influenced by the PC -- the Ryzen in PCs, Vega for GPUs as well as Naples from a server standpoint, we expect that the Computing and Graphics segment will be -- will grow more so than the EESC segment overall on a year-over-year basis, just given some of the consumer markets move faster than some of the data center and server markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, can you give us a sense of the introduction of Naples into the second half and next year? Is that going to reflect or be similar to what you\\'re doing with the Ryzen 7 and then 5 and then 3? And I have a follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So look, we\\'re really pleased with where we are with the Naples program right now. Overall, from a performance standpoint of the product and the customer engagements, it\\'s going as we would expect. We will launch here in the second quarter. So we\\'ll start some low-volume of revenue shipments here in the second quarter that will ramp gradually into the second half of the year. And so overall, I think that is how the server outlook will be. I think I have said before, and I did still say, that the server market has a longer design win to revenue conversion cycle. And so we would expect it to take a couple quarters for us to ramp the Naples product over time. And you should see a number of customers announcing with AMD platforms over the next couple quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And then as a follow-up on the server side, what\\'s the strategy in terms of positioning of the product? I mean, traditionally, in most cases, it\\'s been more of, like, a me-too product at the low end of the market. What\\'s the strategy here? If you can share that with us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we believe we\\'re highly differentiated with Naples in the sense that we have more cores, we have more memory bandwidth, we have more I/O than our competition. So for certain workloads, I think Naples is going to do very, very well, certainly, in the cloud as well as in certain HPC workloads and big data workloads that can use all of that memory and I/O bandwidth. We will be talking more about the positioning of Naples and the key workloads as we go through the next couple of months prior to launch. But certainly, we feel that it\\'s, again, like Ryzen, on the strength of the Zen core, we have a very, very strong foundational product. And now it\\'s about making sure that we help our customers get to market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist, Global Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor/Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, guys, can you hear me?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, John.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist, Global Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor/Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, can you hear me?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, go ahead.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist, Global Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor/Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Just quickly, Lisa, given that mix is now becoming quite important in trying to understand gross margin, I\\'d be kind of curious, what percent of your compute business in the March quarter was based on Ryzen? And I guess, if you assume that all of it transitions to Ryzen eventually, had that occurred in the March quarter, can you give us an understanding of how much better gross margins would have been? And then I have a follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right, John, that might be hard for me to answer very specifically. But let me give you the high-level view. So, look, we started selling Ryzen on March 2, and a good piece of it was basically for us positioning into the distributors. We take revenue on a sellout model, and so you should think about -- although we shipped a number of Ryzens, we didn\\'t necessarily revenue them all in the quarter, just given that we\\'re on a sellout model for our revenue recognition. In terms of where we are in the transition, Ryzen, non-Ryzen, we still have a long ways to go. I mean, the way you should think about it is Ryzen 7 was at the very high end. We\\'re going to -- Ryzen 5 has started, we have Ryzen 3 that will come next and then we have the entire mobile portfolio as well. So it will take us through this year to really transition the majority of the product over to Ryzen. I think everything that we\\'ve seen, the ASP uplifts are definitely very beneficial. And so we\\'re pleased with sort of the pricing that we\\'re commanding for the product and the reception for the product. So I think it\\'s just that it will take us a couple quarters to transition the overall portfolio over to Ryzen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist, Global Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor/Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, Lisa, as a follow-up to that, I know you guys are coming up with an Analyst Day next month and some of these targets might change. But to the extent that your old gross margin target was sort of 36% to 40%, I\\'m just kind of curious to what extent can you get to that sort of 38% midpoint just by moving your current market share mix towards Ryzen? And to what extent does getting to 38% or above imply either market share gains in the compute business on the desktop notebook side or on the server side? How do I think about that dynamic?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So the long-term guidance at 36% to 40%, I think we have multiple ways of getting there. Certainly, on the PC side, it is not anticipating that we gain a significant amount of share over our historical numbers. So I think the idea on the PC side is, again, I think 2017, a large percentage of the margin story is around PCs. I think as you go into 2018, you\\'ll see a larger percentage of that be in servers. But to the fundamental question, I think we feel good that the mix dynamics are there, the product is strong enough to command the right ASPs that we can get to the long-term margin target several different ways.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, for my first one, back to Ryzen. When I look at your Q2 outlook, it\\'s going up about $170 million or so sequentially. And when I look at the last few years, generally Q1 to Q2, just the console side, has gone up over $100 million or so. So is it fair to assume that Ryzen perhaps is contributing something in that $50 million, $60 million, $70 million? And if that is the case, how does that compare to your original expectations? Did they change throughout the quarter because of whatever pricing action [people] might have taken? Just that this $50 million, $60 million, $70 million, if this is right, is this a run rate number for Ryzen? Or how should we put this in the context of what Ryzen can be as it becomes a bigger part of your portfolio?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So without commenting on the exact numbers between semi-custom and Ryzen, I think it\\'s fair to say that the semi-custom business will have a reasonable ramp in the second quarter as will Ryzen. In terms of relative to our expectations, it\\'s actually very close to our expectations of what we expected the ramp rate to be as we\\'re going into this new segment. As I think I mentioned on one of the previous questions, we don\\'t expect to be at peak run rate in the second quarter. I think we will be continuing to ramp Zen-based product in the PC business throughout the year as we bring more and more SKUs online. And so I think the second quarter is -- will certainly be higher than the first quarter, and I would expect the second half to be higher than what we\\'re seeing in the second quarter, as we ramp more and more SKUs, as more OEM platforms come online. As you guys know, the PC business is -- it tends to be a very back-half loaded business. So as we get into back to school, the retail segments and holiday, you would expect that both channel and OEM PC sales to benefit from the stronger product portfolio.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And as my follow-up, how do you feel about the PC gaming market for this year? I know just near term, there have been some concerns about excess-GPU inventory in China. Have you -- are those concerns based on fact? Or are they just perception? And have you seen anything abnormal in the demand or supply for PC-GPU product, in any region or any customer segment?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, on the GPU side, we actually haven\\'t seen anything abnormal. We normally see the seasonality going from the Q4 to Q1, that sales go down. We saw something very normal to that. From an inventory standpoint, we think it\\'s normal to maybe even slightly lean because we were going through a transition from our 400 series to 500 series. So we see the gaming segment as healthy.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And any comment for the full year? Last year -- last, actually, couple of years have been quite strong in PC gaming. I know you probably may not quantify it, but just how do you feel about the overall PC gaming market? Do you think the trend persists in terms of both unit and pricing expansion this year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. From what we see, I think we feel good about the gaming segment overall. Graphics continues to be a strong segment. For, us it\\'s not just a channel business, but it\\'s the ramp of our OEM business. So we have a number of new OEM systems that are also ramping here in the first half of the year. As it relates to ASPs, we are excited with the launch of Vega that will see a significant improvement in our ASPs, just given our current presence in the high-end segment of the GPU market. So yes, overall, I think we feel good about the market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Actually 2 related ones. Just wanted to go back to the OpEx in terms of, not only is it up sequentially but then you\\'re getting extra from the move of the mask sets. Can you just talk about where that OpEx dollars are going? And if it\\'s, in fact, servers, can you just talk about the spend required to get at the market? And then just I wanted to clarify on the expense, it should hit gross margin, but can you just talk about 7-nanometer as a whole and timing as those would come through? Is it a back -- is the CapEx back-end loaded when you\\'re doing the $140 million? And then just talk about the impact to the gross margin with the higher 7-nanometer spend now hitting gross margin.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Maybe let me start on the OpEx and then have Devinder comment on the second piece of the question. So on the OpEx, we are making targeted investments in several different areas. The key areas are in GPUs and server. And it\\'s both on the R&D side as well as on some go to market. So from our standpoint, these are very strong products. We want to make sure that we have enough customer resources to help our customers ramp into production. So I think they\\'re targeted investments, but as we\\'ve been in the past, we\\'ll be very prudent with where the OpEx goes. And then relative to the...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think the CapEx, you asked about the front end -- back end. I think it\\'s pretty balanced. Maybe it\\'s about $40 million, $60 million, first half, second half to $140 million, but it\\'s pretty balanced.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Then just in terms of the impact to the gross margin as the mask sets roll through?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          They\\'re all contemplated. I think we\\'ve had a lot of discussion on the gross margin improvement year-over-year and sequentially. And Lisa has referenced about improving gross margins as we go through the year and the move of the other expenses from the OpEx side related to the mask costs capitalization to the COGS side of it, which impacts gross margin, is all contemplated in that gross margin improvement.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wonder if you could talk about what the CPU mix looks like over the course of the year. And you\\'ve talked a lot about the Ryzen ramp, but what\\'s happening to the older products? Do you see a long tail on that? Or is there a coexistence between the 2 product portfolios? Or are you sort of rotating everything to Ryzen on a faster basis?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So, Joe, the way to think about that is for the Ryzen 7 and a good portion of the Ryzen 5, we really didn\\'t have a competing product in that segment, so it\\'s really additive. I mean, we\\'ve actually added [SAM] to our CPU market coverage. The legacy products will continue in the market. They would certainly continue through this year, and that\\'s all contemplated in the model. So we feel that they\\'re very complementary products. And different geographies move at different rates. We have still a significant installed base of motherboards out there from our previous generation, so we\\'ll keep supporting both products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. That\\'s helpful. And then as you\\'ve talked about getting better Ryzen penetration over the course of the year, how do you think about Intel\\'s new products in the back half? And you know, they\\'ve talked about sort of a 15% performance per clock improvement on their new 14-nanometer product. Is that contemplated in your guidance? And how are you thinking about the Ryzen products stacking up against that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we\\'re very pleased with where the Ryzen product is positioned now. We think, from a value proposition standpoint, performance, performance per dollar, it\\'s very strong. We obviously have -- other products are -- we\\'re going to be launching throughout the year to ensure that we have strong product positioning throughout the year. And I think the more important thing, Joe, and we\\'ll talk more about this at our Financial Analyst Day, is we have a long-term road map, whether you\\'re talking about PCs or GPUs or servers, to ensure that we continue to refresh our product plans and our product road maps over time. So I think we feel good about where we are positioned today and we\\'re going to ensure that we continue to roll out products to strengthen that positioning over time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question today is coming from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wanted to ask about the staggered launch to the major PC OEMs. Was that like just a modest supply constraint on the rollout? Or if not, then why not just launch to the enthusiast and the major PC OEM market together? And do you plan to do the same on Ryzen 5 and 3?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Chris. So there was no particular supply constraint. I think it\\'s more of the ebb and flow of the market. When you think about the channel market or the DIY market, you can basically introduce your product any time during the year. The OEMs have a very set cycle. They typically launch new products in Q2 for the back-to-school season, and so that was just the timing of when the OEM platforms were ready. And then again, when you\\'re launching so many different SKUs, I think launching Ryzen 7 first, then Ryzen 5, then Ryzen 3 was absolutely our plan to make sure that we hit all of the logistics and stuff on plan. But overall, like I said, nothing different than what we expected. I think we\\'re pleased with where -- the overall launches, and we\\'ll be rolling out many more products over the coming quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura Graves,   -     [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $3.01 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 17% sequentially.\\\\nStarting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.66 billion was down 6% year-on-year and up 26% sequentially. Results exceeded our expectations driven by strength in both desktop and notebook gaming. Our GeForce RTX lineup features the most advanced GPU for every price point and uniquely offers hardware-based ray tracing for cinematic graphics. While ray tracing launched a little more than a year ago, 2 dozen top titles have shipped with it or are on the way. Ray tracing is supported by all the major publishers, including all-star titles and franchise such as Minecraft, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Watch Dogs, Tomb Raider, Doom, Wolfenstein and Cyberpunk. Of note, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, had a record-breaking launch in late October that came on heels of CONTROL, an action-adventure game with multiple ray trace features. Reviews have praised both for their ray tracing implementation and game-play performance. With last week\\'s PC release of Red Dead Redemption 2 as a strong gaming lineup for the holiday season, our business reflects this growing excitement. RTX GPUs now drive more than 2/3 of our desktop gaming GPU revenue.\\\\nGaming laptops were a standout, driving strong sequential and year-on-year growth. This holiday season, our partners are addressing the growing demand for high-performance laptops for gamers, students and prosumers by bringing more than 130 NVIDIA-powered gaming and studio laptop models to market. This includes many thin and light form factors enabled by our Max-Q technology, triple the number of Max-Q laptops last year.\\\\nIn late October, we announced the GeForce GTX 1660 Super and the 1650 Super, which refresh our mainstream desktop GPUs with more performance, faster memory and new features. The 1660 Super delivers 50% more performance than our prior-generation Pascal-based 1060, the best-selling gaming GPU of all time. It began shipping on October 29, priced at just $229. PC World called it the best GPU you can buy for 1080p gaming.\\\\nWe also announced the next generation of our streaming media player with 2 new models, Shield TV and Shield TV Pro, which launched on October 28. These bring AI to the streaming market for the first time with the ability to upscale video real time from high definition to 4K using NVIDIA-trained deep neural networks. Shield TV has been widely recognized as the best streamer on the market.\\\\nFinally, we made progress in building out our cloud gaming business. Two global service providers, Taiwan Mobile and Russia\\'s Rostelecom with GFN.ru joined SoftBank and Korea\\'s LG as partners for our GeForce NOW game-streaming service. Additionally, Telef\\\\u00f3nica will kick off a cloud gaming proof-of-concept in Spain.\\\\nMoving to data center. Revenue was $726 million, down 8% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially. Our hyperscale revenue grew both sequentially and year-on-year, and we believe our visibility is improving. Hyperscale activity is being driven by conversational AI, the ability for computers to engage in human-like dialogue, capturing context and providing intelligent responses. Google\\'s breakthrough, introduction of the BERT model, with its superhuman levels of natural language understanding, is driving a way of neural networks for the language understanding. That, in turn, is driving demand for our GPUs on 2 fronts. First, these models are massive and highly complex. They have 10 to 20x, in some cases 100x, more parameters than image-based models. As a result, training these models requires V100-based compute infrastructure that, in orders of magnitude, beyond what is needed in the past. Model complexity is expected to grow significantly from here.\\\\nSecond, real-time conversational AI requires very low latency and multiple neural networks running in quick succession from de-noising to speech recognition, language understanding, text-to-speech and voice encoding. While conventional approaches fail at these tasks, NVIDIA\\'s GPUs can handle the entire inference chain, in less than 30 milliseconds. This is the first AI application where inference requires acceleration. Conversational AI is a major driver for GPU-accelerated inference.\\\\nIn addition to this type of internal hyperscale activity, our T4 GPU continue to gain adoption in public clouds. In September, Amazon AWS announced general availability of the T4 globally, following the T4 rollout on Google Cloud platform earlier in the year. We shipped a higher volume of T4 inference GPU this quarter with V100 training GPUs, and both were records. Inference revenue more than doubled from last year and continued a solid double-digit percentage of total data center revenue.\\\\nLast week, the results of the first industry benchmark for AI inference, MLPerf inference, were announced. We won. In addition to demonstrating the best performance among commercially available solutions for both data center and edge applications, NVIDIA accelerators were the only ones that completed in all 5 MLPerf benchmarks. This demonstrates the programmability and performance of our computing platform across diverse AI workloads, which is critical for wide-scale data center deployment and is a key differentiator for us.\\\\nSeveral product announcements this quarter helped extend our AI computing platform into new markets, the enterprise edge. At Mobile World Congress, Los Angeles, we announced a software-defined 5G wireless RAN solution accelerated by GPUs in collaboration with Ericsson. This opens up the wireless brand market to NVIDIA GPUs. It enables new AI applications as well as AR, VR and gaming to be more accessible to the telco edge.\\\\nWe announced the NVIDIA EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform. With an ecosystem of more than 100 technology companies worldwide, early adopters include Walmart, BMW, Procter & Gamble, Samsung Electronics, NTT East and the cities of San Francisco and Las Vegas. Additionally, we announced a collaboration with Microsoft on intelligent edge computing. This will help industries better manage and gain insights from the growing flood of data created by retail stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and urban infrastructure.\\\\nFinally, last week, we held our GPU Technology Conference in Washington, D.C., which was sold out with more than 3,500 registered developers, CIOs and federal employees. At the event, we announced that the U.S. Postal Service, the world\\'s largest delivery service with almost 150 billion pieces of mail delivered annually, is adopting AI technology from NVIDIA, enabling 10x faster processing of package data and with higher accuracy.\\\\nMoving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $324 million, up 6% from the prior year and up 11% sequentially driven primarily by mobile workstations. NVIDIA RTX graphic and Max-Q technology have enabled a new wave of mobile workstations that are powerful enough for design applications yet thin and light enough to carry. We expect this to become a major new category with exciting growth opportunities.\\\\nOver 40 top creative design applications are being accelerated with RTX GPUs. Just last week, at the Adobe Max Conference, RTX accelerated capabilities were added to 3 Adobe Creative apps. RTX-accelerated apps are now available to tens of millions of artists and designers, driving demand for our RTX GPUs. We also continue to see growing customer deployment of data science, AI and VR applications. Strong demand this quarter came from manufacturing, public sector, higher education and health care customers.\\\\nFinally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $162 million, down 6% from a year ago and down 22% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by a onetime nonreoccurring development services contract recognized in Q2. Additionally, we saw a roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue and general industry weakness. Our AI cockpit business grew driven by the continued ramp of the Daimler as they deploy their AI-based infotainment systems across their fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles.\\\\nIn August, Optimus Ride launched New York City\\'s first autonomous driving pilot program powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. Urban settings pose unique challenges for autonomous vehicles given the number of density of objects that need to be perceived and comprehended in real time. Our DRIVE computer and software stack allows these shuttles to safely and effectively provide first- and last-mile transit services. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in auto. Our offering is -- consists of in-car AV computing platforms as well as GPU servers for all AI development and simulation. We believe we are well positioned in the industry with leading end-to-end platform that enables customers to develop, test and safely operate autonomous vehicles, ranging from cars and trucks to shuttles and robo-taxis.\\\\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. Q3 GAAP gross margins was 63.6%, and non-GAAP was 64.1%, up sequentially, reflecting a benefit from sales of previously written-off inventory, higher GeForce GPUs average selling prices and lower component costs. GAAP operating expenses were $989 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $774 million, up 15% and 6% year-on-year, respectively. GAAP EPS was $1.45, down 26% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.78, down 3% from a year ago. Cash flow from operations was a record $1.6 billion.\\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox.\\\\nWe expect revenue to be $2.95 billion, plus or minus 2%. This reflects expectations for strong sequential growth in data center, offset by a seasonal decline in notebook GPUs for gaming and Switch-related revenue. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 64.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.02 billion and $805 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.\\\\nIn closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on December 3, Deutsche Bank\\'s Auto Tech Conference on December 10 and Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 11.\\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          For my first one, you mentioned that you were seeing strong sequential growth in the data center going into Q4. Jensen, I was wondering if you could give us some color on what\\'s driving that, and just how you think about the sustainability of data center growth going into next year and what markets do you think will drive that. Is it more enterprise, more hyperscale, more HPC? Just some color on near and longer term on data center. And then I have a follow-up for Colette.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Thanks a lot, Vivek. We had a strong Q3 in hyperscale data centers. As Colette mentioned earlier, we shipped a record number of V100s and T4s. And for the very first time, we shipped more T4s than V100. And most of the T4s are driven by inference. In fact, our inference business is now a solid double-digit, and it doubled year-over-year. And all -- most -- that is really driven by several factors. The -- as you know, we\\'ve been working on deep learning for some time, and people have been developing deep learning models. It started with computer vision. But image recognition doesn\\'t really take that much of the data center capacity.\\\\nOver the last couple of years, a couple of very important developments have happened. One development is a breakthrough in using deep learning for recommendation systems. As you know, recommendation systems is the backbone of the Internet. Whenever you do shopping, whenever you\\'re watching movies, looking at news, doing search, all of the personalized web pages, all of just about your entire experience on the Internet is made possible by recommendation systems because there is just so much data out there putting the right data in front of you based on your social profile or your personal use patterns or your interest or your connections. All of that is vitally important. For the very first time, we\\'re seeing recommendation system based on deep learning throughout the world. And so increasingly, you\\'re going to see people roll this out. And the backbone of the Internet is now going to be based on deep learning.\\\\nThe second part is conversational AI. Conversational AI has been coming together in pieces; at first, speech recognition, which requires some amount of noise processing or beam forming. Then you go into speech recognition. Then it goes to natural language understanding, which then gets connected to a recommendation system, which then gets connected to text-to-speech and a speech encoder. And then that has to be done very, very quickly. Whereas images could be done off-line, conversation has to be done in real time. And without acceleration and without NVIDIA\\'s accelerators, it\\'s really not possible to do it in real time. It takes seconds to process all of the handful of deep learning models, and now we\\'re able to do that all on an accelerator and do it in real time.\\\\nAnd so the combination of these various breakthroughs from deep learning-based recommenders, the speech stack as well as natural language understanding breakthrough in what is called a bidirectional encoded transformer, that breakthrough is really quite significant. And since then, derivative works have come from that approach. And natural language understanding is really, really working incredibly well. And so what we\\'re seeing people do is -- the hyperscalers across the world, we work with just about everybody, this area of work is really complicated. The models are very, very large. There\\'s a whole bunch of models that has to work together, and  they\\'re getting larger. And so that\\'s one large category, which is the hyperscalers.\\\\nThe second, which we introduced this quarter, is really about taking AI out to the edge. And the reason for that is because there are many applications, whether it\\'s based on video or other types of sensors of all kinds where there\\'s a vibration sensor, temperature sensors, barometric sensor. There\\'s all kinds of sensors that are used in industries to monitor the health of equipment, monitor the conditions of various situations. And you want to do the processing at the point of action. This way, you don\\'t have to screen the data, which is continuous back into the cloud, which costs a lot of money. You want to take the action at the point of action because latency matters. Maybe you\\'re controlling gates or vehicles or robots or drones or whatnot.\\\\nAnd then lastly, one major issue is data sovereignty. Maybe your company doesn\\'t own all of the data that you are processing and, therefore, you have to do that processing at the edge, and you can\\'t afford to put that into the cloud. And so these various industries: retail, warehouse, logistics, smart cities, we\\'re just seeing so much enthusiasm there around that. And this -- so we built a platform called the EGX, which basically is a cloud native, completely secure, takes advantage of NVIDIA\\'s full stack of every single model. And it\\'s managed with Kubernetes remotely, and you could deploy these services at the edge in faraway places because IT departments can\\'t afford to go out there to manage them. And we\\'ve seen some really great adoption. We announced this last quarter. Walmart is using our platform. BMW is using it for logistics, Procter & Gamble for manufacturing, Samsung Electronics for manufacturing, visual inspection. And then last week, we announced probably the largest logistics operation in the world, the United States Postal Service.\\\\nAnd so those are -- I would say that intelligent edge will likely be the largest AI industry in the world for rather clear reasons. If you just kind of estimated the size of retail, it\\'s nearly $30 trillion. And if retail stores could be made a little bit more convenient, it could save the industry a lot of money: warehouses, logistics, transportation, farming. I think there\\'s like 0.5 million farms in the world, covers 1/3 of the world\\'s land mass. And so there\\'s a lot of places where AI could be put at the edge and could make a big difference. And I think this is going to be the grand adventure that we started this last quarter with the announcement of NVIDIA EGX.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Right. And Jensen, as quick follow-up, on PC gaming, how are you looking at growth going forward in that you had a very good quarter in October? I think in January, you\\'re probably guiding to some seasonal declines, but I imagine a lot more of that is due to console decline. Just how are you looking at PC gaming growth going into October -- into January and then next year as you get competition from 2 new consoles that are also supposed to come out?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. The -- during Q3 -- during Q4 and Q1, we see normal seasonal declines of console builds, and we also see a normal seasonal decline of notebook builds. And the reason for that is because the notebook vendors have to line up all their manufacturing in Q3 so that they could meet the hot selling season in Q4. And so we\\'re seeing -- what we see in the Q4 and Q1 time frame are just normal seasonal declines of these systems. Overall, for PC gaming -- and RTX is doing fantastic. Let me tell you why it\\'s so important. I would say that at this point, I think it\\'s fairly clear that ray tracing is the future and that RTX is a home run. Just about every major game developer has signed on to ray tracing. Even the next-generation consoles had to stutter step and include ray tracing in their next-generation consoles. The effects -- the photorealistic look is just so compelling, it\\'s not possible to really go back anymore. And so I think that it\\'s fairly clear now that RTX ray tracing is the future. And there are several hundred million PC gamers in the world that don\\'t have the benefits of it, and I\\'m looking forward to upgrading them.\\\\nSecond, and this is a combination of RTX and Max-Q, we really created a brand-new game platform, notebook PC gaming. Notebook PC gaming really didn\\'t exist until Max-Q came along. And our second-generation Max-Q, this last season, really turbocharged this segment. Over 100 laptops now are available for PC gaming. And my sense is that this is likely going to be the largest gaming platform, new gaming platform that emerges. And we\\'re just in the beginning innings of that. And so the combination of upgrading the entire installed base of PC gamers to RTX and ray tracing and this new gaming segment called notebook PC gaming is really quite exciting, and it\\'s going to drive our continued growth for some time. And so I\\'m excited about that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have a follow-up if I can as well. Just thinking about the trajectory of gross margin here, solid gross margin upside in the quarter, you also noted that you had the benefit of selling through some written-off components. So I guess first question is what was that impact in this most recent reported quarter. And how do we think about the trajectory of gross margin here even beyond the January quarter? What should we be thinking about in terms of that gross margin trend? And again, I have a quick follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thanks for the question. In the current quarter, the net benefit, as we refer to as the net release of our inventory provisions primarily associated with our components, was about 1 percentage point to our overall gross margin. As you know, going forward, mix is still the largest driver of our gross margin over time. Over the long term, we do expect gross margins to improve, and we\\'ll continue to see, outside of the benefit that we received, gross margin improvement for the long term.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. As you know, just to add to that, as you know, NVIDIA\\'s really become a software company. If you take a look at almost all of our products, the GPU -- having the world\\'s best GPU, of course, is the starting point. But almost everything that we do, whether it\\'s in artificial intelligence or data analytics or health care or robotics or self-driving cars, almost all of these platforms: gaming, rendering, cloud graphics, all of these platforms start from a really rich stack of software. And you can\\'t just put a chip in these scenarios and they work. And so most of our businesses are now highly software-rich, and they address verticals that we focus on. And then secondarily, we\\'re a platform company. And so our platform is available from all the OEMs and cloud providers. And as a platform company that has a great deal of software intensity, it\\'s natural that the margins would be higher over time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Very helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you\\'ve seen hyperscale -- your hyperscale business within data center grow both on a quarter-over-quarter as well as year-over-year basis in this last print. You also mentioned that your visibility is improving. Can you just help us understand what exactly you\\'re seeing in the hyperscale guys because it feels like there\\'s some mixed data points out there? What underpins your improved visibility? Or what are you seeing in that piece of your business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. We had a strong Q3. We\\'re going to see a much stronger Q4. And the foundation of that is AI, it\\'s deep learning inference. That is -- this deep learning inference is understandably going to be one of the largest computer industry opportunities. And the reason for that is because the computation intensity is so high. And for the very first time, aside from computer graphics, this mode of software is not really practical without accelerators. And so I mentioned earlier about the large-scale movement to deep learning recommendation systems. Those models are really, really hard to train.\\\\nI mentioned earlier about conversational AI. Because conversation requires real-time processing, several seconds is really not practical. And so you have to do it in milliseconds, tens of milliseconds. And our accelerator makes that possible. What makes it really complicated and the reason why -- although so many people talk about it, only we demonstrated -- we submitted all 5 results -- all 5 tests for the MLPerf inference benchmark, and we won them. And the reason for that is because it\\'s far more than just a chip. The software stack that sits on top of the chip and the compilers that sits on top of the chip are so complicated. And it\\'s understandably complicated because a supercomputer wrote the software, and this body of software is really, really large. And if you have to make it both accurate as well as performant, it\\'s really quite a great challenge. And it\\'s one of the great computer science challenges. This is one of those problems that hasn\\'t been solved, and we\\'ve been working hard at it for the last 6, 7 years now.\\\\nAnd so this is really the great opportunity. We\\'ve been talking about inference for some time now. Finally, the workloads and a very large diverse set of workloads are now moving into production. And so I\\'m hoping -- I\\'m enthusiastic about the progress and seeing the trends and the visibility that inference should be a large market opportunity for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess I\\'d love to follow on, on that last question. So clearly, your commentary, Jensen, here is much more bullish than I\\'ve heard you, I think, before on inference, particularly as it relates to this first benchmark. And so I guess can you talk a bit about how you see mix within data center looking out over the next 12, 24 months as you see kind of training versus inference as well as cloud versus enterprise, considering, I would think, inference over time could be -- could grow into a large opportunity there as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. C.J., that\\'s really good. Let me break it down. So when we think about hyperscale, there are 3 parts: training, inference and public cloud.\\\\nTraining, you might have seen the work that was done at open AI recently where they\\'ve been measuring and monitoring the amount of computation necessary to train these large models. These large models are now only getting larger. The amount of data necessary, therefore, has to scale as well. The computation is now growing and doubling every 3 months. And the reason for that is because of recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding. And all of a sudden, a whole wave of problems are now able to be solved. And just as AlexNet 7 years ago kind of was the watershed event for a lot of computer vision-oriented AI work, now the transformer-based natural language understanding model and the work that Google did with BERT really is a watershed event also for natural language understanding. This is, of course, a much, much harder problem. And so the scale of the training has grown tremendously. I think what we\\'re going to see this year is a fair number of very sizable installations of GPU systems to do this very thing, training.\\\\nThe second part is an untapped market for us, and this untapped market is really inference. The reason why I haven\\'t really spoken about it until now is because we\\'ve never really been able to validate our intuition that inference is going to be a large market opportunity for us, that it\\'s going to be very complicated. The models are very large. They\\'re very diverse. They require large amount of computation, large amount of memory bandwidth and large amounts of memory and large and significant capabilities of programmability. And so I\\'ve talked about this before, but I\\'ve never been able to validate it. And of course, with MLPerf and sweeping the benchmarks and, frankly, only -- the only one although so many have attempted, they submitted results and some of them resented it, that this benchmark is just really, really hard. Inference is hard. And then finally, our business results also validated the -- our intuition. And so our engagement now with CSPs are now global. We\\'re working across natural language understanding, recommendation systems, conversational AI, just a whole bunch of really, really interesting problems.\\\\nNow the cloud is the third piece. And the reason why cloud is growing so well and represents about half almost of many of our CSPs, particularly the ones with the public cloud, the reason for that is because the number of AI start-ups in the world is still growing so incredibly. I think we\\'re tracking something close to 10,000 and more AI start-ups around the world. In health care, in transportation, in retail, in consumer Internet, in Fintech, the number of AI companies out there is just extraordinary. I think over the last 3 or 4, 5 years, some $20 billion, $30 billion have been invested into start-ups. And these start-ups, of course, use cloud service providers so that they don\\'t have to invest in their own infrastructure because it\\'s fairly complicated. And so we\\'re seeing a lot of growth there.\\\\nAnd so that\\'s just the hyperscalers. The hyperscalers give us 3 points of growth -- 3 areas of growth: training, inference and public cloud. And the public cloud is primarily AI start-ups. Then there\\'s the intelligent edge, which we recently ventured into, and we\\'ve been building this platform called EGX for some time. And it\\'s cloud native. It\\'s incredibly secure. You can manage it from afar. It\\'s -- the stack is complicated. It\\'s performant. And we saw some -- we\\'ve been working with some early adopters. And this last quarter, we announced some of them: Walmart and BMW and Procter & Gamble and the largest logistics company in the world, USPS. And so this new platform, I think, long term, will likely be the largest opportunity. And the reason for that is because of the industries that it serves.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          There are a lot of concerns around China trade tensions, economic slowdown. But history has shown that gamers tend to be less sensitive to these macro trends and, in fact, also somewhat insensitive to price changes, at least at the enthusiast level. So given that China is such a big part of the gaming segment, can you just discuss the gaming demand trends out of this geography?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Gaming is solid in China, and it is also the fastest adopter of our gaming notebooks. This gaming RTX notebooks or GeForce notebooks is really a brand new category. This category never existed before because we couldn\\'t get the technology in there so that it\\'s both delightful to own as well as powerful to enjoy. And so we saw really great success with RTX notebooks and GeForce notebooks in China, and RTX adoption has been fast.\\\\nYour comments make sense because most of the games are free-to-play these days. The primary games that people play are esports, which you want the best gear, but you could -- after you buy the gear, you pretty much enjoy it forever; and mobile, which is largely free-to-play. You invest in some of your own personal outfits. And after that, I think you can enjoy it for quite a long time. And so the gear is really important. One of the areas where we\\'ve done really great work, particularly in China, has to do with social. We have this platform called GeForCe Experience. And as an extension of that, there\\'s a new feature called RTX Broadcast Engine. And it basically applies AI to broadcasting your content to share it. You could make movies. You could capture your favorite scenes and turn it into art, applying AI. And one of the coolest features is that you could overlay yourself on top of the game and share it with all the social networks without a green screen behind you. We use AI to stitch you out, basically, to cut you out of the background and irrespective of what noisy background you\\'ve got.\\\\nAnd so as you know, China has really a super hyper social community -- communities back there and they have all kinds of really cool social platforms to share games and user-generated content and short videos and all kinds of things like that. And so GeForce has that one additional feature that really makes it successful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wanted to ask on automotive. Colette, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your legacy infotainment business being down in the quarter. Just curious, what percentage of automotive revenue at this point is legacy infotainment versus the newer AI/ADAS solutions? And more importantly, Jensen, if you can speak to the growth trajectory in automotive over the next 1.5 years, maybe 2, that would be appreciated. And I do ask the question because it feels like we\\'ve heard many, many announcements, customer announcements, collaborative work that you\\'re doing with your customers, yet we haven\\'t quite seen sort of a hockey-stick inflection that some of us were expecting a couple of years ago. So just kind of curious when we should -- how we should set our expectations going forward.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Toshiya, let me address the first question regarding our legacy infotainment systems for our automotive business. It is still representing maybe about half or more of our overall revenue in the automotive business. We have our AI cockpit continuing to grow and grow quite well, both sequentially as well as year-over-year, as well as our autonomous vehicle solutions that we may be doing, including development services.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let\\'s see. The -- we\\'re the first -- probably the first AV car that\\'s going to be passenger-owned on the road, and I think we\\'ve talked about it before, is Volvo. And we\\'re expecting them to be in the late 2020, early 2021 time frame. And I\\'m still expecting so. And then there\\'s the 2022, 2023 generations. Most -- I would say most of the passenger-owned vehicle developments are going quite well. The industry, as you know, is under some amount of pressure, and so a lot of them have slipped it out a couple of years or so. And this is something that I think we\\'ve already spoken about in the past.\\\\nOur focus, our strategy consists of several areas. One area, of course, is passenger-owned vehicles. The second part is robot taxis. We have developments going with just about every major robot taxi company that we know of. And they\\'re here in the states. They\\'re in Europe. They\\'re in China. And when you hear news of them, we\\'re delighted to see their progress. And then the third part has to do with trucks, shuttles and increasingly a large number of vehicles that don\\'t carry people, they carry goods. And so we have a major development with Volvo. That was Volvo Trucks. Volvo Cars and Volvo Trucks, as you know, are 2 different companies. One of them belongs to Geely, Volvo Cars. Volvo Trucks is the heritage Volvo. And we have a major program going with them to automate the delivery of goods.\\\\nYou also see us during various GTCs, I\\'ll mention companies that we\\'re working with on grocery delivery or goods delivery or within a warehouse product delivery. You\\'re going to see a whole bunch of things like that because the technology is very similar, and it\\'s starting to -- the development -- the technology we develop for passenger-owned vehicles has started to propagate down into logistics vehicles. I continue to believe that everything that moves eventually will have autonomous capability or be fully autonomous. And that, I think, is, at this point, fairly certain.\\\\nNow our strategy is both in developing the in-car AV computing system, and it\\'s software-defined, it\\'s scalable, as well as the AI development and simulation systems. And so when somebody\\'s working on AV and they\\'re using AI, and most of them are, there\\'s a great opportunity for us. And when they start ramping up and they\\'re collecting miles of data, it becomes a very large market opportunity for us. And so I\\'m anxious to see every single car company be as progressive and aggressive in developing AV. And they will be. They will be. This is a foregone conclusion.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have 2 data center questions for Colette. The first question, I want to return to your kind of outlook for strong sequential data center growth in Q4. Now this business grew 11% sequentially in Q3. And you didn\\'t actually call out strong growth as we were going into the quarter. You are calling it out for Q4. Does that suggest to me that you expect sequential growth in Q4 to be stronger than Q3 given you\\'re calling it out in Q4 and you didn\\'t call it out in Q3? Or would you define like what you saw in Q3 as well as already being strong sequential growth? Like how do we think about the wording of that in relation to what we\\'ve seen in Q3 and what you expect for Q4?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, Stacy. When we had provided guidance in Q3 and how we finished the quarter in Q3, we had indicated that our growth would stem from both gaming and data center. We completed that. And we also had stronger than expected from guidance from both gaming and data center in our Q3 results. Moving to Q4, Q4 is a sequential decrease in totality versus Q3. We have reminded the teams about our overall seasonality that we sometimes have in gaming associated with our consoles as well as also with our notebooks that seem to be primarily in Q2 and Q3 being our strongest quarters and likely, therefore, a seasonal downtick as it move to Q4. What we wanted to do was, if we have in totality overall decline associated with that, we did want to emphasize what we are expecting in terms of data center with the overall strong growth sequentially.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So I guess to ask the question again, would you define what you saw in Q3 as being strong growth as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I would believe our growth of 17% was higher than we expected to Q3. Again, when we get into Q4, we\\'ll see how the quarter ends in terms of data center, but we are expecting strong growth. Thanks, Stacy.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And for my second question, hyperscale you said was up year-over-year. Now -- and that\\'s after, off of last year, where it was the peak. Inference doubled year-over-year. And this suggests to me -- I know you said enterprise was down year-over-year. But this suggests to me that it wasn\\'t just down year-over-year, it was down a lot year-over-year. How do we think about that in the context of like the growth that we\\'ve seen very strongly over the last few quarters in enterprise. And going back to your commentary at the Analyst Day, which was almost entirely about the opportunity coming from enterprise growth, what\\'s going on there? What drove that? And what should we expect going forward?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Our enterprise business has been beginning to ramp from over a year ago at a very, very, very small base. We\\'ve continued to see great traction in there with a lot of the things that we\\'ve announced throughout. But keep in mind in our year ago quarter, we also had very strong systems and a very large deal associated with our DGX. So when we look from a quarter-over-quarter period or just looking at 1 quarter, we can have a little bit of lumpiness. So that year-over-year impact is really just due to an extremely large deal in the prior year Q3.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I apologize for any background noise, but I just have one question, just for Jensen. So in 2018, can you give us a rough update on what the GPU utilization was for deep learning application? What it is today? I\\'m just wondering how the -- how that\\'s advanced over the last couple of year or 2.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let\\'s see. I would say 2018, it was nearly all related to training. And this year, we started to see the growth of inference to the point where we now -- we have now sold more -- this last quarter, we sold more T4 GPUs for inference than we sold V100s that\\'s used for training, and both of them were record highs. And so the comment that Colette just made, comparing to year-over-year, we had a large DGX system sale a year ago that we didn\\'t have this year. But if you excluded that, the V100 and the T4 is doing great. They\\'re at record levels. And T4 didn\\'t hardly existed a year ago, now it\\'s selling more than V100s, and both of them are record highs. And so that kind of gives you a feeling for it. I think that\\'s really the major difference that inference is really kicking into gear, and my sense is that it\\'s going to continue to grow quite nicely.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the 5G opportunity that you announced at Mobile World. And I guess you talked a lot about AI and IoT services in a C-RAN environment. But is there -- how big is that opportunity? And can you address kind of the core compute aspect to C-RAN with the GPU?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. If you look at the world of mobile today, there are players that are building DRAMs and their radio heads in the BBU, basically the baseband units. In the data center where people would like to move the software for radio networks, it\\'s really an untapped market. And the reason for that is because the CPU is just not able to support the level of performance that\\'s necessary for 5G. And ASICs are too rigid to be able to put into a data center. And so the data center needs a programmable solution that is data center-ready that can support all of the software richness that goes along with the data center, whether it\\'s a VM environment like VMware. And we -- recently, during the quarter, we announced another partnership with VMware. They recognize that increasingly, our GPUs are becoming a core part of data centers and cloud. We had a partner -- we announced a partnership with Red Hat. They realize the momentum that they\\'re seeing us in, in telcos, and they would like to adapt their entire stack from open stack to OpenShift on top of our GPUs. And so now with VMware, with Red Hat, we\\'re going to have a world-class telco enterprise stack that ranges all the way from hypervisors and virtual machines all the way to Kubernetes.\\\\nAnd so our strategy is to -- our goal is to really create this new world of C-RAN, vRAN centralized data centers and software-defined networking. And the software-defined networking will, of course, include things like in the data center networking as well as  firewalls. But the computationally-intensive stuff is really the 5G radio. And so we\\'re going to create a software stack for 5G and basically exactly the same way that we\\'ve done for creating a -- excuse me, a software stack for deep learning. And we call it Aerial. Aerial is to 5G essentially what Cuda-NN is for deep learning and essentially what optics is for ray tracing. And this software stack is going to allow us to run the whole software -- run the whole 5G stack in software and deliver the highest performance, the incredible flexibility and scale to as many layers of MIMO as customers need and to be able to put all of it in the data center.\\\\nThe power of putting it into data center, as you know, is flexibility and fungibility. With the low latency capability of 5G, you could put a data center somewhere in the regional hub. And depending on where the traffic is going, you could shift the traffic computation from 1 data center to another data center, something that you can\\'t do in basebands, in baseband units in the cell towers, but you can do that in the data center. And that helps them reduce the cost. The second benefit is that the telcos would love to be a service provider for a data center\\'s computation at the edge. And the edge applications are things like smart cities and whether it\\'s warehouses or retail stores or whatever it is because they\\'re geographically located and is distributed all over the world. And so to be able to use their data center to also be able to use AI in combination with IoT is really exciting to them. And so I think that that\\'s really -- this is really the future that we\\'re going to see a lot more service providers at the edge. And these edge data centers will have to run the data center, the networking, including the mobile network and software as well as run 5G and IoT -- AI and IoT applications\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your last question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarsh V. Kumar,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I apologize for the background noise. But Colette, maybe you could give us an idea of gaming. In the guidance, it\\'s down. And I was wondering, could you maybe give us the impact of the console business versus the laptop and give us an idea of what might be the bigger driver there?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I would say, for our Q4, both of them are expected to be seasonally down. In the case of the consoles, we do wait for Nintendo to assist in terms of what they need. So we will have to see how the quarter ends on that. But in both cases, in totality, these businesses have ranged, maybe in totality of the 2, of about $500 million a quarter. And we\\'ll see both of them sequentially decline. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'ll now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, everyone. We had a good quarter driven by strong gaming growth and hyperscale demand. We\\'re making great strides in 3 big impact initiatives. The world of computer graphics is moving to ray tracing, and our business reflects that. Some of the biggest blockbuster games this holiday season and beyond are RTX-enabled, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare; and the best-selling game of all-time, Minecraft. Design applications used by millions of artists and creators are rapidly adopting RTX ray tracing. We\\'re reinventing computer graphics and look forward to upgrading the hundreds of millions of PC gamers to RTX.\\\\nHyperscale demand was strong this quarter, and our visibility continues to improve. The race is on for conversational AI, which will be a powerful catalyst for us in both training and inference. And lastly, we have extended our computing platform beyond the cloud to the edge, where GPU-accelerated 5G, AI and IoT, will revolutionize the world\\'s largest industries. We look forward to updating you on our progress in February.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference call.

Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 2019 marked another major milestone in our multiyear journey. We delivered record annual revenue of $6.73 billion, and significantly increased both gross margin and net income as we successfully introduced and ramped the strongest product portfolio in our 50-year history. We grew clients and server processor annual revenue by $1.5 billion in 2019, driven largely by the strong demand for our 7-nanometer Ryzen and EPYC processors, powered by our Zen 2 processor core. \\\\nLooking at the fourth quarter, we ended the year very strong with quarterly revenue increasing 50% year-over-year to a record $2.13 billion, while also significantly increasing net income. \\\\nTurning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Fourth quarter revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $1.66 billion. Ryzen processor adoption accelerated sharply in 2019, helping to drive significant double-digit percentage increases in client processor annual unit shipments, ASPs and revenue. We ended 2019 with our highest quarterly client processor unit shipments in more than 6 years based on strong demand for Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. \\\\nIn desktop, we had a very strong holiday season as our second- and third-generation Ryzen processors consistently held top sales spots at the largest global e-tailers and retailers. We launched our Ryzen 3950X processor and the 24- and 32-core versions of our third generation Ryzen Threadripper processors in November. Our 16-core Ryzen 3950X processor is the world\\'s fastest mainstream desktop processor, while our latest Threadripper CPUs offer unmatched performance for the high-end desktop market. \\\\nIn January, we expanded our leadership position in the HEDT market with the launch our flagship 64-core Ryzen Threadripper processor, which is the world\\'s highest performance desktop processor. \\\\nIn mobile, we had our eighth straight quarter of strong double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth as we expanded the number of AMD-powered laptops available for major OEMs. We began shipping our Ryzen 4000 mobile processors powered by our Zen 2 core at the end of the fourth quarter. These new processors double the performance per watt of our prior generation and deliver leadership single-threaded, multi-threaded and graphics performance for thin and light notebooks while enabling the industry\\'s first ultrathin laptops with 8 cores. Initial systems featuring the Ryzen 4000 processors are expected to launch later this quarter, and more than 100 AMD-based consumer and commercial laptops are planned for 2020, from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other major OEMs. \\\\nIn Graphics, fourth quarter unit shipments grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year, driven by sales of our Radeon RX 5000 series GPUs, featuring our new RDNA architecture. We further expanded our portfolio of RDNA GPUs with the introductions of the 5500 XT and 5600 XT desktop graphics cards, highlighted by strong third-party reviews that clearly establish 5600 XT as the most powerful gaming GPU available for under $300. \\\\nWe launched our Radeon 5000M mobile GPUs in the quarter as well, and we are seeing solid design win momentum based on their strong performance and power efficiency. The first laptops powered by the new GPUs are available now, including the recently updated Apple MacBook Pro, and we expect many more notebooks featuring our Radeon 5000M GPUs to launch throughout 2020. \\\\nData center GPU revenue increased sequentially, driven by cloud, VDI and game streaming deployments. We announced a major update to our open-source GPU computing software stack in the fourth quarter, featuring performance optimizations, expanded development tools and support for the most popular machine learning frameworks. We continue making strategic software investments to make it easier for developers to tap into the full capabilities of our Radeon Instinct accelerators for HPC and AI applications. \\\\nFor the year, data center GPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage as we continue to make progress growing our presence in this important part of the market. \\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue of $465 million increased 7% year-over-year, as EPYC processor revenue growth offset declines in semi-custom revenue. Semi-custom sales continued to soften in the quarter in advance of the next-generation console launches from Sony and Microsoft planned this year. For 2020, we expect first quarter semi-custom revenue to be negligible, and the ramp of next-generation semi-custom products to start in the second quarter, with revenue to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. \\\\nIn server, revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage as unit shipments and ASPs increased sequentially, driven by demand for our second-gen EPYC processors. Our second-gen EPYC processors are ramping significantly faster than the first generation as we see particular strength for our higher core count models where our performance and TCO advantages are the most significant. \\\\nCloud adoption with the largest providers continues to accelerate, driven by the expanding use of EPYC processors to power their critical internal workloads as well as a significant increase in the number of AMD-powered instances publicly available. Shipments to cloud providers increased sequentially by a significant double-digit percentage to support expanding build-outs at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Tencent. Microsoft announced the availability of 4 new virtual machines, and AWS announced 2 new EC2 instances powered by second-gen EPYC processors. \\\\nIn the Enterprise, Dell began shipping their full portfolio of servers powered by our latest EPYC processors. We have doubled the number of EPYC processor platforms in market to more than 100 offerings in the quarter. These new platforms are driving increased enterprise customer engagements, broadening our sales pipeline considerably. \\\\nIn HPC, we secured multiple large wins in the quarter based on our unmatched performance and scalability, highlighted by French, German and U.K. national supercomputing center deployments as well as the San Diego Supercomputing Center. \\\\nWe are pleased with the significant traction and momentum in our server business and remain on track to achieve our goal of double-digit percentage unit share by midyear based on the growing demand for our second-gen EPYC processors. \\\\nI am very proud of our 2019 accomplishments as the successful ramps of our latest Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processors resulted in record annual revenue and substantial increases in gross margin and net income. \\\\nI want to take a moment to recognize the more than 11,000 AMDers around the world, whose focus and determination enabled us to achieve these results. We entered 2020 well positioned to continue gaining share across the PC, gaming and server markets based on having an unmatched portfolio of leadership products, spanning from desktops to laptops, data centers and game consoles. With more than 27-nanometer designs in production or development, we are very excited about our next wave of products that can accelerate our growth in 2020 and beyond. \\\\nWe are still in the early stages of our journey and remain focused on meeting our commitments as we establish AMD as the high-performance computing and graphics leader. \\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2019 was an outstanding year for AMD. Our competitive product portfolio and market share gains drove the highest annual and highest quarterly revenue in AMD\\'s history. We achieved our highest annual gross margin percentage and annual free cash flow since 2011, and we improved non-GAAP earnings per share by 39% year-over-year. In short, we are very pleased with our financial performance. \\\\nFourth quarter revenue was $2.13 billion, up 50% from a year ago and up 18% from the prior quarter, driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon GPUs, partially offset by softer semi-custom sales. Gross margin was 45%, up 360 basis points from a year ago, driven primarily by sales of our leadership 7-nanometer products. \\\\nOperating expenses were $545 million, with increased investments in go-to-market activities and R&D, compared to $474 million a year ago. Operating income was $405 million, up $296 million from a year ago, driven by revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 19% as compared to 8% a year ago. Net income was $383 million, up $296 million from a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.32 per share compared to $0.08 per share a year ago. \\\\nNow turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.66 billion, up 69% year-over-year, driven by Ryzen processor and Radeon gaming GPU sales growth. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $360 million or 22% of revenue compared to $115 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue. \\\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $465 million, up 7% from $433 million the prior year. The continued growth of EPYC processor sales was partially offset by softer semi-custom revenue. EPYC processor revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially, driven by robust shipments of our second-generation EPYC processors. EESC segment operating income was $45 million or 10% of revenue, driven by EPYC processor sales, compared to an operating loss of $6 million a year ago. \\\\nDuring the quarter, we reduced gross debt by $524 million, which resulted in a GAAP loss of $128 million. These debt reductions result in an annualized interest expense savings of approximately $16 million. \\\\nFree cash flow was positive $400 million in the fourth quarter, and cash flow from operations was $442 million. Inventory was $1 billion, down 6% from the prior quarter. \\\\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $469 million compared to $152 million a year ago, driven by higher quarterly earnings. \\\\nNow let me cover the full year results. 2019 revenue was $6.73 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Computing and Graphics segment and sales of second-generation EPYC processors, partially offset by a decline in semi-custom sales. Excluding semi-custom, revenue was up more than 20% year-over-year. Gross margin of 43% was up 420 basis points from the prior year, driven by our current generation of Ryzen and EPYC products. Operating expenses were 31% of revenue as we increase go-to-market activities and investments in R&D. 2019 operating income was up 33% from a year ago to $840 million or 12% of revenue. Net income was $756 million, up 46 -- 47% from the prior year. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. I am extremely pleased with our progress on the strengthening balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion at year-end, while gross debt was $563 million. This represents our highest net cash position since the third quarter of 2006. Full year free cash flow was $276 million. \\\\nWe reduced principal debt by almost $1 billion in 2019, and ended the year with less than $600 million of gross debt. \\\\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, resulting in gross leverage of 0.5x, down from 1.9x at the end of 2018. \\\\nNow turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2020. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 42% year-over-year and a decrease of approximately 15% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by strong growth in Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon product sales. The sequential decrease is driven primarily by negligible semi-custom revenue, which continues to soften in advance of the ramp of next-generation products in addition to seasonality. \\\\nIn addition, for Q1 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $580 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $18 million; and the first quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.22 billion shares. \\\\nFor the full year 2020, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% to 30%, driven by strength across all businesses. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 45%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 28% of revenue and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 3% of pretax income. \\\\nIn closing, we had an excellent fourth quarter and an excellent 2019. Our full year financial results highlight the strength of our business model. I look forward to what we have in store for 2020 as we expect to further expand and ramp our leadership portfolio of high-performance products to drive revenue growth, gross margin expansion, market share gains and financial momentum. \\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you very much, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready to begin polling for questions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Lisa, for my first one, you mentioned the goal to get to kind of this double-digit market share in servers by the middle of the year. I\\'m just wondering how the visibility is around in achieving this target. What\\'s driving it? Is it just more instances at existing cloud customers? And as part of that, do you also have a share target for exiting this year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Vivek, thank you for the questions. So, look, we are very pleased with how Rome is ramping. We\\'ve been in market now 4 to 5 months, and the visibility that we have is -- with the cloud guys, we have visibility to the public-facing instances as well as what they\\'re doing in terms of internal workloads. And what we see is just the breadth of the overall workloads that are -- that they\\'re using Rome with is expanding. And then on the enterprise side, with the full portfolio of our partners, HPE, Dell, Lenovo and the ODM partners, we see just a significantly -- significant increase in the overall enterprise pipeline that we have for Rome. So we\\'re very focused on continuing to grow share in the data center market, and we feel good about our mid-year market share targets. \\\\nIn terms of our market share targets, Vivek, I think we\\'ll talk a little bit more at our Financial Analyst Day about some of the longer-term targets. But certainly, for 2020, we\\'re very focused on growing our overall data center share.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And for my follow-up, Lisa. How should we interpret the impact of capacity shortages at your main competitor? Have you seen any benefit from that? If not, why not? \\\\nAnd then kind of part B is, Intel did say that they plan to expand capacity later this year and will focus it more on the PC client side and try to reclaim market share. What effect will that have on the pricing in the market? And does your full year outlook kind of bake any potential impact of that competition?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So when we look at the PC market, we finished 2019 very strong in the overall PC market, both mobile and desktop. I think that\\'s primarily on the strength of the product portfolio and the expanding customer platforms that we have. There are some discussions about, let\\'s call it, pockets of shortages. But as I said before, I don\\'t believe -- we\\'ve been on this steady increase in market share now for the last 8 quarters, and we believe we gained share in Q4 as well. So I think what we see is just the portfolio getting a lot stronger. \\\\nAs we go into 2020, I think we are, again, enthusiastic about our products. In addition to the Zen 2-based desktop products, we\\'ve added Zen 2 now in the notebook portfolio, and we\\'ll have that for the full year of 2020. So I think our outlook expects growth in all businesses, including the PC business. And we remain very focused on expanding our market presence in both consumer as well as commercial PCs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, this may overlap a little bit with Vivek\\'s question, but I was hoping to better understand some of the key assumptions behind your full year guidance. For both your PC business as well as the server business, can you talk to some of the TAM assumptions that you\\'re making and the market share assumptions for the full year? And then I\\'ve got a quick follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, sure. So let me talk first about the market, and then talk a little bit about how we\\'re seeing the full year. So if you look at the PC market, I think, the discussion so far has been, let\\'s call it, 2020, flat to maybe down slightly. There has been some concern raised about the second half of \\'20 perhaps be weakened -- weaker than normal seasonality just due to some of the enterprise refresh cycles that are strong in the first half. We\\'re viewing it as flat -- flattish, maybe down very slightly. \\\\nThat being the case, back to the comment I made with Vivek, I think we feel very good about our product portfolio, and especially when we look at sort of our notebook share and our relative opportunity to gain market share. The strength of our Ryzen 4000 series products is significantly stronger than previous generations, and the platforms are also significantly broader. So we feel good about that. \\\\nIn the data center market, again, I would say that the growth of computing continues. From our standpoint, we see it as a good market environment for data center in both cloud as well as enterprise. When we look at our full year revenue guide of approximately 28% to 30% for the year, the highest growth from a percentage standpoint will obviously be server, just given the expectations in that market. But we expect all of our businesses to grow nicely in 2020. And that\\'s just, again, based on where we are in the product cycle and the visibility that we have with customer design wins as well as just overall competitiveness.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And then I had a quick follow-up on gross margins, one probably for Devinder. You guys are guiding Q1 gross margins to 46% and then 45% for the full year. I appreciate your semi-custom business is at a low point in Q1 and the ramp in Q2 and more so in the second half is probably dilutive to corporate margins. But if you can kind of walk through some of the puts and takes from a gross margin perspective for the year, that would be helpful. \\\\nAnd then related to that, if you can compare and contrast the gross margin profile of your semi-custom business going into the next cycle versus the past cycle, product cycle, that would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, let me start, and then Lisa can chime in. Overall, from a margin standpoint, you got it right. We are guiding to the 46% in the Q1 quarter. \\\\nAnd then the semi-custom business, as we\\'ve said, typically, is lower than corporate average. So as that product ramps in the second half, obviously, will have an impact on gross margin. The guide for the year is at 45%. So we feel good about that having ended 2019 at the 43% level. \\\\nAnd from a puts and takes standpoint, it\\'s certainly product mix. And Lisa talked about the business is ramping and growing in 2020, with a 28% to 30% growth in revenue. Data center, as we\\'ve said before, is above corporate average. The client gross margin is around corporate average. And some graphics and then the semi-custom business has below corporate average gross margins. And that mix of revenue, as it ramps throughout the year, will obviously have an impact on a quarterly basis. From an annual standpoint, we feel pretty good with the guide at 45%, in particular with the 7-nanometer products ramping as we get to the year. And that obviously benefits the gross margin. \\\\nSemi-custom business, Lisa, you want to chime in on the difference between generation to generation?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. No, I think -- I just said, Devinder, the semi-custom margins tend to be below corporate average on a gross margin basis. Although, on an operating margin basis, given the contribution from our customers for the R&D, is actually quite good. As it relates generation to generation, the way to think about it is, in the first year of a console ramp, you would expect the margins to be on the lower side. And that\\'s true no matter what, just because you\\'re just starting the product ramp. And you should expect that the margins will get better as that ramp continues over time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I wanted to just start with a question about the, I guess, comparing and contrasting a little bit, maybe a little weaker than we had -- some of us had modeled and, I guess, due to the console stuff for Q1 in the guidance versus a really strong, so 28% to 30% growth for the year. Maybe if you could just sort of lay out the year a little bit at a high level and just how you guys are sort of thinking about it coming together from the point of Q1.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. So look, Matt, we\\'re pretty excited about 2020. It\\'s a strong year for us, certainly, with the expectations of being around 28% to 30% revenue growth. We do expect all of our businesses to grow. I think relative to the Q1 guide, if you look at Q1 as an absolute number, it is up over 40% year-on-year, even with semi-custom revenues very low in Q1. And so that should give you an idea of the strength of the rest of the business. \\\\nFrom a sequential basis, Q4 to Q1, it\\'s what we said on the call. There is some bit of normal seasonality, just as we are consumer-focused in our PC portfolio. So you expect that, that would go down from Q4 to Q1. And then we do have the factor that the semi-custom profile when we\\'re doing a product transition has the revenue very low in Q1. It starts ramp in Q2, but it\\'s very heavily weighted in the second half of the year. So you should think about semi-custom for this year, again, it\\'s a ramp year, so it\\'s a little bit different, that over 80% of the revenue for semi-custom will be in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. So overall, we think a very strong year. A little bit of reprofiling of revenue, particularly as it relates to semi-custom. And we look forward to executing it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          As a follow-up, I guess, for both of you, but maybe for Devinder. Just a couple of little pieces. For me, it looks like, on the operating expense side, you\\'re going to be up in the neighborhood of mid-20s for the full year in the annual guidance that you outlined. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the focus of that. Is it branding and marketing in the PC and server spaces as you grow? Or is it in other areas in R&D? \\\\nAnd then, secondly, I think you guys had disclosed the data center revenue mix. So GPU plus server in prior quarters. And if you have that number handy, that would be really helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, let me take the second one first. Data center, it\\'s, as we said in the past, mid-teens of revenue. In this quarter, it is around the same, mid-teens of the total revenue. And I\\'ll point out that it is record revenue in the quarter, so that\\'s pretty good. And we feel pretty good about that, having mid-teens revenue in the data center, combined server and data center GPU, on revenue of $2.1 billion. \\\\nAs far as OpEx is concerned, our guide for the year is about 28% of the revenue guide that we provided. And you are right, fundamentally, the investments are R&D and go-to-market. And obviously, the business is growing. So obviously, there\\'s investments needed to go ahead and grow the business from an absolute standpoint. But we feel we can manage it to about 28% of our revenue overall for the year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Matt, the only thing I\\'ll add to that is for the data center revenue, particularly in Q4, it was very heavily weighted towards server CPU, just given some of the lumpiness of the data center GPU revenue.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. I had one for Devinder and one for Lisa. For Devinder, the -- I think it\\'s impressive that the cash that you generated 10 years ago, you were at $4 billion of net debt, now you\\'re net cash positive. I didn\\'t think back then we\\'d expect you to be here. But how should we think about capital structure going forward? And the -- and for the $400 million -- $440 million in cash flow from operations, could -- I had a challenge reconciling it. Can you share the biggest 2 or 3 sources of cash? \\\\nAnd then for Lisa, the last time AMD had a product cycle in servers, I think you were gaining -- once you hit 5% share, you started to gain share at 2% or 3% or 4%, 400 basis point clip per quarter. How should -- what is the right kind of cadence or pace of share gains in servers this cycle? And maybe you could just talk about, structurally, what gates your ability to -- or the pace of your ability to gain share? Is it capacity from your suppliers? Is it your own engineering support infrastructure? Or is it your customers testing and importing workloads? If you could give us a framework to think about that, I think that would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, let me get started, Mark. You do have a long memory, and so do I. I do remember the days when we had the challenge on the balance sheet. And one thing we feel good as we end 2019 is the strength of the balance sheet, and in particular, the net cash position we haven\\'t been in many, many years, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks. \\\\nFrom a capital structure standpoint, another priority is investing in the business. The revenue is growing significantly in 2020 is what we\\'re projecting at 28% to 30% over 2019. And also, we want to invest in the road map, the go-to-market and everything that\\'s needed when the revenue ramps as significantly as it is going from year-over-year. So that\\'s really the allocation priorities. \\\\nFrom a viewpoint of where the $440 million comes from, higher revenue, especially when you look at the revenue in Q3 and Q4 of 2019 compared to the first half of the year, we did go ahead and buy the inventory to go ahead and support the higher revenue. And as you know, when you sell that revenue, in particular, when it ramps up as it did on better margins, it generates the cash. And that\\'s why you have the $440 million-plus operating cash flow from an overall standpoint. Lisa, over to you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Mark, as it relates to just server rate and pace, I think the most important thing for us is when we look at from time of announcement or time of shipment to how customers actually deploy and trying to shorten that cycle. So when I look at the difference between, let\\'s call it, Rome and Naples, we\\'ve seen that time to deploy actually significantly shortened with Rome. And so in terms of rate and pace of server share gain, it is primarily for cloud customers. It is having them deployed, not just sort of a set of instances, but ensuring that they get fully built out across all regions in the world, and also adding additional workloads. So it\\'s just time is what I would say. \\\\nAnd then as it relates to Enterprise customers, I think the platform coverage that we have with Rome is significantly broader than it was with Naples. And so I\\'m quite encouraged, actually, by the strength of the pipeline that we see, the number of customers that are engaged, and then just how they\\'re deploying. So I think we\\'re going at a good pace, and we\\'ll continue to accelerate that as we go through 2020.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had a -- first, a question on gross margin, especially into Q1. You said consoles are negligible. Gross margins are 46%, so that suggests that, that 46% is basically indicative of the business as it stands without consoles. So does that represent kind of the peak of the business on the current mix? I\\'m a little surprised it\\'s not higher, given all the new products in aggregate, we\\'re supposed to have gross margins in excess of 50%, and most of the mix today should be new products. So I guess, how do we think about the Q1 gross margins in the context of that? And what are the drivers that take it higher from here? Is it basically just server mix? Or is there something else that can help with that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let me get started, and Lisa can add. But Stacy, as we talked about product transitions, the 46% guide in Q1, we recently introduced the next-generation notebook products. And as product transitions go, you still have legacy product that you sell before you get converted over to the new technology and the new generation products. The desktop products were ahead of that from that standpoint, and that did benefit our margin in the 2019 time frame. And you are right, the console being negligible revenue in Q1 of 2020, it does benefit, and the margin is 46%. \\\\nAnd from an overall standpoint for the year, it is 45%, and that\\'s because the semi-custom business, which is lower than corporate average, does come back. And as Lisa said earlier, we\\'re expecting 80% of that in the back half of the year. But by that time, also, the new generation products and the other businesses including data center and client reramping all on 7 nanometers, and that should help the gross margin to offset some of the impact that we have on the semi-custom business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, that\\'s good, Stacy. I was just going to add to what Devinder said. So we don\\'t expect the client notebook mix to fully cut over to the new 7-nanometer products until later in the year. And in terms of opportunities to improve margins, it is definitely product mix. So higher mix of server as well as higher mix of, let\\'s call it, Ryzen 7s and Ryzen 5s versus some of the legacy products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. For my follow-up, if I sort of squint at the second half, it seems to me you\\'re probably guiding it implicitly, call it, $800 million to $1 billion over the second half of 2019. How much of that do you think is consoles versus nonconsoles? Because it\\'s not hard to get a console number, especially in the beginning of a ramp that\\'s not that far off that number, which doesn\\'t leave all that much room to ramp the rest of the business. So is this just conservatism? Or what else are you expecting here? How much of that second half do you think is consoles versus nonconsoles?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, I think, as I perhaps answered to one of the earlier questions, when I look at the full year at 28% to 30% sort of revenue growth, expect server to be significantly above that. And then the rest of the businesses are all going to grow nicely. And so you would expect significant double-digit growth in the client business as well as in the semi-custom business. And overall, we see the aggregate of it to be a very strong year. So it is not all console-weighted, if that\\'s what you\\'re asking.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. Wouldn\\'t you get that just from the nature of the ramp that we saw in 2019, we\\'d be doing the compare already? I guess I\\'m trying -- that\\'s why I\\'m trying to sort of normalize second half to second half. You think you get strong double digits in second half versus second half growth across all the businesses?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I would say, in aggregate, you will see -- so let me help you with this way. So what we said in 2019 is, 2019, overall, we grew 4% on an annual basis, but excluding semi-custom, we grew over 20% through all the rest of the businesses. If I do that same type of calculation, excluding semi-custom for 2020, we would still say the rest of the businesses would grow greater than 20%.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from David Wong from Instinet.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Devinder, you said the sequential decrease in the March 2020 quarter is driven primarily by the drop in game console chips. Does that mean that you expect your microprocessor and graphics revenues will be flattish sequentially? Or if not, roughly, what does your guidance assume in terms of percentage sequential drop for, say, PC processors and GPUs? Do you get server processors sales rising sequentially?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I don\\'t think I said specifically that Q4 to Q1 is all due to semi-custom. That obviously helps the margin. But there is a product mix underneath that, that helps, especially with the notebook products that we talked about, that are moving to 7 nanometers. \\\\nAnd then I think your second question about sequential from Q1 outwards, is that right, David?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, no. I was talking about revenues from December into Q1, the sequential drop. Can you give us some idea of -- I mean there\\'s a big chunk that\\'s game consoles, right? But I mean, what about the nongame console part of it?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It\\'s seasonality, seasonality in the business. We have the consumer weight from a revenue standpoint in our CG segment, and we go from Q4 to Q1, and you do have the seasonality coming into play. And typical seasonality is what\\'s driving the other portion of the decline in revenue from Q4 to Q1.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. David, I think what you\\'re asking is we would expect that the Computing and Graphics segment would be down sequentially due to seasonality, and we would expect that server CPUs should be up because we\\'re continuing to ramp those processors sequentially.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Michael Wong,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. And Lisa, can you give us some idea of what new GPUs you\\'re expecting to launch through the rest of 2020 for PCs and for data center?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So in 2019, we launched our new architecture in GPUs, it\\'s the RDNA architecture, and that was the Navi-based products. You should expect that those will be refreshed in 2020, and we\\'ll have next-generation RDNA architecture that will be part of our 2020 lineup. So we\\'re pretty excited about that, and we\\'ll talk more about that at our Financial Analyst Day. \\\\nAnd on the data center GPU side, you should also expect that we\\'ll have some new products in the second half of this year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Devinder, you had talked about consumer graphics as being below corporate gross margin. I guess I was thinking that -- I know you\\'ve historically had a high cost structure because of high bandwidth memory. But as the product portfolio increasingly doesn\\'t use high bandwidth memory, is there the prospect to improve that for consumer GPU to be closer to where your competitors\\' gross margins are?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I don\\'t think I specifically said that. I said some of our graphics products are below corporate average from a gross margin standpoint, in addition to the semi-custom being below average.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And I think, Joe, maybe just to answer your question in terms of what we expect in consumer graphics. I think -- look, we\\'re investing in consumer graphics. We think gaming is a very important segment, whether we\\'re talking about consoles or discrete graphics. And the work that we\\'re doing around the RDNA architecture and the future generations of RDNA architecture we believe will continue to improve our offerings for both consumer graphics as well as data center graphics.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. And then with the new console builds, you mentioned that, that starts in Q2, but it\\'s mostly in the back half of the year. I guess as you think about that opportunity from a unit standpoint, is it the right way to look at it sort of a similar number of units to what we had in the first year of the current console cycle? \\\\nOr is there -- does the compatibility that you bring when you have an x86 CPU still and there\\'s probably a little bit more similarity between the consoles, could that point us to a sort of a better console unit market in 2020 than we saw 6 years ago? Like how are you thinking about it, just to size that opportunity?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we do think there\\'s some pent-up demand for the next generation of consoles. Without forecasting what our customers are planning, I would say they\\'re both -- we\\'re planning for a strong first year, and we\\'ll have to see how things develop as we go through the ramp. But the overall sentiment is that there has been, let\\'s call it, a lull in console sales in the second half of 2019 going into in 2020, sort of -- for some of this anticipation of the next generation.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Maybe just following up on Joe. I just want to make sure I heard you right. I thought you said the semi-custom as well we grew at double digits, I just want to confirm that. \\\\nAnd then just following on, I don\\'t know what the units are going to be, but is there a content or ASP story to layer on top of that equation as well?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I did say that semi-custom should grow double-digit as well. And again, it\\'s a strong year for us. And then as it relates to content, again, it\\'s fair to say that there is additional content in this generation versus previous generation.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got you. And then maybe just on the gross margin equation. Is there a way to talk about the mix of 7-nanometer? That\\'s a big tailwind. Still seems early days, at least, across a couple of your products. Is there a way to kind of think about the whole company and what the mix of 7 is?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we just completed the fourth quarter, and it was a very strong quarter for us, record revenue for the company. And I would say about half of that revenue was 7-nanometer-based, and the other half, not yet. And so there is still a significant ramp as we go into 2020. But we\\'re pleased with how quickly we ramped in 2019.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Congratulations on solid results. I just want to go back to the gross margin bridge from Q1 to the full year. I just want to make sure I understand. The drop from Q1 to the full year, is that 100% being driven just by gaming coming back more aggressively in the back half of the year? Or have you baked in anything for either pricing competition from the #1 guy out there or some share shifts? How do I think about that? Is it all about gaming?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think if you -- maybe Devinder, you...\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, go ahead.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right. So I think if you look at it, the predominant factor, if you\\'re talking about Q1 guide at 46% versus full year at 45%, it\\'s just as we wrap those consoles, there are some -- yes, there\\'s some impact of that. As it relates to the pricing environment and what we\\'re expecting, we\\'re expecting a competitive pricing environment, and that\\'s the way we built our model. So we\\'ve always expected that the competition will be very aggressive on both the CPU as well as the GPU side. And that is part of the inherent model for the company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s helpful, Lisa. And then you guys have a ton of goodness on your immediate plate on the server side and the data center side, just with the workloads you\\'re going after. But I\\'m kind of curious, you answered an earlier question saying expect more GPUs for the data center. And I don\\'t want you to preannounce product, but how should I think about your positioning for AIs and workload and acceleration? \\\\nAnd just given some of the heavy lifting that NVIDIA had to do around CUDA, how do I think about the investment there? Is this an area that you think you have some unique IP you can bring to? Or how do I think about that over the next couple of years?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I think that\\'s actually a good way of talking about the opportunity, John. I think the CPU opportunity is very immediate and in front of us as we look at the opportunities with Rome and the expanding opportunities. I think the data center GPU market continues to be an important growth vector for us, and now I call that over the several-year horizon. So when you look at the opportunities that we have, when we combine our CPU and GPU IP together, they\\'re very, very strong. I mean, for example, this is the reason that we won the Oak Ridge National Lab Supercomputer with Frontier, which were actually both a CPU and a GPU win, and some of the optimization that we\\'ve done with that overall system. We think that there are additional opportunities like that as well as machine learning and AI opportunities. Our focus there has been to work with large cloud providers to optimize the machine learning frameworks. And we had some key milestones that we completed in the fourth quarter that will continue to be a focus for us in 2020 and beyond.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Is it fair to say some of the GPU data center announcements this year go beyond just the cloud gaming market?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think you should expect that we will have additional sort of customer announcements outside of cloud gaming.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess I had another question, just -- well, that\\'s really on gross margin. (inaudible) of the year\\'s revenue in the semi-custom would be in the back half, but how does that break out between September and December? I guess I asked that because I\\'m just trying to see what the gross margin will be exiting this year if you strip out semi-custom. Could it be 50% exiting the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I think it\\'s hard to break it down that way. We are in the initial stages of planning for the ramp, and you\\'re asking about Q3, Q4. We are projecting about 80% of the semi-custom revenue growing double digits year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. And typically, when we have this new game launches, our peak quarter from a revenue standpoint in semi-custom will be Q3. But Q4, when you talk about the ramp of the product, especially in the first year of the ramp, it\\'s hard to project how much it will be and then what the impact would be exiting 2020 from a gross margin, excluding semi-custom. Maybe as we get closer to that, I\\'m talking about 3 to 6 months, we can probably give you a better idea of that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I got it, okay. And then can you just talk about what your share targets are for the year in PC? I think you\\'re 17, 18 in notebook and you\\'re maybe 14 in desktop. Can you just talk about how much share you think that you can gain this year given all the moving parts with the shortages and whatnot?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I\\'m not sure I\\'m going to forecast a share target for 2020. I will say though, if you take a look back at the last 8 quarters, we\\'ve been on a fairly steady share gain in PCs, somewhere between -- depending on the quarter, let\\'s call it, 50 to 100 basis points per quarter, and that changes between desktop and notebook. I think we grew somewhere on the order of 4 points a share. So we believe that we still have additional opportunities, and particularly, our focus is going to be both notebook as well as commercial. And those are good opportunities for us and play well to our new Ryzen 4000 mobile processors.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Most of my questions been answered, and it kind of lines up with the model we got here, but I just want to make sure I got a couple of quick questions. And so, basically, for Q4, it looks like semi-custom is probably down 50% sequentially or somewhere around that range. Is that -- am I at least in the ballpark? \\\\nAnd then, secondly, from a server perspective, I\\'m not expecting you to give numbers on this, but maybe qualitatively, how much of your revenue is going to be cloud versus enterprise? And I think that\\'s one of the bigger debates, and I don\\'t expect specifics, but anything you could to help us understand what should be the mix between cloud and enterprise for calendar \\'20.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, Mitch. So look, I think you\\'re right. When you look at the semi-custom business in the fourth quarter, it is -- it was a bit softer than originally anticipated. So we had originally said last quarter that we thought the second half of the year would be down high-30s, and we were actually down more than that for the second half of the year and for Q4. And as it relates to mix of cloud versus enterprise for 2020, I mean, it will move around from quarter-to-quarter. But I think the best guess at this point is, let\\'s call it, roughly even between the two.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question today is coming from Srini Pajjuri from SMBC.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSrinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, maybe on the supply side, you\\'re guiding for a pretty strong growth here. I\\'m just curious, have you already logged in the supply for 7-nanometer? \\\\nAnd as we go into second half of the year, especially as you ramp the game consoles, I believe that those die sizes tend to be very large. I\\'m just curious if you were to get upside, how are you feeling about your supply situation?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So TSMC has supported us very well through the first couple of quarters of our 7-nanometer ramp here in 2019. I think, as we go into 2020, there will certainly be a significant growth for us in 7-nanometer. Our current visibility supports the revenue guide that we gave you. It is fair to say that wafer supply is tight, and so it\\'s really important for us to be planning well with our customers, and that\\'s what we\\'re working on.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\\'d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A.

Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well on the third quarter. We continued to build momentum for our new products as strong sales of our Ryzen and EPYC processors offset soft GPU channel sales and drove our fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth, increased profitability and margin expansion. Third quarter revenue was $1.65 billion, an increase of 4% from a year ago. \\\\nLooking at our Computing and Graphics segment, third quarter CG segment revenue increased 12% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in both client processor and OEM GPU sales that offset a larger-than-expected decline in channel GPU sales. Ryzen processor sales increased to more than 70% of our total client revenue in the quarter. We delivered our highest processor unit shipments in nearly 4 years and believe we gained desktop and notebook client processor unit share in the quarter, driven by growth with both OEMs and in the channel. \\\\nIn desktop, we had strong demand for our higher-end Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen Threadripper processors, helping to drive a double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequential improvement in client processor ASP. We expanded our desktop offerings in the quarter, bringing our Zen processor core and Vega graphics to the entry-level part of the market with the Athlon APU and launching our flagship 32-core Threadripper 2 processor. With these new introductions, we now have a top to bottom lineup of client processors based on our high-performance Zen architecture. \\\\nIn notebooks, Ryzen Mobile processor unit shipments doubled sequentially for the second straight quarter as OEMs ramped production of their latest AMD-based notebooks. 54 of the 60 Ryzen processor-based notebooks planned for 2008 (sic) [2018]  have launched, with the final notebooks expected to go on sale this quarter. Based on the success of first-generation Ryzen Mobile notebooks, the expanded breadth of our customer engagements and our design win momentum, we are on track for an even larger assortment of AMD-powered notebooks in 2019. \\\\nIn graphics, the year-over-year revenue decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower channel GPU sales, partially offset by improved OEM and data center GPU sales. Channel GPU sales came in lower than expected based on excess channel inventory levels caused by the decline in blockchain-related demand that was so strong earlier in the year. OEM GPU sales in the third quarter increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year as new design wins began to ramp, including first shipments of our mobile Vega GPUs to support new premium notebooks launching this quarter. \\\\nIn professional graphics, revenue increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, driven by data center GPU sales as we continued to gain traction in this important part of the market. We launched the Radeon Pro WX 8200 GPU for workstations in the quarter, delivering the world\\'s best workstation graphics performance under $1,000 on real-time visualization, VR and photorealistic editing workloads. We remain on track to launch the industry\\'s first 7-nanometer data center GPU this quarter. Customer interest in the product is strong based on its performance and differentiated feature set, and we have already secured multiple data center wins with shipments expected to begin in the fourth quarter. We continued to increase investments in GPU hardware and software to deliver industry-leading products that we believe will drive growth in the gaming, professional and data center markets. \\\\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Third quarter revenue decreased 5% year-on-year primarily based on semi-custom sales declining, as expected, as current generation consoles entered their sixth year. \\\\nIn server, we delivered our third straight quarter of strong double-digit percentage sequential revenue and unit shipment growth. We are seeing the largest demand for our top of the stack 24- and 32-core EPYC processors, which combine industry-leading core count and I/O to deliver performance advantages across cloud, virtualization and HPC workloads. We continued to accelerate engagements with our cloud service providers, highlighted by yesterday\\'s announcement that Oracle launched new AMD-powered emphasis that offer significant TCO and performance advantages on general-purpose cloud workloads and Oracle applications. We expect additional Tier 1 cloud service providers to announce availability of new EPYC processor deployment this quarter. We secured multiple new customer wins on the HPC front, including Microsoft\\'s announcement they would offer an EPYC processor-based supercomputing instance, and that Haas Racing has chosen Cray to build an EPYC-powered supercomputer to improve their computational fluid dynamics modeling for future cars. \\\\nTurning to enterprise adoption. We continue to build a strong pipeline and accelerate the ongoing ramps of EPYC-based offerings from the major OEMs, including Cisco, Dell and HP Enterprise. In the third quarter, we added dozens of new end customers across oil and gas, health care, aerospace, banking and other industries based on the superior performance of EPYC processors in both data analytics and general-purpose virtualized workloads. We began sampling our next-generation Rome server chip broadly across our customer base in the third quarter, and the feedback on this leadership product is very strong. As a result, cloud and OEM customers are engaging earlier, deeper and more collaboratively with us on both Rome and our long-term data center road map. We remain on track to exit the year with mid-single-digit server unit market share based on cloud customer adoption. And based on our strong competitive position and broad customer engagements, we believe we can achieve double-digit server unit share with Rome.\\\\nIn closing, 2018 remains an inflection point for AMD as we expect to exit the year with well over 50% of our revenue coming from new products, driving significant margin expansion. The foundational changes we have made across the business to strengthen our execution, and the investments we have made to deliver a leadership Computing and Graphics road map are paying off. Our current generations of high-performance CPUs and GPUs are doing very well in market, putting us on track to increase profitability, grow revenue and expand margin for the second straight year. We see significant opportunities to build on this momentum as we transition to our next generations of high-performance products and launch the industry\\'s first 7-nanometer x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs over the coming quarters. Demand for our high-performance computing offerings remains strong, and our product portfolio and competitive positioning are getting stronger. We remain focused on executing our strategy and delivering our leadership product road map. \\\\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was a good quarter for AMD as revenue, operating margin and earnings per share grew year-over-year. Gross margin was 40%, highlighted by the continuing ramp of our new Ryzen and EPYC products. We strengthened the balance sheet, reduced long-term debt by $97 million and further improved our gross leverage. Quarterly revenue of $1.65 billion was up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue with higher client revenue more than offsetting global graphics revenue; third quarter revenue including IP-related revenue, of which $86 million was related to our THATIC joint venture. \\\\nGross margin was 40%, up 390 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the ramp of new products, including Ryzen and EPYC processors. On a sequential basis, gross margin was up 280 basis points primarily driven by IP-related revenue and the ramp of new products. Excluding IP-related revenue and memory and inventory-related adjustments, third quarter gross margin would have been 2 percentage points lower. Operating expenses grew 12% year-over-year to $476 million, driven by R&D investments in our product road maps and incremental go-to-market investments. Operating income grew to $186 million from $148 million a year ago. Operating margin was 11%, and both business segments recorded double-digit operating margin percentage. Net income was $150 million compared to $100 million a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, using a diluted share count of 1,177,000,000, was $0.13 compared to $0.09 per share a year ago. \\\\nNow turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $938 million, up 12% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by strong Ryzen product sales as we expanded our client compute offerings in the quarter. Ryzen products accounted for more than 70% of client revenue, up from approximately 60% last quarter as we saw strength in both desktop and notebook offerings across OEM and channel partners. In graphics, channel GPU sales were down year-over-year, partially offset by strong Radeon data center and OEM GPU demand. For comparative purposes, third quarter 2017 blockchain-related GPU sales were approximately high single-digit percent of overall AMD revenue, while blockchain revenue in the third quarter of this year was negligible. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $100 million or 11% of segment revenues compared to operating income of $73 million a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a richer client product mix and IP-related revenue, partially offset by lower graphics revenue. \\\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $715 million, down 5% year-over-year. The year-over-year revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower semi-custom product and IP-related revenue, partially offset by higher server sales. For the third quarter in a row, EPYC processor units and revenue grew by strong double-digit percentages quarter-over-quarter. EESC operating income was $86 million or 12% of segment revenue. This is up from operating income of $74 million a year ago primarily due to a richer server and semi-custom product mix. \\\\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.06 billion at the end of the quarter, and we generated free cash flow of $62 million. Inventory was down sequentially from $750 million to $738 million. Total principal debt was $1.6 billion as we reduced our long-term debt by $97 million in the quarter. Term debt due in March 2019 is down to $66 million, and beyond that, there are no term debt maturities until 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million compared to $184 million a year ago, and on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $709 million, resulting in gross debt leverage of 2.2x. \\\\nNow turning to our financial outlook. For the fourth quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.45 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This would be an increase of approximately 8% year-over-year driven by sales growth of Ryzen, EPYC and data center GPU products. For comparative purposes, Q4 2017 revenue was $1.34 billion adjusted for the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard and included blockchain-related GPU sales of approximately low double-digit percent of overall AMD revenue. Sequentially, the midpoint of fourth quarter revenue outlook would be a decrease of approximately 12%, driven primarily by lower semi-custom sales. In addition, for Q4 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, up from 34% in the prior year driven by the ramp of Ryzen, EPYC and data center GPU processor sales; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $465 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million; and free cash flow to be positive. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect annual revenue growth of mid-20s percent and to be free cash flow positive, and we now expect non-GAAP gross margin in excess of 38%. \\\\nIn closing, the third quarter was a good quarter as we continue to ramp our new products. This momentum is driving improvement in our financial results against a backdrop of expanding customer demand as we prepare to ship and launch our first 7-nanometer GPU products before the end of the year. We are executing on our strategy and investment and financial priorities as we continue making excellent progress towards our long-term target financial model. \\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\\'re ready for our first question.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First question, if I may, Lisa, as you look into the fourth quarter and maybe discuss also the third quarter, can you just review the important puts and takes on the revenues, on the microprocessor and GPU side separately? And I know you don\\'t like to discuss the competition, but I think there are some unique things going on in the competitive environment. I think there\\'s a view that Intel is capacity-constrained in -- with NVIDIA\\'s new product launches, how is that impacting how we should be thinking about the revenues?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Mark, thanks for the question. So let me take those in order here. So if we just look at the third quarter revenue, I would say that we did see a shift in our revenue mix as we went through the third quarter. Looking at the individual product lines, we had expected that the client business would be strong as we were ramping quite a few new notebook OEM systems as well as we have strong desktop product portfolio. And we saw the client business was strong. It was actually up probably a bit stronger than we expected. The server business also performed quite well. In the graphics business, we had our OEM and data center compute business performing well, but we did see the softness in the channel that was larger than we expected, and that was due to some of the channel inventory comments that I made earlier. \\\\nNow as you shift into the fourth quarter, I think what we see is that our fourth quarter revenue mix really mixes towards the new products. And so what you see in the product lines are -- you\\'d see the client business continue to grow, and client is usually seasonally down into the fourth quarter. So we\\'re doing better than seasonality with the client business. We expect the server business to grow as well as we get more traction with our EPYC products, especially in the cloud. And then we would expect, with our graphics business, that, that will also grow sequentially primarily on the strength of new products around our data center GPUs and the semi-custom business actually will decline sequentially. Semi-custom business always declines in fourth quarter. I would say this fourth quarter is a bit more pronounced. It gets a bit more pronounced as we get later in the cycle as well as the fact that the 606 accounting regulations tended to pull some of the revenue earlier in the year. But hopefully, that gives you a view of sort of the puts and takes around revenue.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s very helpful, and if I follow up if I may. I think I heard Devinder say that you\\'re expecting to ship EPYC 2 before the end of this year. And if I think back to a dozen years ago when you had the second-generation server product, that kind of signaled an opportunity for an inflection in the revenues. How should we think about EPYC 2 as we go into early next year? And what does EPYC 2 bring to your customers that EPYC did not?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So Mark, maybe just a correction. So I think Devinder\\'s comment was that our 7-nanometer GPU would ship here in the fourth quarter, and we\\'re on track to launch that here shortly. The second-generation of EPYC, our 7-nanometer CPU, will ship in 2019. We are broadly sampling it now. I think from what we see, the performance is very competitive. And also, many of our customers have had a chance to really spend time with the first generation of EPYC, get to learn our architecture and do much of the platform bring-up. So we\\'re excited about what the second generation of EPYC can do for us. We\\'re -- and we\\'re going to talk a little bit more about that in a couple weeks at our data center event, but we believe that our competitive position gets stronger as we get into 2019.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, can you give us the puts and takes -- or Devinder or both, on the gross margin dynamic in Q3? And also, in Q4? Is there an IP component in Q4? And I have a follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Let me -- maybe let me start and then Devinder can add. So on the gross margin for the third quarter, I think we were up 4% year-on-year. We did have an IP component in this year as we had an IP component in the third quarter of last year. The majority of the improvement though was due to the positive product mix, sort of the client and server business really growing year-on-year and with that, improving the product mix. As we go into the fourth quarter, there is no IP-related revenue that\\'s planned right now. So with the guide at 41% margin, we really are at the -- let\\'s call it, the low end of our long-term guidance. And again, that\\'s on the strength of the product mix. It\\'s a very positive product mix for us. The processor business, as we\\'ve always said, the new products are accretive to margin. And so the client business is expected to grow. The server business is expected to grow. The data center GPUs are expected to grow. And then there is a portion of that, that is the semi-custom business declining sequentially, but I would say that\\'s the smaller portion. It\\'s really the positive product mix that\\'s going into the Q4 guide. And maybe, Devinder, is there anything you wanted to add?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          No, I think you covered it, Lisa. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. And then a follow-up. If you don\\'t mind as a follow-up. As we look into early 2019, what can we expect in terms of seasonality for the semi-custom part of the business and on the PC side just because there are some constraints out there that -- from Intel and so on?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So look, if you -- Hans, our typical seasonality is the second half of the year is stronger than the first half of the year. As we go into 2019, you would expect that the semi-custom business will be down relative to this year and then you would expect that we\\'re still going to need a bit of time to work through some of this graphics channel inventory that we have. But on the positive side, we do see strength in our processor business in both the client and the server side. As it relates to the current supply environment, we did see some pockets of constraints in the supply chain around PCs. We saw that towards the end of the third quarter. We are increasing our production such that we can satisfy some of that demand. And I think that\\'s a short-term statement, but I think on a midterm statement, it\\'s an environment where we\\'re partnering very closely with our OEMs to make sure their requirements are met.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen and Company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the last, I guess, couple of sentences in your prior answer there. There\\'s a lot of things moving in the model near term, but as we think about how you\\'re positioning the company in the client business over the next, I don\\'t know, 24 months or so, with some supply constraints at Intel and some changes in their marketing support for OEMs for some of those programs and their spending, how do you think about how you\\'re positioned with the key top 5 or 6 OEMs in terms of both PC and, I guess, desktop and notebook over the next 24 months? And sort of what are the puts and takes of how much you\\'re really willing to lean into that business in order to gain unit share?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. So on the PC business particularly around client processors, I am bullish on that business. It\\'s a good business for us. Our products are very well positioned when you look at both the desktop and notebook segment. It was important for us to get these new platforms out into the market, and so we have 54 new notebook platforms that are out in the market with a few more to go as we enter -- finish up here the fourth quarter. I think the traction that we see in terms of unit shipments, the metric around Ryzen being 70% of our client business -- over 70%, and we expect that to continue to accelerate. So we\\'re bullish on the client business as a good business for us to grow over the next 12 to 24 months.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. That\\'s helpful. And just as a follow-up, I understand in a couple of weeks, you\\'ll probably be talking a bit more about the data center GPU portfolio. But I guess there\\'s been a lot of movement in software ecosystem as you\\'ve been working, and the team has, to develop the MIOpen product in terms of software. Maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you feel that\\'s positioned for Caffe and Tensor, which, I guess, are the 2 key development environments for AI. And what do you think the long-term prospects for that business are over the next couple of years?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So on the data center GPU business, this will continue to be an area of investment for us. I think we\\'ve made very nice progress this year. I think as we finish up the year, we expected to again make good progress. We have invested in -- on both the hardware and the software side. So I think the 7-nanometer GPU starting shipments here in the fourth quarter is important for us. And on the software side, yes, we will also be updating the status of our software environment. I think the nice thing is, as we say, the data center is just an enormous opportunity, whether you\\'re talking about CPUs or GPUs, and we\\'re engaging deeply with cloud customers who are spending the time and the resources to optimize to our architecture. So again, I think it\\'s -- data center tends to take longer from design win to revenue, but we\\'re starting to see some nice signals there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I had 2 of them really quick. So first is actually on the CPU side, the server side. So is there any reason why a 10-nanometer chip wouldn\\'t be able to outperform your 7-nanometer product given that you\\'ve already been able to do some of the testing on the server side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Maybe I would answer the question this way. When we look at our 7-nanometer product and its positioning in 2019 across the server landscape, we feel very good about the positioning. I think it\\'s not just 7-nanometer. 7-nanometer is important, but we\\'ve also made some significant changes to the architecture as well as how -- sort of the system. So I think overall, we feel, with the design and process capabilities, that our 7-nanometer products will be quite competitive.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And then secondly from me, in terms of production, I know you guys have kind of given the mid-singles and kind of double-digit market share opportunity in the server side. So is that due to capacity constraint at TSMC? Or is that just due to your own estimates of what type of share you think you can get?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, we have a great relationship with TSMC. I think they\\'re very supportive of our road map in 7-nanometer. So it\\'s not due to any supply constraint. It\\'s just due to the time that we believe that we\\'ll take for vendors to really qualify new systems.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Just -- and just one last really small one from me. The graphics business, the highest blockchain or cryptocurrency quarter was Q1 of \\'18. Is that correct?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The highest -- it was between Q4 and Q1. They were pretty close.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          For the first one, Lisa, can you help us kind of quantify how much of a headwind was that excess -- the graphics inventory in Q3 and maybe also in Q4 so we can reconcile some of the differences between what you are reporting and guiding versus some of the consensus expectations out there?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure, Vivek. So the best thing I can say is when we look at the CG segment, that\\'s a segment -- we\\'re down about $150 million here in the third quarter. We had expected the segment to be down, but we probably expected it to be down about $50 million or so. And if you look at that difference from when we started the quarter, that\\'s entirely the GPU channel. We had some other puts and takes in there, but it\\'s basically the GPU channel. As we go into the fourth quarter, we do expect graphics to be up, and that\\'s primarily on the strength of the data center GPU business, and we\\'re modeling the channel as, let\\'s call it, roughly flattish. It\\'s seasonally about flattish, but given some of the inventory in the channel, that\\'s how we\\'re modeling. Does that help?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So basically, you\\'re saying this problem kind of goes away in Q4 or you\\'re done with it by now. Or can it continue to be a headwind in Q4?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, we are expecting that it might take a couple of quarters to completely get back to, let\\'s call it, a normal channel. However, it is factored into our Q4 guidance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          All right. And then the second one, Lisa, is on the server business. So you outlined the target to get to mid-single digit exiting this year. Is the next 5% share easier or tougher to get? How do you think your competitor will respond? And how important is it to ramp your 7-nanometer product next year to get towards that -- to make that jump from the 5% to the next target of 10% share?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So I -- the way I look at it, Vivek, is it\\'s really a continuum. And the continuum is we have a number of customers that are very actively working with EPYC. I think the first 5% does include some cloud customers ramping, and that\\'s important. And then as we go beyond that, we would expect that they\\'re more used to our architecture. Our architecture is socket-compatible between the first and second generation. We\\'re sampling it now. And so I think the idea is we would like to see some acceleration in that as we bring in the 7-nanometer product, but we\\'ll certainly have to go through that process.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First, I wanted to ask about graphics trajectory in the next year. I mean, given my math -- I know you talked about maybe $100 million light versus your expectation, but my math suggests that might have fallen as much as $250 million sequentially if you\\'re going to get it at least to the level that it was last year. Now if I look at what that trajectory means going further and if I ask you whether or not you thought graphics revenues to be down 20% year-over-year in 2019, like how would you feel about that? What\\'s your response to that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Stacy, let me make sure I clarify the first comment and then I\\'ll certainly answer the comment. My comment was at the segment level. So at the segment level, I said we were about $100 million light, and I also said that client performed a little bit better than expected. So I think you can say that it was probably -- if you -- that should help quantify sort of Q3. When I look at it going forward, I would not expect that type of decline on a year-on-year basis. I think what you\\'ll see is some funky seasonality, right. So the first half of the year was very strong for graphics. I think the first half of \\'19 will not be very strong for graphics, but we have a number of product launches coming up, and we\\'re pretty excited about some of those product launches. And so I would view that -- we need to work off some of this channel inventory that\\'s in place and then go back to sort of a more typical seasonality, which would see the second half stronger than the first. Does that help?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. That does help. For my follow-up, I want to ask about the data center GPU. So you\\'ve been talking a lot about that. You\\'ve actually been calling it out as driving, like, some of the growth in the current quarter and going forward. How big is that today? I mean, you\\'re calling it out, but like can you give us an order of magnitude? I mean, is it more than $20 million in the quarter at this point? Where do you see that going into Q4? And like what are your expectations as you ramp the 7-nanometer product in the next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You always have a way of asking the most granular questions.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I don\\'t think it\\'s that granular.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It is more than $20 million. We do see it as a driver. We do see it as more of a driver as we go into 7-nanometer. And this is one of those cases where typically, the data center products ramp slowly, but as you know, the deployments can sometimes be lumpy and there\\'s good traction on some early design wins. And so we expect it to be a meaningful contribution in Q4.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And just one more really quickly. How do you feel about your $0.75 in 2020? You\\'re still holding to that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          There are no changes to our long-term financial model at this point.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A. Graves,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Corporate VP of IR    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, not today.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Not today, okay.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I just want to go back to the IP side of things. You gave some color about the fact that it\\'s not contributing anything in the fourth quarter, and that\\'s helpful on the gross margin side. But one other detail, Devinder or Lisa, is I think the $86 million you talked about, you said that was a portion of the IP and then you had some other inventory-related changes. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the size of those different buckets? How big was IP overall? Anything there would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. On the IP, I think as we talked about, this $86 million is associated with our THATIC joint venture. There were some other IP, call it, about -- approximately about $35 million in the quarter, and that is why we talked about it in 2 parts.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then as my follow-up. As I\\'m looking at the GPU side of things, not to kind of beat the dead horse there too much more, but the ASP side of that equation or pricing side, is the channel inventory clearing dynamic something that also manifests itself on pricing pressure? Or is it just a matter of time to absorb that inventory, which, Lisa, I think you said, was going to be a flat dynamic in the fourth quarter but it sounded like it was going to be returning to a headwind in the first half of next year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes -- no. If that\\'s how it sounded, that\\'s not what I meant. So I would say that the GPU -- let\\'s call it, the weakness in the GPU channel or primarily in the sell-in is, let\\'s call it, for the -- we might see that for the next quarter or 2. But as you look through the overall business, I think -- gamers are still buying GPUs. And so this is really a matter of just absorbing some of the first half, let\\'s call it, oversupply as it relates to GPUs and that\\'s translating into a bit weaker sell-in. But we are still tracking the sellout and the sell-through, through the -- to the end customers.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And if I could sneak in one quick one. Just OpEx intensity, I know you\\'re not going to guide for OpEx for 2019, but the 26% to 29%, how do we think about where you are in the investment stage where, whether it\\'s the EPYC or the other new products -- EPYC 2, I should say, or the other new products where you kind of get over the hump and you don\\'t need to invest as much? Is that a framework we should think about? Or do you believe the opportunities are big enough and the competitors are spending enough that, that OpEx intensity in that range is likely to persist?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, I think, Ross, if you look on an annual basis for 2008 (sic) [2018] , we\\'ll be approximately 28% of OpEx to revenue. And I think what we\\'ve said in the past is we will grow OpEx but we will grow it slower than revenue growth on an annual basis. And that\\'s still our philosophy.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. If you said this, I may have missed it, but can you talk about how much servers grew sequentially in Q3? I guess you were fairly specific on that point in Q2. I think you said double digits this quarter. Do you expect to be sort of -- as you talk about it, mid-single digit next quarter, are you kind of half way to that target this quarter? Just help us calibrate where server is.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think, Joe, it\\'d be fair to say that we have strong double digits this quarter and we\\'d just say we\\'re about half way. I mean, I think that\\'s reasonable, plus or minus.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay, great. And then with regards to the 7-nanometer, I know you\\'re going to talk more about this at the product launch, but can you talk about what 7-nanometer itself gives you? Is it -- do you expect there to be a higher sort of clock speed on the microprocessors in the GPUs? Is it a better transistor budget? Is it better cost per transistor? Just what are -- obviously, there\\'s a lot riding on you guys being early in both segments on 7. Can you just talk about the benefit to that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. And we will go this -- go through this in a lot more detail on November 6, but at a high level, I think 7-nanometer gives us better density. So for a given system, we can put more cores on it. It gives us better power. So that gives us total cost of ownership, and it does give us better performance as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Lisa, congratulations on the strong gross margin results. I just wanted some clarification. The calendar fourth quarter guidance, does that include IP revenue in the gross margin? And clearly, gross margin is being helped in December by the growth in new products, but it\\'s probably also being helped by the sharp falloff in semi-customs. Should we think about kind of the gross margin level in December as being the new floor off of which you can continue to grow sequentially even as semi-custom comes back seasonally? Or how do I think about that? Then I have a follow-up.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So on the gross margin, you know, that was Q4 guidance, there is no assumed IP-related revenue. So that\\'s all product. We do have, as I said earlier, a very positive product mix related to processor side of the business, so the client, the server as well as the data center GPUs. We are helped somewhat by the fact that semi-custom is down, but I would say the much larger piece of that is the product-related growth in new products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So is this the new floor, Lisa? Or is it too hard to tell?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I don\\'t know if I would say it\\'s the new floor. I would say that we\\'re very pleased that we\\'re at the lower end of our long-term guidance. And certainly, we\\'ll see what the puts and takes are as we go from a quarterly standpoint into 2019. But on a full year basis in 2018, I think Devinder mentioned this in his prepared remarks, we\\'re now over 38%, and we\\'ve really grown margins every quarter over the last number of quarters. And we\\'re happy with that. I think that\\'s the strength of the model. We\\'ve always said that the strength of the model is improving the product mix, and I think that\\'s what we see here today.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn William Pitzer,  Cr\\\\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then Lisa, I apologize if I missed it, but just relative to your Q4 guidance, given some of the capacity issues that your competitor is having, is there any share gain -- incremental share gain assumptions based upon shortage of CPUs? Is that something that should be a tailwind in Q4? Or does that take longer, it might be something we don\\'t see in sort of calendar first quarter? Any commentary around that would be helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we do see some pockets of shortages. We are ramping up production. I do believe we see some incremental benefit here in the fourth quarter, but I don\\'t want to take away from the fact that we have a strong portfolio and we have a lot of platforms ramping. So the client business was always going to be up for us in Q4. And are we benefiting a bit from, let\\'s call it, some of the pockets of shortages? Perhaps.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have 2 as well, if I can. I wanted to go into the semi-custom segment, and we\\'ve talked about kind of an elongated or near the end of the life from some of these gaming platforms. I\\'m just kind of curious as how you guys think about that piece of the business as we start to look into 2019? And is there a point in time where we can start to kind of think about product cycles as driving reacceleration of growth in that segment?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, sure. So again, without commenting on any specific design wins, what I would say is in 2019, we will be in the seventh year of the game console cycle. And so we do expect it to be down. And if you look at the cycles, you\\'ll see that it\\'s very consistent with previous cycles. When we look forward, when I look at what happens beyond 2019, I like our semi-custom business. I think it\\'s a good business for us. I think it continues to be a place where we differentiate ourselves because of our ability to customize for various customers. And I do see it growing again beyond 2019, and it will continue to be an important part of our business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then on the channel inventory dynamic, there\\'s a lot of kind of moving parts right now in the market. And we\\'ve seen, obviously, with the U.S.-China tariff situation, there\\'s then some questions around demand pull-forward or any kind of element around the tariff situation that\\'s impacted demand. I\\'m just curious, have you seen anything from your customers that have suggested that there\\'s any -- been any kind of sort of demand pull-forward and any effects on your business as it relates to U.S.-China especially as we start to look into next year, the potential for increased tariffs further?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So we\\'re monitoring the tariff situation very closely. There\\'s a lot of activity around that. I would say from what we see today, we don\\'t see anything material as it relates to the tariffs, whether it\\'s pull-ins or just the overall impact of tariffs. But we are doing quite a bit to adjust our supply chain, as I\\'m sure many others are. So we already had a supply chain that was highly multi-sourced, and so that\\'s very helpful. And we\\'re adjusting our supply chain to ensure that we have further options such that the tariffs are not a significant impact on our business.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the weakness in the channel-based GPUs, I\\'m just wondering if some of the weakness is due to the gaming bans in China. It looks like China is hindering the introduction of new games, but I\\'m not sure if it\\'s impacting actual GPU sales and sort of the enthusiast gamers\\' motivation to kind of move up the stack?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I don\\'t think we see that specifically, Harlan. I think what we\\'re seeing is more -- just we had very strong demand in the first half of this year. And as the supply chain build up, we\\'re just seeing some excess inventory that needs to be worked through right now. We\\'re not seeing anything specific relative to that China issue you mentioned.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Thanks for the insight there. And then on the Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, now that they\\'re not going to be supporting 7-nanometer, you\\'ll be moving, I think, most of your 7-nanometer client products to TSMC, and as of right now, I think you guys still need to pay them a fee for every 7-nanometer product you produce at TSMC, can you just give us an update on the new Wafer Supply Agreement that doesn\\'t include 7-nanometers? Obviously, this should be beneficial for your gross margins.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So look, GLOBALFOUNDRIES is a good partner. They continue to be a very important partner for us. We are in discussions with them about how to update our agreement post their strategy updates. And we\\'re making good progress on that. So we\\'ll give you more detail as we get closer. But overall, they -- GLOBALFOUNDRIES continues to be an important partner for us.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Just a question to follow up on that THATIC, the $86 million. My understanding is you had original agreement, you were getting an OpEx off that, and then eventually, if there was product revenue, you\\'d recognize that revenue with your portion of your ownership on those wafers. So I\\'m just kind of curious, what\\'s this $86 million? Is it additional IP? And any color on as to what it\\'s for, if possible.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [73]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Blayne. So it is related to some additional IP with THATIC. And we\\'ve completed some technology milestones in this past quarter, and so that\\'s what that was.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [74]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got you. And then I want to ask you -- it\\'s well known that there is graphics inventory. You mentioned that graphics pricing was down. I\\'m just kind of curious of your expectation for that discounting as we get into the end of the year here. What have you seen and what are you expecting as you look into December?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. We\\'re not expecting any significant changes from an ASP standpoint if that\\'s what you\\'re asking. I think what we see is the inventory just has to be worked through, and it\\'s working through the system.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our final question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [77]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I did join a little bit late. So I do apologize if you addressed this. Lisa, I just had a question on the client CPU business and how you think about market share versus profitability going forward. Given some of the shortages near term, I\\'m sure you have the opportunity to pick up share if you wanted to but perhaps at a lower gross margin. So as you think about the client business over the next year or 2, how do you balance market share versus profitability?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [78]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure, so the client business is a good business for us from a margin standpoint. And as we look forward, we look at it as an end-to-end portfolio. So -- and we really do have an end-to-end portfolio across notebook and desktop. And our goal is continue to improve the profitability of that business. \\\\nAs it relates to unit share, I think unit share is certainly important. We look at revenue growth overall as important for that business, but I believe we\\'ll be able to do that at good margins and continue on our margin path.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [79]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thank you. We\\'ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\\'d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLaura A.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Simona. Q1 revenue was $2.2 billion, in line with our outlook and down 31% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.05 billion was down 39% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially, consistent with our expectations. We are pleased with the initial ramp of Turing and the reduction of inventory in the channel. During the quarter, we filled out our Turing lineup with the launch of midrange GeForce products that enable us to delight gamers with the best performance at every price point starting at $149. New product launches this quarter included the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 1660 and 1650, which bring Turing to the high-volume PC gaming segment for both desktop and laptop. These GPUs deliver up to 50% performance improvement over their Pascal-based predecessors, leveraging new share innovations such as concurrent floating point and integer operations, a unified cache and Adaptive Shading, all with the incredibly power-efficient architecture.\\\\nWe expect continued growth in the gaming laptops this year. GeForce gaming laptops are one of the shining spots of the consumer PC market. This year, OEMs have built a record of nearly 100 GeForce gaming laptops. GeForce laptops start at $799 and all the way up to an amazing GeForce RTX 2080 4K laptops that are more powerful than even next-generation consoles.\\\\nThe content ecosystem for ray-traced games is gaining significant momentum. At the March Game Developers Conference, ray-tracing sessions were packed. Support for ray tracing was announced by the industry\\'s most important game engines, Microsoft DXR, Epic\\'s Unreal Engine and Unity. Ray tracing will be the standard for next-generation games.\\\\nIn March, at our GPU Technology Conference, we also announced more details on our cloud gaming strategies through our GeForce NOW service and the newly announced GFN Alliance. GeForce NOW is a GeForce gaming PC in the cloud for the 1 billion PCs that are not game-ready, expanding our reach well beyond today\\'s 200 million GeForce gamers. It\\'s an open platform that allows gamers to play the games they own instantly in the cloud on any PC or Mac anywhere they like. The service currently has 300,000 monthly active users with 1 million more on the waitlist.\\\\nTo scale out to millions of gamers worldwide, we announced the GeForce NOW Alliance, expanding GFN through partnerships with the global telecom providers. Softbank in Japan and LG Uplus in South Korea will be among the first to launch GFN later this year. NVIDIA will develop the software and manage the service and share the subscription revenue with alliance partners. GFN runs on NVIDIA\\'s edge computing servers. As telcos race to offer the new services for their 5G network, GFN is an ideal new 5G application.\\\\nMoving to data center. Revenue was $634 million, down 10% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially, reflecting the pause in hyperscale spending. While demand from some hyperscale customers bounced back nicely, others paused or cut back. Despite the uneven demand drop -- backdrop, the quarter had significant positives consistent with the growth drivers we outlined on our previous earnings call. First, inference revenue was up sharply both year-on-year and sequentially with broad-based adoption across a number of hyperscale and consumer Internet companies. As announced at GTC, Amazon and Alibaba joined other hyperscalers such as Google, Baidu and Tencent in adopting the T4 in their data centers. A growing list of consumer Internet companies is also adapting our GPUs for inference, including LinkedIn, Expedia, Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter. The contribution of inference to our data center revenue is now well into the double-digit percent. \\\\nSecond, we expanded our reach in enterprise, teaming up with major OEMs to introduce the T4 enterprise and edge computing servers. These are optimized to run the NVIDIA CUDA-X AI acceleration libraries for AI and data analytics. With an easy-to-deploy software stack from NVIDIA and our ecosystem partners, this wave of NVIDIA edge AI computing systems enables companies in the world\\'s largest industries, transportation, manufacturing, industrial, retail, health care and agricultural, to bring intelligence to the edge where the customers operate.\\\\nAnd third, we made significant progress in data center rendering and graphics. We unveiled a new RTX Server configuration packing 40 GPUs into an 8 use case and up to 32 servers in a pod, providing unparalleled density, efficiency and scalability. With a complete stack, this server design is optimized for 3 data center graphic workloads: rendering, remote workstations and cloud gaming. The rendering opportunity is starting to take shape with early RTX Server deployments at leading studios, including Disney, Pixar and Weta.\\\\nIn the quarter, we announced our pending acquisition of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion, which we believe will strengthen our strategic position in data center. Once complete, the acquisition will unite 2 of the world\\'s leading companies in high-performance computing. Together, NVIDIA\\'s computing platform and Mellanox\\'s interconnects power over 250 of the world\\'s TOP500 supercomputer and have as customers every major cloud service provider and computer maker.\\\\nData centers in the future will be architected as giant compute engines with tens of thousands of compute nodes designed holistically with their interconnects for optimal performance. With Mellanox, NVIDIA will optimize data center scale workloads across the entire computing, networking and storage stack to achieve higher performance, greater utilization and lower operating cost for customers. Together, we can create better AI computing systems for the cloud to enterprise to the edge. As stated at the time of the announcement, we look forward to closing the acquisition by the end of this calendar year.\\\\nMoving to pro visualization. Revenue reached $266 million, up 6% from the prior year and down 9% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by both desktop and mobile workstations, while the sequential decline was largely seasonal. Areas of strength included the public sector, oil and gas and manufacturing. Emerging applications, such as AI, AR, VR, contributed an estimated 38% of pro visualization revenue.\\\\nThe real-time ray-tracing capabilities of RTX are a game changer for the visual effects industry, and we are seeing tremendous momentum in the ecosystem. At GTC, we announced that the world\\'s top 3D application providers have adopted NVIDIA RTX in their product releases set for later this year, including Adobe, Autodesk, Chaos Group, Dassault and Pixar. With this rich software ecosystem, NVIDIA RTX is transforming the 3D market. For example, Pixar is using NVIDIA RTX ray tracing on its upcoming films. Weta Digital is using it for upcoming Disney projects and Siemens NX ray-traced studios users will be able to generate rendered images up to 4x faster in their product design workloads. We are excited to see the tremendous value that NVIDIA RTX is bringing to the millions of creators and designers served by ecosystem partners.\\\\nFinally, turning to automotive. Q1 revenue was $166 million, up 14% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by growing adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development deals. At GTC, we had major customer and product announcements. Toyota selected NVIDIA\\'s end-to-end platform to develop, train and validate self-driving vehicles. This broad partnership includes advancements in AI computing, infrastructure using NVIDIA GPUs, simulation using NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation platform and in-car AV computers based on the DRIVE AGX Xavier or Pegasus. We also announced the public availability of DRIVE Constellation, which enables millions of miles to be driven in virtual worlds across the broad range of scenarios with greater efficiency, cost effectiveness and safety than what\\'s possible to achieve in the real world. Constellation will be reported in our data center market platform.\\\\nAnd we introduced NVIDIA Safety Force Field, a computational defensive driving framework that shields autonomous vehicles from collisions. Mathematically verified and validated in simulation, Safety Force Field will prevent a vehicle from creating, escalating or contributing to an unsafe driving situation. We continue to believe that every vehicle will have an autonomous capability one day, whether with a driver or driverless. To help make that vision a reality, NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to simulation to in-car computing. And Toyota is our first major win that validates this strategy. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025.\\\\nMoving to the rest of the P&L and balance sheet. Q1 GAAP gross margin was 58.4% and non-GAAP was 59%, down year-on-year to lower gaming margins and mix, up sequentially from Q4, which had $128 million charge from DRAM boards and other components. GAAP operating expenses were $938 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $753 million, up 21% and 16% year-on-year, respectively. We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020 while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars.\\\\nGAAP EPS was $0.64, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.88. We did not make any stock repurchases in the quarter. Following the announcement of the pending Mellanox acquisition, we remain committed to returning $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and repurchases. So far, we have returned $800 million through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.\\\\nWith that, let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. While we anticipate substantial quarter-over-quarter growth, our Q2 outlook is somewhat lower than our expectations earlier in the quarter where our outlook for fiscal 2020 revenue was flat to down slightly from fiscal 2019. The data center spending pause around the world will likely persist in the second quarter, and visibility remains low. In gaming, the CPU shortages while improving will affect the initial ramp of our laptop business.\\\\nFor Q2, we expect revenue to be $2.55 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect a stronger second half than the first half, and we are returning to our practice of providing revenue outlook one quarter at a time. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.2% and 59.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $985 million, $765 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $120 million to $140 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.\\\\nIn closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We\\'ll be presenting at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5, at the RBC Future of Mobility Conference on June 6 and at the NASDAQ investor conference on June 13. Our next earnings call to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 will take place on August 15.\\\\nWe will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Colette, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color or discussion around what exactly you\\'ve seen in the data center segment and whether or not or what you\\'re looking for in terms of signs that we can kind of return to growth or maybe this pause is behind us. I guess what I\\'m really asking is kind of what\\'s changed over the last, let\\'s call it, 3 months relative to your prior commentary from a visibility perspective and just demand perspective within that segment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thanks for the question as we start out here. I think when we had discussed our overall data center business 3 months ago, we did indicate that our visibility as we turned into the new calendar year was low. We had a challenge in terms of completing some of the deals at the end of that quarter. As we moved into Q1, I think we felt solid in terms of how we completed. We saw probably a combination of those moving forward continuing with their CapEx expenditures and building out in terms of what they need for the data centers. Some others are still in terms of the pause.\\\\nSo as we look in terms of with Q2, I think we see a continuation of what we have in terms of the visibility, not the best visibility going forward but still rock-solid to what we think are benefits of what we provide in terms of a platform. Our overall priorities are aligned to what we see with the hyperscalers as well as the enterprises as they think about using AI in so many of their different workloads. But we\\'ll just have to see as we go forward how this turns out. But right now, visibility probably just remains the same about as where we were when we started 3 months ago.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then as a quick follow-up on the gaming side, last quarter, you talked about that being down -- I think it was termed as being down slightly for the full year. Is that still the expectation? Or how has that changed?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So at this time, we don\\'t plan on giving a full year overall guidance. I think our look in terms of gaming, all of the drivers that we thought about earlier in the quarter and we talked about on our Investor Day and we have continued to talk about are still definitely in line. The drivers of our gaming business and Turing RTX for the future are still on track, but we\\'re not providing guidance at this time for the full year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the last earnings call, you\\'d mentioned China gaming demand as a headwind. At the Analyst Day in mid-March, I think Jensen had mentioned that the team was already starting to see better demand trends out of China maybe given the relaxed stance on gaming bans. Do you anticipate continued China gaming demand on a go-forward basis? And maybe talk about some of the dynamics driving that demand profile in the China geography.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. China looks fine. I think China has stabilized. The gaming market in China is really vibrant, and it continues to be vibrant. Tencent\\'s releasing new games. I think you might have heard that Epic stores now are open in Asia, and games are available from the West. So there are all kinds of positive signs in China. There are some 300 million PC gamers in China, and people are expecting it to grow. We\\'re expecting the total number of gamers to continue to grow from the 1-plus billion PC gamers around the world to something more than that. And so things look fine.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHarlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And then as a follow-up, a big part of the demand profile in the second half of the year for the gaming business is always the lineup of AAA-rated games. Obviously, you guys have a very close partnership with all of the game developers. How does the pipeline of new games look? Kind of they get launched October, November time frame, either total number of blockbuster games and also games supporting real-time ray tracing as well as some of your DLSS capabilities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Well, it\\'s seasonal. Second half of the year, we expect to see some great games. We won\\'t preannounce anybody else\\'s games for them, but this is a great PC cycle because it\\'s the end of the console cycle, and PCs is just where the action\\'s at these days with battle royale and eSports and so much social going on, the PC gaming ecosystem is just really vibrant. Our strategy with RTX was to take a lead and move the world to ray tracing. And at this point, it\\'s fairly, fairly safe to say that the leadership position that we\\'ve taken has turned into a movement that has turned next-generation gaming ray tracing into a standard. Almost every single game platform will have to have ray tracing, and some of them already announced it.\\\\nAnd the partnerships that we\\'ve developed are fantastic. Microsoft DXR is supporting ray tracing. Unity is supporting ray tracing. Epic is supporting ray tracing. Leading publishers like EA has adopted RTX and supporting ray tracing. And movie studios, Pixar has adopted -- announced that they\\'re using RTX and will use RTX to accelerate their rendering of films. And so Adobe and Autodesk jumped on top -- jumped onto RTX and will bring ray tracing to their content and their tools. And so I think at this point, it\\'s fair to say that ray tracing is the next generation and is going to be adopted all over the world.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess the first question is for Colette. So what went into the decision to pull full year guidance versus just cutting it? Is it really to see around how long it could take for data center to come back?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I\\'ll start off here and kind of go back to where our thoughts were in Q1 and why we provided full year guidance when we were in Q1. When we looked at Q1 and what we were guiding, we understood that it was certainly an extraordinary quarter, something that we didn\\'t feel was a true representative of our business, and we wanted to get a better view of our trajectory of our business in terms of going forward.\\\\nWe are still experiencing, I think, the uncertainty as a result of the pause in terms of with the overall hyperscale data centers. And we do believe that\\'s going to extend into Q2. However, we do know and expect that our Q2 -- or excuse me, our H2 will likely be sizably larger than our overall H1, and the core dynamics of our business at every level is exactly what we expected. Just that said though, we\\'re going to return to just quarterly guidance at this time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTimothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you give us some even qualitative, if not quantitative, sense of the $320 million incremental revenue for July, how that breaks out? Is the thinking sort of that data center is going to be flat to maybe up a little bit and pretty much the remainder of the growth comes from gaming?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So when you think about our growth between Q1 and Q2, yes, we do expect in terms of our gaming to increase. We do expect our Nintendo Switch to start again in sizable amounts once we move into Q2, and we do at this time expect probably our data center business to grow.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, I had a follow-up on the data center business. I was hoping you could provide some color in terms of what you\\'re seeing not only from your hyperscale customers, which you\\'ve talked extensively on, but more on the enterprise and HP side of your business and specifically on the hyperscale side. You guys talked about this pause that you\\'re seeing from your customer base. When you\\'re having conversations with your customers, do they give you a reason as to why they\\'re pausing? Is it too much inventory of GPUs and CPUs and so on and so forth? Or is it optimization giving them extra capacity? Is it caution on their own business going forward? Or is it a combination of all the above? Any color on that would be helpful, too.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Hyperscalers are digesting the capacity they have. They -- at this point, I think it\\'s fairly clear that in the second half of last year, they took on a little bit too much capacity. And so everybody has paused to give themselves a chance to digest. However, our business on inference is doing great, and we\\'re working with CSPs all over the world to accelerate their inference models.\\\\nNow the reason why recently the inference activity has gotten just off the charts is because of breakthroughs in what we call conversational AI. In fact, today, I think that -- I just saw it today, but I\\'ve known about this work for some time, Harry Shum\\'s group, Microsoft AI research group, today announced their multitask DNN general language understanding model. And it just -- it broke benchmark records all over the place. And basically, what this means is the 3 fundamental components of conversational AI, which is speech recognition; natural language understanding, which does multitask DNN is a breakthrough, and it\\'s based on a piece of work that Google did recently called BERT; and then text-to-speech. All of the major pieces of a conversational AI are now put together.\\\\nOf course, it\\'s going to continue to evolve, but these models are gigantic to train. And in the case of Microsoft\\'s network, it was trained Volta GPUs, And these systems require large amounts of memory. The models are enormous. It takes an enormous amount of time to train these systems. And so we\\'re seeing a breakthrough in conversational AI. And across the board, internet companies would like to make their AI much more conversational, so that you can access your phones and smart speakers and be able to engage AI practically everywhere.\\\\nThe work that we\\'re doing in the industries makes a ton of sense. We\\'re seeing AI adoption in just about all the industries from transportation to health care to retail to logistics, industrials, agriculture. And the reason for that is because they have a vast amount of data that they\\'re collecting. And I heard a statistics just the other day from a talk that Satya gave that some 90% of today\\'s data was created just 2 years ago and is being created by and gathered by these industrial systems all over the world.\\\\nAnd so if you want to put that data to work -- and you could create the models using our systems, our GPUs for training, and then you can extend that all the way out to the edge. This last quarter, we started to talk about our enterprise server based on T4. This inference engine that has been really successful for us at the CSPs is now going out into the edge, and we call them edge servers and enterprise servers. And these edge systems are going to do AI basically instantaneously. It\\'s too much data to move all the way to the cloud. You might have data sovereignty concerns. You want to have very, very low latency. Maybe it needs to have multi-sensor fusion capabilities so it understands the context better. For example, what it sees and what it hears has to be harmonious. And so you need that kind of AI, those kind of sensor computing at the edge.\\\\nAnd so we\\'re seeing a ton of excitement around this area. Some people call it intelligent edge, some people call it edge computing. And now with 5G networks coming, we\\'re seeing a lot of interest around the edge computing servers that we\\'re making. And so those are the activities that we\\'re seeing.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          As a quick follow-up on the gaming site, Colette, can you characterize product mix within gaming? You saw in the current quarter -- you cited mix is one of the key reasons why gross margins were down year-over-year, albeit off a high base. Going into Q2 in the back half, would you expect SKU mix within gaming to improve or stay the same? I asked because it\\'s important for gross margins obviously.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, when you look at our sequential gross margin increase, that will be influenced by our larger revenue -- our larger revenue and better mix, which you are correct, is our largest driver of our overall gross margin. However, we will be beginning the Nintendo Switch backup, and that does have lower gross margins than the company average, influencing therefore Q2 gross margin guidance that we had provided. As we look forward towards the rest of the year, we think mix and the higher revenue again will influence and likely rise our overall gross margins for the full year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          You talked quite a bit about GeForce NOW in the prepared remarks and at the Analyst Day. It seems like cloud gaming is going to be a big topic at E3. Is that going to be your preferred way to go to market with cloud gaming? And do you expect to sell GPUs to sort of traditional cloud vendors in non-GeForce NOW fashion?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Our strategy for cloud gaming is to extend our PC position for GeForce gamers into the cloud, and our strategy for building out our network is partnerships with telcos around the world. And so we\\'ll build out some of it. And on top of the service, we have our entire PC gaming stack. And when we host the service, we\\'ll move to a subscription model. And with our telcos around the world who would like to provision the service at their edge servers, and many of them would like to do so in conjunction with our 5G telco services to offer cloud gaming as a differentiator. And all of these different countries where PC exposure has been relatively low, we have an opportunity to extend our platform out to that billion PC gamers. And so that\\'s our basic strategy.\\\\nWe also offer our edge server platform to all of the cloud service providers. Google has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud, amazon has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud and Microsoft has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud. And these GPUs will be fantastic also for cloud gaming and workstation graphics and also ray tracing. And so the platform is capable of running all of the things that NVIDIA runs, and we try to put it in every data center, in every cloud from every region that\\'s possible.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I actually had a clarification for Colette and a question for Jensen. Colette, are you now satisfied that the PC gaming business is operating at a normal level when you look at the Q2 guidance? Like are all the issues regarding inventory and other issues, are they over? Or do you think that the second half of the year is more the normalized run rate for your PC gaming business?\\\\nAnd then Jensen, on the data center, NVIDIA has dominated the training market. Inference sounds a lot more fragmented and competitive. There\\'s a lot of talk of software being like more at the framework level. How should we get the confidence that your lead in training will help you maintain a good lead in inference also?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks for the question. So let\\'s start with your first part of the question regarding how we reach overall normalized gaming levels. When we look at our overall inventory in the channel, we believe that this is relatively behind us and moving forward that it will not be an issue. Going forward, we will probably reach normalized level for gaming somewhere between Q2 and Q3 similar to our discussion that we had back at Analyst Day, at the beginning of the quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          NVIDIA\\'s strategy is accelerated computing. It is very different than an accelerator strategy. For example, if you were building a smart microphone, you need an accelerator for speech recognition, ASR. Our company is focused on accelerated computing, and the reason for that is because the world\\'s body of software is really gigantic, and the world\\'s body of software continues to evolve. And AI is nowhere near done. We\\'re probably at the first or a couple of innings of AI at that. And so the amount of the software and the size of the models are going to have to continue to evolve.\\\\nOur accelerated computing platform is designed to enable the computer industry to bring forward into the future all the software that exists today, whether it\\'s TensorFlow or Caffe or PyTorch or it could be classical machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, which is actually right now the most popular framework and machine learning overall. And there\\'s so many different types of classical algorithms and not to mention all of the handwritten engineered algorithms by programmers. And those algorithms and those hand-engineered algorithms also would like to be mixed in with all of the deep learning or otherwise classical machine learning algorithms.\\\\nThis whole body of software doesn\\'t run on a single function accelerator. If you would like that body of software to run on something, it would have to be sufficiently general purpose. And so the balance that we made was we invented this thing called a Tensor Core that allows us to accelerate deep learning to the speed of light. Meanwhile, it has the flexibility of CUDA so that we can bring forward everything in classical machine learning as people have started to see with RAPIDS and is being announced, being integrated into machine learning pipelines, in the cloud and elsewhere, and then also all of the high-performance computing applications or computer vision algorithms, image processing algorithms that don\\'t have deep learning or machine learning alternatives. And so our company is focused on accelerated computing.\\\\nAnd speaking of inference, that\\'s one of the reasons why we\\'re so successful in inference right now. We\\'re seeing really great pickup. And the reason for that is because the type of models that people want to run on one application, and let\\'s just use one application, one very, very exciting one, conversational AI, you would have to do speech recognition. You would have to then do natural language understanding to understand what the speech is. You might have to convert -- you have to translate to another language. Then you have to do something related to maybe making a recommendation or making a search. And then after that, you have to convert that recommendation and search and the intent into speech. While some of it could be 8-bit integers, some of it really wants to be 16-bit floating point. And some of it because of development state of it may want to be in 32-bit floating point. And so the mixed precision nature and the computational algorithm nature or flexibility nature of our approach make it possible for cloud providers and people who are developing AI applications to not have to worry about exactly what model it runs or not. We run every single model. And if it doesn\\'t currently run, we\\'ll help you make it run.\\\\nAnd so the flexibility of our architecture and the incredible performance in deep learning is really a great balance and allows customers to deploy it easily. So our strategy is very different than an accelerator. I think the only accelerators that I really see successful at the moment are the ones that go into smart speakers. And surely, there are a whole bunch being talked about, but I think the real challenge is how to make it run real, real workloads. And we\\'re going to keep cranking along in our current strategy and keep raising the bar as we have in the past.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is a question for Colette. Colette, so you said inference and rendering within data center were both up very strongly. But I guess that has to imply that like the training/acceleration pieces is quite weak, even weaker than the overall. And given those should be adding to efficiency, I\\'m just surprised it\\'s down that much. I mean is this truly just digestion? I mean is it share? I mean like your competitor is now shipping some parts here. I mean I guess how do we get confidence that just we haven\\'t seen the ceiling on this? I mean do you think given the trajectory, you can exit the year above the prior peaks? I guess you kind of have to given at least the qualitative outlook in the second -- I guess maybe just any color you can give us on any of those trends would be super helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. As we discussed, Stacy, we are seeing many of the hyperscalers definitely purchasing in terms of the inferencing into the installment that it continues, also in terms of the training instances that they will need for their cloud or for internal use absolutely. But we have some that have paused and are going through those periods. So that -- we do believe this will come back. We do believe as we look out into the future that they will need that overall deep learning for much of their research as well as many of their workloads. So no concern on that, but right now, we do see a pause. I\\'ll turn it over to Jensen to see if he has any additional comments.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let\\'s see. I think that when it comes down to training, if your infrastructure team tells you not to buy anything, the thing that suffers is time to market and some amount of experimentation that allows you to get better comps and waiting longer. And I think that for computer vision type of algorithms and recommendation type of algorithms, those -- that posture may not be impossible. However, the type of work that everybody is now jumping on top of, which is natural language understanding and conversational AI and the breakthrough that Microsoft just announced, if you want to keep up with that, you\\'re going to have to buy much, much larger machines. And I\\'m looking forward to that, and I expect that that\\'s going to happen. But in the latter part of last year, Q4 and Q1 of this year, we did see pause from the hyperscalers and -- but I don\\'t expect it to last.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. Just as a quick follow-up, I just wanted to ask about the regulatory around Mellanox in the context of what we\\'re seeing out of China now. How do we sort of gauge the risk of, I guess, potential for the deterioration in relationships sort of spilling over on the regulatory front around that deal? We\\'ve seen that obviously with some of the other large deals in the space. What are your thoughts on that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, on first principles, the acquisition is going to enable data centers around the world, whether it\\'s U.S. or elsewhere in China, to be able to advance much, much more quickly. We\\'re going to invest and building infrastructure technology. And as a combined company, we\\'ll be able to do that much better. And so this is good for customers, and it\\'s great for customers in China. The 2 matters, whether it\\'s -- the 2 matters that we\\'re talking about are just -- are different. And one is related to competition in a -- with respect to our acquisition, the competition in the market, and the other one is related to trade. And so the 2 matters are just different. And in our particular case, we bring so much value to the marketplace in China, and I\\'m confident that the market will see that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I guess a question on the noncloud part of your data center business. So if you think about the trends you\\'re seeing in enterprise virtualization, in HPC and all the work you\\'re doing around RAPIDS, rendering, et cetera, can you kind of talk through the visibility you have today for that part of your business? I think that\\'s roughly 50% of the mix. So is that a piece that you feel confident you can grow in 2019? And any color around that would be appreciated.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          We expected to grow in 2019. The -- a lot of our T4 inference work is related to what people call edge computing. And it has to be done at the edge because of the amount of data that otherwise would be transferred to the cloud is just too much. It has to be done at the edge because of data sovereignty issues and data privacy issues. And it has to be done at the edge because the latency requirement is really, really high. It has to respond basically like a reflex and to make a prediction or make a suggestion or stop a piece of machinery instantaneously. And so a lot of that work, a lot of the work that we\\'re doing in T4 inference is partly in the cloud, a lot of it is at the edge.\\\\nT4 servers for enterprise were announced, I guess, about halfway through the quarter. And the OEMs are super excited about that because the number of companies in the world who want to do data analytics, predictive analytics is quite large, and the size of the data is growing so significantly. And with Moore\\'s Law ending, it\\'s really hard to power through terabytes of data at a time. And so we\\'ve been working on building the software stack from the new memory architectures and storage architectures all the way to the computational middleware, and it\\'s called RAPIDS. And I appreciate you saying that, and that\\'s being put together. And the activity in GitHub is just fantastic. And so you can see all kinds of companies jumping in to make contributions because they would like to be able to take that open-source software and run it in their own data center on our GPUs. And so I expect the enterprise side of our business, both for enterprise big data analytics or for edge computing, to be a really good growth driver for us this year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And a follow-up real quickly on auto. It\\'s a business that you talked about, more R&D focused, but clearly I think has surprised positively. What\\'s the visibility like there? And how should we think about growth trajectory into the second half of the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Our automotive strategy has several components. There\\'s the engineering component of it where we -- our engineers and their engineers have to codevelop the autonomous vehicles. And then there\\'s 3 other components. There\\'s the component of AI computing infrastructure we call DGX and/or any of the OEM service that include our GPUs that are used for developing the AIs. The cars are collecting a couple of terabytes per day per test car, and all of that data has to be powered through and crunched through in the data center. And so we have an infrastructure of what we call DGX that people could use, and we\\'re seeing a lot of success there.\\\\nWe just announced this last quarter, a new infrastructure called Constellation that lets you essentially drive thousands and thousands of test cars in your data center, and they\\'re all going through pseudo-directed random or directed scenarios that allows you to either test untestable scenarios or regress against previous scenarios, and we call that Constellation. And then lastly, after working on a car for several years, we would install the computer inside the car, and we call that DRIVE.\\\\nAnd so these are the 4 components of opportunities that we have in the automotive industry. We\\'re doing great in China. There\\'s a whole bunch of electric vehicles being created. The robotaxis\\' developments around the world largely use NVIDIA\\'s technology. We recently announced the partnership with Toyota. There\\'s a whole bunch of stuff that we\\'re working on, and I\\'m anxious to announce them to you.\\\\nBut this is an area that is the tip of the iceberg of a larger space we call robotics and computing at the edge. But if you think about the basic computational pipeline of a self-driving car, it\\'s no different essentially than a smart retail or the future of computational medical instruments, agriculture, industrial inspection, delivery drones, all basically use essentially the same technique. And so this is the foundational work that we\\'re going to do for a larger space that people call the intelligent edge or computing at the edge.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First question is on notebooks and just to clarify what\\'s been different from your expectations this year. Is it simply that the OEMs didn\\'t launch the new models you\\'d expected given the shortage? Or is it more just about unit volume? And then just following up on that, what\\'s your level of confidence in that coming back to be a driver as you go into the second half of the year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          In Q2, we were -- we had to deal with some CPU shortage issues at the OEMs. It\\'s improving, but the initial ramp will be affected. And so the CPU shortage situation has been described fairly broadly, and it affected our initial ramp. We don\\'t expect it to affect our ramp going forward. And the new category of gaming notebooks that we created called Max-Q has made it possible for really amazing gaming performance to fit into a thin and light. And these new generations of notebooks with our Max-Q design and the Turing GPU, which is super energy efficient, in combination, made it possible for OEMs to create notebooks that are both affordable all the way down to $799, thin and really delightful, all the way up to something incredible with RTX 2080 and a 4K display. And these are thin notebooks that are really beautiful that people would love to use.\\\\nAnd this -- the invention of the Max-Q design method and all the software that went into it that we announced last year, we had -- I think last year, we had some 40 notebooks or so, maybe a little bit less than that. And this year, we have some 100 notebooks that are being designed at different price segments by different OEMs across different regions. And so I think this year is going to be quite a successful year for notebooks. And it\\'s also the most successful segment of consumer PCs. It\\'s the fastest-growing segment. It is very largely underpenetrated because until Max-Q came along, it wasn\\'t really possible to design a notebook that is both great in performance and experience and also something that a gamer would like to own. And so finally, we\\'ve been able to solve that difficult puzzle and created powerful gaming machines that are inside a notebook that\\'s really wonderful to own and carry around.\\\\nAnd so this is going to be a really -- this is a fast-growing segment, and all the OEMs know it. And that\\'s why they put so much energy into creating all these different types of designs and styles and sizes and shapes. And we have 100 Turing GPU notebooks, gaming PCs ramping right now.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          That\\'s very helpful. As a follow-up, I just want to follow up on some of the previous questions on the automotive market. And we\\'ve been talking about it for a while. Obviously, the design cycles are very long, so you do have some visibility, and I guess the question is when can we expect an acceleration of auto revenue. Is next year the year? And then what will be the driver of that in terms of dollar contribution? I presume some of the Level 2+ things you\\'ve been talking about would probably mean most likely they\\'re given the amount of volume there. If you can confirm that and just give some color on expectations for drivers.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. Level 2+, call it 2020, late 2021 or like 2022-ish. So that\\'s Level 2+. I would say 2019, very, very early for robotaxis; next year, substantially more volume for robotaxis; 2021, bigger volumes for robotaxis. The ASP differences, the amount of computation you put into a robotaxi because of sensor resolutions, sensor diversity and redundancy, the computational redundancy and the richness of the algorithm, all of it put together, it\\'s probably an order of magnitude plus in computation. And so the economics would reflect that. And so that robotaxi is kind of like next year, the year after, ramp. And then think of Level 2+ as 2021, 2022.\\\\nOverall, remember that our economics come from 4 different parts. And so there\\'s the NRE components of it, there\\'s the AI development infrastructure, computing infrastructure part of it, the simulation part of it called Constellation and then the economics of the car. And so we just announced Constellation. The enthusiasm around it is really great. Nobody should ever ship anything they don\\'t simulate. And my expectation is that billions of miles will get simulated inside a simulator long before they\\'ll ship it. And so that\\'s a great opportunity for Constellation.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And the next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I have a few questions, one for Jensen and one for Colette. I guess, Jensen, you\\'ve done -- you said in many forums that the move down to the new process node at 7-nanometer across the business was not really sufficient to have a platform approach, and I agree with that. But maybe you could talk a little bit about your product plans at least in general terms around a 7-nanometer franchise in the gaming business and also in your training accelerator program. And I wonder if that might be waiting for some of those products or at least anticipation of those might be the cause of a little bit of a pause here.\\\\nAnd secondly, Colette, maybe you could talk us through your expectations. I understand there\\'s a lack of visibility in certain parts of the business on revenue, but maybe you could talk about OpEx trends through the rest of the year where you might have a little more visibility.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The entire reason for Q4 and Q1 is attributed to oversupply in the channel as a result of cryptocurrency. It has nothing to do with Turing. In fact, Turing is off to a faster start than Pascal was, and it continues to be on a faster pace than Pascal was. And so the pause in gaming is now behind us. We\\'re in a growth trajectory with gaming. RTX has -- took the lead on ray tracing and has now become the standard for next-generation gaming, support from basically every major platform and software provider on the planet. And our notebook growth is going to be really great because of the Max-Q design that we invented. And the last couple of quarters would also intersect it with -- overlap with the seasonal slowdown that -- not sell but build -- the seasonal builds of the Nintendo Switch, and we\\'re going to go back to the normal build cycle.\\\\nAnd as Colette said earlier, somewhere between Q2 and Q3, we\\'ll get back to normal levels for gaming. And so we\\'re off to a great start in Turing, and I\\'m super excited about that. And in the second half of the year, we would have fully ramped up from top to bottom our Turing architecture, spanning everything from 179 to as high performance as you like. And we have the best price, best performance and best GPU at every single price point. And so I think we\\'re in a pretty good shape.\\\\nIn terms of process nodes, we tend to design our own process with TSMC. If you look at our process and you measure its energy efficiency, it\\'s off the charts. And in fact, if you take our Turing and you compare it against a 7-nanometer GPU on energy efficiency, it\\'s incomparable. In fact, the world\\'s 7-nanometer GPU already exists. And it\\'s easy to go and pull that and compare the performance and energy efficiency against one of our Turing GPUs. And so the real focus for our engineering team is to engineer a process that makes sense for us and to create an architecture that is energy efficient. And the combination of those 2 things allows us to sustain our leadership position. Otherwise, buying off the shelf process is something that we can surely do, but we want to do much more than that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Okay. And to discuss your question regarding OpEx trajectory for the rest of the year, we\\'re still on track to our thoughts on leaving the fiscal year with a year-over-year growth and overall OpEx on a non-GAAP basis in the high single digits. We\\'ll see probably an increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter along there, but our year-over-year growth will start to decline as we will not be growing at the speed that we did in this last year. But I do believe we\\'re on track to meet that goal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And I\\'ll now turn back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, everyone. We\\'re glad to be returning to growth. We are focused on driving 3 growth strategies. First, RTX ray tracing. It\\'s now clear that ray tracing is the future of gaming and digital design, and video RTX is leading the way. With the support of Microsoft DXR, Epic, Unity, Adobe and Autodesk, game publishers like EA, movie studios like Pixar, industry support has been fantastic.\\\\nSecond, accelerated computing and AI computing. The pause in hyperscale spending will pass. Accelerated computing in AI are the greatest forces in computing today, and NVIDIA is leading these movements. Whether cloud or enterprise or AI at the edge for 5G or industries, NVIDIA\\'s one scalable architecture from cloud to edge is the focal point platform for the industry to build AI upon.\\\\nThird, robotics. Some call it an embedded AI, some edge AI or autonomous machines. The same computing architecture is used for self-driving cars, pick-and-place robotics arms, delivery drones and smart retail stores. Everything machine -- every machine that moves or machines that watch other things that move, whether with driver or driverless, will have robotics and AI capabilities. Our strategy is to create an end-to-end platform that spans NVIDIA\\'s DGX AI computing infrastructure to NVIDIA Constellation simulation to NVIDIA AGX embedded AI computing.\\\\nAnd finally, we are super excited about the pending acquisition of Mellanox. Together, we can advance cloud and edge architectures for HPC and AI computing. See you next quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And this concludes today\\'s conference call.

Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Thanks, Shawn. NVIDIA continues to fire on all cylinders. We achieved strong revenue in each of our businesses. Data center revenue grew more than 2.5x, reflecting momentum behind artificial intelligence as we expanded our product portfolio and began shipping our new Volta platform. Overall, quarterly revenue reached a record $2.23 billion, up 56% from a year earlier, up 15% sequentially and well above our outlook of $1.95 billion. \\\\nFrom a reporting segment perspective, Q2 GPU revenue increased 59% to $1.9 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue doubled to $333 million. OEM revenue reached $251 million, reflecting sales of our cryptocurrency-specific GPUs, partially offset by the lapse in our licensing agreement with Intel. \\\\nLet\\'s start with our Gaming platform. Gaming revenue was $1.19 billion, up 52% year-on-year and up 15% from Q1. This reflects the vibrant Gaming ecosystem underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launched GPUs and other technologies, great games and growing interest in eSports. \\\\nGamers continue to love our Pascal-based GPUs, with demand remaining strong for GeForce GTX 10 Series products. Our new Max-Q design approach enabling Gaming notebooks that are thinner, lighter and faster is finding a strong market. Max-Q is being utilized in more than 20 new notebook models from a wide range of OEMs. Quality games continue to drive GPU sales. \\\\nAt the E3 Gaming expo in L.A., we showed the eagerly anticipated Destiny 2 running on 4K on PCs, which drew rave reviews. Major fall titles in addition to Destiny 2 include the new Call of Duty, World War II, Star Wars: Battlefront 2 and Middle-earth: Shadow of War. We\\'re also seeing the rise of independent titles that will become runaway hits, most notably, a new last-man-standing shooter called PlayerUnknown\\'s Battlegrounds.\\\\nGaming also continues to be driven by the surging popularity of eSports. This week\\'s biggest sporting event isn\\'t playing out at Dodger Stadium or Wrigley Field; it\\'s in Seattle at the International Dota 2 Championships. The $24 million in prize money is more than twice the purse of golf\\'s richest event, the US Open. For the third straight year, GeForce GTX is Dota 2\\'s official graphics platform. \\\\nGPU sales were lifted by demand from increasingly mining activity, or\\\\nEthereum. We served a large portion of this specialized market with a dedicated board, as seen in our OEM sales, and some with GeForce GTX boards. Our strategy is to stay alert to this fast-changing market, knowing that GPUs are highly efficient at running the algorithms used to mine cryptocurrencies. \\\\nMoving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue grew $235 million, up 10% from a year ago, up 15% sequentially and a demand for high-end, real-time rendering and for more powerful mobile workstations. Demand was especially strong in education, both among universities and large public school districts, as well as in the financial sector and defense industry. And last week, at SIGGRAPH\\'s computer graphics show, we highlighted how AI will augment the process of content creation. This new Optix 5 SDK uses AI to accelerate ray tracing. When running on our DGX rendering appliance, it provides the rendering capability of 150 standard dual-CPU servers. \\\\nWe also introduced NVIDIA eGPU system solutions. This creates a new category for our platforms using an external chassis to expand access to TITAN Xp and Quadro GPUs for the 25 million content creators using standard notebook PCs. \\\\nNext, Datacenter. Revenue of $416 million was up more than 2.5x from a year ago. This growth, shared across AI, deep learning, high-performance computing and GRID, is particularly notable given that we announced and shipped production units of our Volta-based V100 accelerator as we transition from Pascal-generation GPUs. \\\\nLooking ahead, we see inferencing and video transcoding as emerging applications that are well suited for our GPUs. V100 was among the most important launches at this quarter\\'s GPU Technology Conference. It provides 10x the deep learning power of its year-old predecessor, widely outpacing Moore\\'s Law. Some of the early V100 production units were given out in recent weeks to leading AI researchers attending the [CBPR] and ICML conferences. \\\\nWe made available our TensorRT 3 inference optimizer and run time for deep learning applications. It delivers 100x faster inferencing on V100 than the best CPU implementation. And it supports the industry\\'s 2 most common AI frameworks: Google TensorFlow and Facebook\\'s Caffe. \\\\nWe also entered into a wide range of important partnerships based on AI. Among them, Baidu has aligned with us on Volta. It\\'s bringing this new architecture to its cloud and optimizing the PaddlePaddle open-source deep learning framework for Volta. \\\\nVolkswagen is collaborating with us to bring the power of AI across their organization, and we announced a new partner program with Taiwan\\'s top ODMs including Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, Wistron to provide them with the early access to the HGX reference architecture, GPU computing technology and design guidelines. \\\\nDemand remains strong for our DGX AI supercomputer as organizations take on multiple systems to build out AI-enabled applications. Facebook disclosed a system incorporating 128 DGXs. We have shipped systems to more than 300 unique customers, with 1,000 plus in the pipeline. \\\\nOur HTC business remained strong. The new Green500 list showed that the world\\'s 13 most efficient supercomputers run on NVIDIA Tesla P100 accelerators. The top position is held by the Tokyo Institute of Technology\\'s TSUBAME 3.0 system. It achieved an extraordinary 14.1 gigaflops per watt, 50% higher efficiency than the previous leader, helping to point the way to [exascale] supercomputing. \\\\nMomentum continued in our GRID graphics virtualization business. Among key wins was Amazon Web Services whose G3 instances now run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs. \\\\nIn automotive. Revenue grew to $142 million, up 19% year-over-year. We announced important new partnerships based on our DRIVE PX AI platform, which is being used by more than 225 car and truck makers, Tier 1 suppliers, HD-mapping companies, start-ups and research institutions. Additionally, production cars using our technology continue to make their way into the market. \\\\nAudi announced last month that the 2019 A8 will be the first car to feature NVIDIA\\'s powered Level 3 autonomous technology. This means that, under certain specific use cases, it will be able to be driven by its own software without monitoring from the driver. \\\\nOur DRIVE PX platform is already on the road in Tesla Motors\\' full line of cars, including the new Model 3, which uses the second-generation Tesla autopilot. \\\\nThis quarter, we also announced that Toyota selected NVIDIA DRIVE PX for their next-generation autonomous cars. \\\\nVolvo, long a byword for safety and value, and Autoliv selected DRIVE PX for self-driving cars targeted to hit the market by 2021. ZF and Hella have selected the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform for their line of autonomous vehicle products. And Baidu announced that its Project Apollo open-source self-diving platform for the China market will use NVIDIA DRIVE PX. \\\\nYou\\'ll be hearing more from us in the months ahead at regional GTCs that we will be conducting in Beijing, Munich, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Washington, D.C. and Tokyo. \\\\nNow turning to the rest of the Q2 income statement. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter were 58.4% and 58.6%, respectively, reflecting the decline in in-sell licensing revenue. \\\\nQ2 GAAP operating expenses were $614 million; non-GAAP operating expenses were $533 million, up 19% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiatives. GAAP operating income was $688 million; non-GAAP operating income was $773 million, doubling from a year-ago. GAAP net income was $583 million; non-GAAP net income, $638 million, also doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion. \\\\nFor fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In the first half of fiscal 2018, we have paid $758 million in share repurchases and $166 million in quarterly cash dividends. \\\\nNow turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 58.8%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. \\\\nGAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $672 million, non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $570 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $2 million, inclusive of additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are supposed -- are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. \\\\nFurther financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website. We will now open the call for questions. (Operator Instructions) \\\\nOperator, will you please poll for the first question? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nVivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Maybe a clarification or a question, and a question after that on the data center. On the clarification side, we have seen several quarters where your Datacenter business grew very strongly on a sequential basis. This time, the growth was somewhat more modest, and I was wondering if there is a little more color around that. And then the bigger question is, Jensen, it seems the data center market is sort of bifurcating between your GPU approach on one side and ASICs on the other side. What are you doing to make sure that the balance sort of stays in your favor as the market matures from here?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, so first of all, Q2 was a transition quarter for our data center, right? I thought we did great. I thought we did great. We almost tripled year-over-year. And we ramped Volta into volume production. And because Volta was so much better than our last-generation processor, Volta is 100x faster than Kepler. 100x faster than Kepler just 4 years ago, and Kepler was already 10x faster than CPUs. And so Volta was such a giant leap when we announced it in GTC right at the beginning of the quarter. I thought the team did fantastically, transitioning the customer base to Volta, and now Volta is in high-volume production. The application of data center -- you asked a larger question about data center. The data center, data center is a very large market, as you know, and the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world\\'s future computing will be largely done in data centers. And there\\'s a very well-accepted notion now that GPU acceleration for servers delivers extraordinary value proposition. If you have a data-intensive application and the vast majority of the future applications in data centers will be data-intensive, a GPU could reduce the number of servers you require or increase the number of the amount of throughput pretty substantially. Just adding one GPU to a server could reduce several hundred thousand dollars of reduction in the number of servers. And so the value proposition in the cost savings of using GPUs is quite extraordinary. There are several applications in data centers. First of all, there\\'s training and there\\'s high-performance computing; there\\'s cloud virtual PC, as what Amazon AWS G3 announcement was about this last -- this quarter; and then there\\'s also new applications such as inferencing as these models are now going into production and the new applications that are coming online, which is likely to overwhelm the Internet in the near future, which is live video. Consumers taking live video on their phones and sharing with their friends and there\\'s -- there are going to be hundreds of millions of these happening all the time. And each one of these videos will have to be transcoded to a variety of formats to be shared with their friends and also has to be -- you have to perform AI on it instantaneously so that you could avoid inappropriate video from being streamed to large audiences. And so the number of applications where GPUs are valuable, from training to high-performance computing to virtual PCs to new applications like inferencing and transcoding and AI, are starting to emerge. The one area where you\\'re talking about ASICs and TPUs, TPU is basically an ASIC. The way to think about that is this is after 4 generations of evolution of our GPU, NVIDIA GPU is basically a TPU that does a lot more. We could perform deep learning applications, whether it\\'s in training or in inferencing now, starting with the Pascal P4 and the Volta generation. We can inference better than any known ASIC on the market that I\\'ve ever seen. And so the new generation of our GPU is essentially a TPU that does a lot more, and we can do all the things that I just mentioned and the vast number of applications that are emerging in the cloud. And so our belief is this. Our belief is that, number one, a GPU has to be versatile to handle the vast array of big data and data-intensive applications that are happening in the cloud, because the cloud is a computer, it\\'s not an appliance. It\\'s not a toaster, it\\'s not a lightbulb, it\\'s not a microphone. The cloud has a large number of applications that are data-intensive. And second, we have to be world-class at deep learning. And so our GPUs have to evolve into something that can be absolutely world-class TPU, but it has to do all of the things that a data center needs to do.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          It sounds like things went very well on the cryptocurrency side. And that market has not had a lot of history, but a little history it has had, had some volatility. And I was wondering if you could help us understand how you think about managing that volatility. And a broader question on this topic is, do you consider cryptocurrency or other blockchain applications on par with your other 4 big markets?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, thanks. Cryptocurrency and blockchain is here to stay. The market need for it is going to grow, and over time, it will become quite large. I -- it is very clear that new currencies will come to market. And it\\'s very clear that the GPU is just fantastic at cryptography, and as these new algorithms are being developed, the GPU is really quite ideal for it. And so this is a market that is not likely to go away anytime soon, and the only thing that we can probably expect is that there will be more currencies to come. It will come in a whole lot of different nations. It will be -- it will emerge from time to time, and the GPU\\'s really quite great for it. What we\\'ve done, our strategy is to stay very, very close to the market. We understand its dynamics really well. And we offer the coin miners a special coin-mining SKU, and this product is -- this product -- this GPU configuration is optimized for mining. We stay very close to the market. We know its every single move and we know its dynamics. And then the last thing that I can say is that, the larger of a GPU company you are, the greater ability you could absorb the volatility. And so between the combination of the fact that we have GPUs at just about every single price point, we have such incredibly efficient designs, that we\\'re so close to the marketplace and because we have such large volumes, we have the ability to rock and roll with this market as it goes. Okay? But this is an important market that likely will continue to grow over time.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nToshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD     [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, great. I have a question on some of the numbers. So Q2 revenue came in roughly about $250 million above your guide. Can you kind of confirm what some of the drivers were to the upside relative to your guidance? Was it all cryptocurrency or was it a combination of multiple things? And related to that, for your Q3 guide, I think you are guiding revenue up about $120 million sequentially. What are the puts and takes here on a sequential basis? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Let\\'s see. First of all, we actually gave a really great guidance last quarter, and we beat it by $250 million. And the $250 million, you could see in our -- what we categorized under the OEM SKUs, basically the cryptocurrency SKUs. And that, if you reverse-engineered it out, I think, is approximately $150 million. And I -- and we serve the vast -- I would say, the large majority of the cryptocurrency demand out of that specialized products. There\\'re still small miners that buy GeForces here and there, and that probably also increased the demand of GeForces. There were a lot of shortages all over the world, and as we go into this quarter, it\\'s -- there\\'s still cryptocurrency mining demand that we know is out there. And based on our analytics and understanding of the marketplace, there will be some amount of demand for the foreseeable future. But I -- it\\'s also the case that there were gamers who -- whose needs and demands were not filled last quarter. And the second quarter, the second quarter is an important part of the year for us. I mean, we -- GeForce is in an incredibly great strategic position. After all of the numerous product launches that we\\'ve seen from other players, it\\'s very, very clear that the GeForce product lineup is absolutely the best in the world. And the second half is going to see some very exciting titles. You\\'ve got Destiny 2, you have Call of Duty from Activision, you have Star Wars Battlefront from EA. I mean, these are going to be blockbusters, and we\\'re expecting them to do incredibly well. We also know that a game that came out of nowhere -- and this is one of the things that\\'s really great about the video game market, you never know where the next amazing new title\\'s going to come from. PlayersUnknown Battleground (sic) [PlayerUnknown\\'s Battlegrounds], it\\'s really essentially survival -- Survivor meets Hunger Games. How could that not be a fun game? And so they\\'ve done incredibly well. And so I think the market dynamic is really, really vibrant for the second half of the year, and we have a really great position. With respect to our guidance. The way to think about our guidance, we gave a good guidance and we\\'re comfortable with our guidance. And we know that the dynamics in our business, our data center position, is quite exciting. We know that our Gaming business is vibrant and our position is excellent. We\\'ve -- we saw growth across all of our product segments. And we\\'ll just see how it turns out at the end of the next quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          First, I was wondering if you could tell us how much Volta contributed to the data center revenue in the quarter. And what are your expectations for that ramp trajectory into the second half? And the reason I ask is, when I look at gross margins, they\\'re fine but it doesn\\'t look like the Volta ramp is driving upside to that number. So I\\'m trying to get some feeling for the trajectory of that ramp.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, first of all, it\\'s very difficult to reverse-engineer from the first ramp of Volta any impact on gross margins. And the reason for that is because the first ramps tend to be more costly, and you\\'re still trying to stabilize yield, there\\'s a lot of complexities involved. But what I can tell you is that we shipped a lot of Voltas. We shipped a lot of Voltas. And Volta is fully ramped. Customers are clamoring for it. The leap generationally for deep learning is quite extraordinary. And so we\\'re expecting Volta to be very, very successful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Senior Equity Research Analyst and Fundamental Research Analyst    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I guess, a follow-up question to that on the Volta transition and now that, that is ramping in high-volume manufacturing and considering the pretty large uplift in die size there. Curious how you\\'re thinking about ASP uplift over time, and whether you would expect that to drive a reacceleration in growth in data center looking into the second half of the calendar year.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. So the first way to think about our ASP is to think about the value proposition that our GPUs provide. Whenever you include a Volta in your data center, in your server that is doing data-intensive processing, the number of commodity servers that it replaces and the number of just NICs and cables that it replaces is pretty extraordinary. Every single Volta allows you to save several hundred thousand dollars. And so the price of Volta is driven by the fact that, of course, the manufacturing process is quite extraordinary. I mean, these are expensive things to go and design. The manufacturing cost itself, you guys can estimate, is probably in the several hundred dollars, close to $1,000. However, the software intensity of developing Volta, the architectural intensity of developing Volta, the -- all of the software intensity associated with all the algorithms and optimizing all the algorithms of Volta is really where the value added ultimately ends up. And so I guess, the pricing -- your question really is pricing, we\\'re going to -- we expect pricing to be quite favorable for Volta. And then your second question, I think, is related to acceleration. The growth -- the data center growth opportunity for us is quite significant, as you know. I mean, there are several applications that demand GPUs today. Almost every single data center in the world today recognizes that GPU is the path forward for data-intensive processing. Every single OEM and every single cloud service provider now supports NVIDIA GPUs and offer NVIDIA GPUs, and Volta is going to be the engine that serves them. And so I\\'m expecting a lot of good things from Volta.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAtif Malik,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Semiconductor Capital Equipment and Specialty Semiconductor Analyst    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the strong results. Even if you exclude the [QEM] contribution, you would have beaten The Street expectations. My question is in auto. You\\'ve announced a very strong pipeline of auto partnerships this year. Can you just talk about when do you expect acceleration in auto sales? And are there any other ways you can monetize your auto partnerships maybe through licensing of software stacks?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thanks a lot, Atif. The road map for auto kind of looks like this. For this year and next, what you should see is development partnerships that we have with a growing number of car companies, and they\\'re reflected in our e-projects, development systems and purchasing of our AI supercomputers like DGX. And so for the next, I would say, this year and the vast majority of next year, that\\'s what you should expect from the autonomous driving perspective. Starting next year, you\\'re going to start to see robot taxis start to come to the road. We\\'re working with a handful, maybe, I guess, about 6 or 7 really exciting robot taxi projects around the world. And you could see them start to go into prototype or beta testing starting now. And then, next year, you\\'ll see a lot more of them. And starting 2019, you\\'ll see them going to real commercial services. And so those are robot taxis, what some in the industry call Level 5s, basically driverless cars. And then the fully autonomous driver cars -- driven cars, branded cars, will start hitting the road around 2020 and 2021, okay? And so the way to think about it is this year and next is really about development. Starting next year and the following year is robot taxis. And then 2021 to -- forward, you\\'re going to see a lot of Level 4s.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. I wanted to actually ask about the pro vis business. That business continues to grow faster than I had expected, and you had a really good for quarter there. Can you talk about what\\'s driving that and what the trajectory of that business looks like?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Our Pro business, call it, roughly nearly $1 billion, it was -- it grew, what, 8% last year. It grew 8% the year before that, maybe a little bit less. And this year, it grow -- it grew about 10%, maybe a little faster. The way to think about that business is it\\'s really a platform for design, and the digital design of all kinds. And it\\'s designing movies, designing cars, designing products, people designing websites. Anybody who\\'s doing digital design could really benefit from our Quadro platform. It\\'s very software-intensive, it\\'s certified with every major computer-aided design package. It\\'s certified by large industrial companies all over the world. You could use Quadro and bring up a database 10 years from now and know that, because of the nature of how we manage our software, the certification process we go through with each one of the major industry partners, we could pull up an entire design that\\'s designed 5 years ago 10 years from now. And so if anything were to happen to a product or a plane or a ship or a building, the level of certainty in your data integrity is going to be complete. And so the software intensity is high, and the -- and our platform is recognized all over the world as the industry standard. The growth opportunity for Quadro are several, and it\\'s starting to kick in. And I have -- I\\'m rather optimistic about its future growth as well. One of them is photorealistic rendering. We now have the ability to use our artificial intelligence and ray tracing technology in combination, called Optix 5.0 that we just announced at SIGGRAPH, that allows you to visualize photorealistic rendering practically interactively. And it\\'s just an amazing thing to watch. Second, we now have a new system, called the external GPU system, that\\'s a partnership between the work that we did with Intel. And all of our partners in the ecosystem taking advantage of Thunderbolt 3 and the new external GPU-capable Windows system, you can now have an external system connect to Thunderbolt. And basically, our GPU is outside the laptop. And so for some 25 million, 20 million users of thin and light notebooks, you can now have the ability to have the GPU as well and get a boost in your productivity like you\\'ve never seen before. And so you can now have thin notebooks and still have the benefit of our GPUs. And so that\\'s a new market for us. We\\'re going to see virtual reality do quite well, and especially in design. And we\\'ve partnered with HP recently to do an industrial version of a backpack that allows designers to be able to freely roam within their design space and completely in virtual reality. And so there\\'s a variety of growth drivers in that business that I\\'m quite excited about.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCraig Andrew Ellis,  B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior MD & Director of Research    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Congratulations on the very good execution and capitalizing on the crypto opportunity. Jensen, I wanted to start, just connecting a few dots, you had mentioned that there was significant upside from that opportunity, and we\\'ve seen through checks that we can do via public means that demand was very strong in the quarter. And as I look ahead at the guidance for the fiscal third quarter\\'s up 5%, when I think, normally, it would be up in the low double digits. So can you talk about how comfortable you are with your supply availability here? And if demand was there for double-digit growth, if you\\'d be able to achieve that? And then, Colette, one for you. The OpEx guidance setup, I think it\\'s $37 million quarter-on-quarter, more than we\\'ve seen the last few quarters. Can you just bin out what some of the bigger drivers for that increase are?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Thanks a lot. So first of all, there\\'s -- to answer that question, I would say there are 3 factors. The first factor is our strategic position. Our competitive lineup is probably the best it\\'s ever been, and better than last year, even, which was incredibly strong, better than a year before that because it was incredibly strong. I think our strategic position and the value of our architecture is more powerful today than ever. And so our -- I think #1 is our strategic position. The second, if the demand were there in the second half with respect to -- from a perspective of Gaming demand, and if there\\'s any residual with crypto demand, we will surely be able to serve it. And then, lastly, the factor is related to our guidance. Our guidance is -- we\\'re comfortable with our guidance. We\\'re happy with our guidance, and we want to have an opportunity to come back and give you an update in Q3.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          And Craig, on your second question regarding the OpEx guidance in Q3. Generally, our guidance and actuals as we move into Q3 is usually a little stronger, and it\\'s consistent with our normal annual compensation increase that happens in Q3. And also keep in mind, we are expected to move into our new headquarter building within Q3. And underlying our overall growth and investments is our hiring and focus in terms of on AI, autonomous driving as well as Gaming. So all of these factors contribute to that with about a 19% year-over-year growth rate in terms of what we\\'re targeting.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, I just wanted to clarify some earlier comments with regard to Volta and data center. Is it correct to interpret your comments to mean that some customers may have tended to delay purchases as you went through the quarter as they\\'re waiting for Volta, given the stronger performance gains for that? And if that\\'s the case, if I\\'ve got that right, now that Volta is fully ramped, do you expect that to drive stronger growth rates as you go through the second half?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          The first -- the answer to your first question is yes. Volta is -- it was a giant leap. It\\'s kind of 120 teraflops. 120 teraflops. Another way to think about that is 8 of them in 1 node is essentially 1 petaflops, which puts it in the -- among the top 20 fastest supercomputer on the planet. And I -- the entire world\\'s top 500 supercomputers is only 700 petaflops. And with 8 Voltas in 1 box for doing artificial intelligence, it represents one of them. And so that\\'s -- Volta is just a gigantic lead for deep learning, and it\\'s such a gigantic leap for processing that -- and we announced that at GTC, if you recall, which is practically right at the beginning of the quarter. And so the transition was not insignificant, and it was that the team just executed flawlessly. I\\'m so proud of the team that they executed the most complex processor that\\'s ever been built. And working with our teams, working with our partners at TSMC and Samsung and all of our package partners, Bill, and they just did a great job for us. And so the team did great. Now looking forward, there\\'s a whole bunch of growth drivers for our data center business. Deep learning is -- training is a growth driver. Cloud computing, high-performance computing is a growth driver, and we have new growth drivers with inferencing. And so I\\'m pretty excited about our prospects going into the age of -- the generation of Volta. In terms of the guidance and what we expect, I think our dynamics are really positive. And so we just got to -- we\\'re happy with the guidance, and let\\'s give you an update at the end of the quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWilliam Shalom Stein,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Great. Jensen, you\\'ve had a couple questions already about sort of the pace of growth in data center in the second half from Volta, but I\\'m thinking a little bit further out. At GTC, you highlighted this $30 billion TAM opportunity by 2020. And when we look at the charts that you\\'ve published about your expectation for exaflops -- the number of exaflops required to train an increasing number of deep learning networks through 2020, it looks like your expectation is for that to accelerate over time. But naturally, the Street\\'s contemplating a decelerating growth for data center. People don\\'t expect things to grow 150-plus percent forever. So can you comment as to the growth trajectory beyond maybe the very near term in that business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes. I think, at the highest level, the way to think about that is data-intensive computing. Data-intensive computing, whether it\\'s deep learning or high-performance computing, the GPU is just phenomenal at it. NVIDIA\\'s CUDA GPU was after 12 years of driving this architecture and pioneering this computing approach, it\\'s just a home run. And the value proposition and the money that it saves people, the amount of energy that it saves, is quite extraordinary. One way to think about that is if you speed up an application by a factor of 10, you\\'re basically saying that it takes 10x fewer servers to do the same job or you could do 10x as much work in the same amount of servers. And so the value proposition is really quite great. And the applications that we serve is really diverse now. It used to be just high-performance computing and supercomputing, but the number of applications we serve span Internet service providers, manufacturing, health care, financial services, transportation. The number of data-intensive applications and industries that need them is really growing very fast. And so how fast does that -- what does that imply in terms of long-term growth? It\\'s kind of hard to say. It\\'s kind of hard to say. But first principles would suggest, first principles would suggest that every single data center in the world will be GPU-accelerated someday, and I\\'ve always believed that. And I believe that even more today because I believe that, in the future, this new computing model that we all finally call AI is going to be a highly data-intensive business model, and the GPU is the ideal computing model for that. And so I\\'m not exactly sure if that completely answers your question, and partly because I\\'m not exactly sure. I just know that the -- on first principles, the computing architecture is ideal. There\\'s every evidence that every single data center and every single OEM and every single Internet service provider is jumping on this architecture and jumping on Volta. And I believe that AI is going to be the future of computing. And so somewhere between those beliefs and executing the business is the truth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nHans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Jensen, can you give us an update in terms of how the new platforms and servers may have impacted the business in the data center, with Purley launching here recently and the upcoming Epyc? And as a follow-on, when can we expect Volta in the consumer gaming markets?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, that\\'s a good question, Hans, and it\\'s a good observation. Because Purley, I didn\\'t know if everybody understood that codename, but Purley is a new motherboard, new platform for Intel servers and the CPU, Skylake. And it\\'s an excellent server platform. And obviously, every OEM and every service provider was waiting for the launch of that, and it officially launched in the middle of this quarter. And so did it affect the rollout of new servers based on GPUs? Probably, it did, and surely, it did. But now that it\\'s ramped, it\\'s a successful ramp. Every single cloud provider and every single OEM is now fully geared up to take that server to market, and they all have GPU options. Every single OEM in the world now and every cloud provider in every ODM now has NVIDIA GPU chassis and platforms, whether it\\'s in one GPU in one [U] to 8 GPUs in a supercomputing configuration. And so the number of options of ways to enjoy NVIDIA GPUs is really quite countless now. Volta for Gaming, we haven\\'t announced anything. And all I can say is that our pipeline is filled with some exciting new toys for the gamers. And we have some really exciting new technology to offer them in the pipeline. But for the holiday season, for the foreseeable future, I think Pascal is just unbeatable. It\\'s just the best thing out there. And everybody who\\'s looking forward to playing Call of Duty or Destiny 2, if they don\\'t already have one, should run out and get themselves a Pascal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I just had 2 kind of high-level ones. So first, it\\'s your comments on cryptocurrency and blockchain. So when decentralized applications begin to take off and we see people essentially renting out parallel processing, how are you guys going to essentially be able to tell what products are being used in kind of a [lease] model versus what\\'s being used in Gaming, et cetera?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, first of all, it\\'s not really possible because our GPUs are all architecturally compatible, which, at some level, is one of our strengths. There are hundreds of millions of NVIDIA GPUs in the world, and they\\'re all CUDA-compatible and they\\'re all 100% CUDA-compatible. And we\\'re so rigorous and so disciplined about ensuring their compatibility that, for developers, it\\'s really a wonderful platform. However, we are thoughtful about how we configure the GPUs so that they\\'re best for the applications. Some applications would like to have the maximum amount of performance in a few nodes. Some would like to have the maximum amount of performance within 30 watts. Some would like to have the maximum amount of flexibility with all of the I/O pin connectors and all display connectors. Some people like to have multi-GPUs and that they have the ability to configure them together. And so every market has a slightly different need. And we have to understand the market needs and understand what it is that the customers are looking for and configure something that is best for them.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Got it. And then just one small one and a follow-up, do you guys have an estimate on how fast the neural network is growing right now relative to a year ago?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Let\\'s see. A neural net, in terms of complexity, is approximately -- not quite, but approximately doubling every year, and this is one of the exciting things about artificial intelligence. In no time in our -- in my history of looking at computers in the last 35 years have we ever seen a double exponential, where the GPU computing model, our GPUs, are essentially increasing in performance by approximately 3x each year in order to be 100x in just 4 years. We have to increase in performance, overall system performance, by a factor of 3 -- by over a factor of 3 every year. And yet on the other hand, on top of it, the neural network architecture and the algorithms that are being developed are improving in accuracy by about twice each year. And so object recognition and accuracy is improving by twice each year, or the error rate is decreasing by half each year. And speech recognition is improving by a factor of 2 each year. And so you\\'ve got these 2 exponentials that are happening, and it\\'s pretty exciting. And it\\'s one of the reasons why AI is moving so fast.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nBlayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          On the data center, it was slightly below The Street number. I know it\\'s not your number, but I think we\\'ve gotten used to you surpassing The Street number by a wide margin. Wondering if you could just talk about the July quarter, the 3 subsegments, and if they came in as expected. And as you look to October, if you could talk about what kind of growth or -- you\\'re looking for, for that segment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          I\\'m not sure I understand the question. Colette, if you understand it, go ahead and answer it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nColette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          So in discussing how we did versus our guidance, again, we overshot our overall guidance for Q2. Part of that was the cryptocurrency. And your question was more around the Datacenter and the Datacenter number. We set out with a good amount of work ahead of us to transition to Volta within the quarter. We\\'re very pleased with that result and the overall year-over-year growth that we accomplished in terms of the Datacenter. We always have different ranges across the organization and across the different businesses. But we don\\'t have specifics in terms of our guidance nor did we provide specific guidance in terms of on the Datacenter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRobert Bruce Mertens,  Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Research Assoc of Microcontrollers, Analog & Mixed Signal; Consumer IC & Multi-Market & Computing    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Robert Mertens on behalf of Raji. I guess I wanted to get a little more clarity towards your automotive division. I didn\\'t know if you broke out rough percentages about the near-term growth between infotainment and these ADAS or autonomous vehicle systems. And then as a follow-up in the autonomous systems, how you\\'re sort of pricing between the different levels, if that\\'s mainly just the GPUs or if the software is baked in there as well.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Well, our GPUs are useless without software, [surfing the backboard forward]. Our GPUs are useless because -- without software. And the reason for that is because, otherwise, they -- each one of the markets, whether it\\'s playing games or professional visualization or high-performance computing, doing molecular dynamics, computation or doing seismic processing or perceiving the 3-dimensional world around the car and reasoning about where it is and trying to figure out how to drive, all of that software is very, very different. What we do is we -- there\\'s a core in our company, the core architecture is a GPU core. However, the configuration of the products and the chips and the systems are very different from market to market. And so somebody asked me earlier, the gentleman asked me about cryptocurrency. That configuration is very, very different than a Gaming configuration, which is different than a high-performance computing configuration. And it\\'s different from our inferencing configuration, and it\\'s different from our self-driving-car configuration. And so the chips are designed to be different even though they\\'re architecturally identical. And then the systems are designed to be market-specific and application-specific. And the software on top of it is super, super application-specific. And that\\'s one of the reasons why our company is increasingly differentiated from a components company and what we call a platform company. Each one of these platforms that we bring to market are very, very different even though, at its core, this data-intensive parallel computing architecture called CUDA is essential among all of them. We don\\'t break out the automotive from the rest of the Tegra business. The Tegra business consists of basically 3 parts at the moment. One part is -- one major component of it is the Nintendo Switch gaming console, and they\\'re just doing incredibly well. I\\'m so happy for Nintendo because they\\'re risk-takers, they\\'re innovators, they -- they\\'re -- they don\\'t -- they\\'re not influenced by what other people do, and they\\'re original thinkers and I just love the way they invented the Switch and the way they\\'ve taken it to market. I\\'m so happy for them. And it\\'s doing really well. The second major component is our self-driving car platforms and a lot of it still is the infotainment systems. Our infotainment system is going to evolve into an AI cockpit product line. We\\'re going to -- we initially started with autonomous driving, but you\\'ve probably heard me say at GTC that our future infotainment systems will basically turn your cockpit or turn your car into an AI. So your whole car will become an AI. It\\'ll talk to you, it\\'ll know where you are, and knows who\\'s in the cabin. And if there\\'s potential things to be concerned about around the car, it might even just tell you in natural language. And so the entire AI will be -- the entire car will become an AI. We announced at CES a partnership with Daimler, and they talked about the work that we\\'re doing together in the next-generation car, how we\\'re going to bring the AI into the car. And that\\'s our first visible -- highly visible project, and there are others that we\\'re working on. And then the future projects, starting from end of next year with robot taxis, and starting with 2020, the autonomous cars, fully autonomous cars. You\\'re going to see the rest of that come online. And that\\'s a major component of Tegra. And then the last component, the third component, the major component, I would say, is AI at the edge. That\\'s the next major revolution. And I -- we have a new product line. It\\'s -- that we announced about a year ago, and it\\'s called Jetson. Jetson is just -- it\\'s just an amazing little AI computer. And if you want to do deep learning at the edge, whether it\\'s really, really clever cameras for smart and safe cities, to traffic lights that can now monitor traffic, Jetson and AI at the edge is going to be the next growth opportunity for us. And those 3 major segments make up essentially the Tegra business. We haven\\'t split each one of them out separately. But one of these days, we\\'ll consider doing it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Your final question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nTing Pong Ho,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Associate    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. I think, last year this time, I think you -- on the Datacenter business, you disclosed -- I think, highlighted the growth for your cloud business, your deep learning business was about half, and then for HPC. I was wondering, as you\\'re ramping Volta, how would you -- how should we think about maybe the mix as you\\'re entering the second half of the year between HPC, cloud and maybe the rest of the business for the Datacenter?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJensen Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          Yes, Ambrish (sic) [Gabriel], that\\'s a good question. Partly, I\\'m not in total control of the answer. But on first principles, let me maybe explain it this way. I believe that there are a few hundred million office workers and information workers whose PCs will be virtualized and just become an application, like Netflix, and it will be virtualized, it\\'ll be streamed from our cloud GPUs called GRID. I believe that every single company in the world, manufacturing, health care, finance, will use computational approaches to analyzing their business. And some of them will use it -- will use AI and some of them will use traditional first-principle, physics-based algorithms. And I -- and it\\'s hard to say exactly what the split\\'s going to be. I -- my guess, however, is that AI will be the larger part of that. But you\\'re going to see hybrid versions of it. Most computations, the reason why we\\'re so bullish about CUDA and our GPU, which is able to do both general purpose computation as well as deep learning, is because most algorithms has the combination of both. Inside the car, we don\\'t just use deep learning, we use CUDA and deep learning. We use CUDA for all kinds of algorithms, computer vision algorithms, including deep learning. And so -- and we\\'re seeing in quantum chemistry, in physics simulations like fluid dynamics, more and more of the algorithms are hybrids of deep learning and numerics. And so I -- that segment of the marketplace is kind of hard to predict. And then there\\'s the -- there\\'s just the consumer Internet service providers and the billions and billions of queries that are going into the cloud. Some of them are text, some of them are speech, and increasingly, some of them are video. But the amount of traffic that\\'s going to be inferenced using deep learning is going to be quite explosive. It\\'s kind of hard to know exactly the pace of each one of these. But I think, on first principles, we would all agree that these are large computation challenges and that the previous model of using just microprocessors to do that computation is not efficient. And that the GPU, with its parallel data processing capability and now our fourth-generation deep learning architecture, you essentially have a TPU that does a whole bunch more. And so I think the approach that we take has great promise, and we\\'re just super enthusiastic about it. But exactly how much it\\'s going to contribute in the near term in percentages is going to be hard to guess. \\\\nOkay, that was great. I appreciate all the questions. We had a great quarter. We\\'re seeing exciting growth dynamics driving in each of our businesses. This is the era of artificial intelligence, and NVIDIA has dedicated ourselves to be its brain. Cloud and Internet service providers are going in -- going all in on AI and jumping on to our new Volta GPU. Enterprises and giant industries from transportation to health care to manufacturing to financial services have awakened to the power of AI, and the growing pipeline of the NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer is a great indicator. The next revolution of AI will be AI at the edge, and the most visible and impactful evidence will be the autonomous vehicle. Our strategy is to build a ground-up, deep learning platform for self-driving cars, and that has put us in pole position to lead the charge. And in Gaming, which is actually the first consumer AI application, we have a great strategic position in this growing market. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ahead. We can make an amazing impact on the future of the world. \\\\nThanks for joining us today, and we look forward to giving you another update next quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n          This concludes today\\'s conference call.

Raja Koduri, Senior Vice President and Chief Architect, Radeon Technologies Group, will attend the Jefferies Semiconductor Hardware and Communications Infrastructure Summit in Chicago on August 30.\\\\nMark Papermaster, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, will present at the Deutsche Bank's Technology Conference on September 13 in Las Vegas. And our third-quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, September 16, 2016. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that second quarter -- that the second-quarter 2016 was a 13-week quarter, and we expect to record our extra week in the fourth quarter of 2016.\\\\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.\\\\nAdditionally, please note we will be referring to non-GAAP figures during this call except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary that we've posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.AMD.com.\\\\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 2016.\\\\nNow with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Ruth.\"), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"And good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our ongoing focus on diversifying our business model and delivering great products is creating solid market and financial momentum. Looking at the second-quarter specifically, strong semicustom demand and better-than-seasonal graphic sales drove a 23% sequential revenue increase and our return to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWe also recorded our first full quarter licensing gain from our China server JV, THATIC, and improved our balance sheet with cash proceeds from the formation of our ATMP joint venture, with NFME. Looking at our Computing and Graphic segment, revenue decreased 5% sequentially, as stronger-than-seasonal GPU sales were offset by a decline in desktop processor sales.\\\\nFirst-half 2016 GPU sales increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, as the investments we have been making to develop leadership graphics hardware, software and drivers, combined with new marketing campaigns, are paying off.\\\\nOur strong second-quarter graphics performance was capped by the launch of our new Polaris based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June, which helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014. The Radeon RX family resets expectations around the experiences and features gamers now want in a mainstream GPU.\\\\nWe are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desk top GPUs, and Polaris based notebooks from our OEM customers. We also delivered our third straight quarter of sequential professionals graphics revenue growth and believe we gained share driven by increased adoption of FirePro graphics by OEMs as well as several cloud data center GPU compute wins.\\\\nIn client, mobile APUs sales increased for the third straight quarter, partially offsetting decreased desktop processor sales led by channel softness in China. Shipments of our recently launched seventh generation APUs are ramping well and outpacing sales of our six-generation APUs at this point in their lifecycle.\\\\nMore than 25 new seventh generation APU systems, including several premium designs, are expected to be widely available in the coming months from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, providing us with confidence in this part of our business as we enter the seasonally stronger second half of the year.\\\\nTurning to our enterprise embedded and semicustom segment, our 59% sequential revenue increase is the largest since our first full quarter of semicustom products shipments in 2013. As in the previous two years, we expect semicustom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semicustom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.\\\\nLast quarter at E3, Microsoft announced two new members of the Xbox One family powered by AMD. The Xbox One S is the slimmest Xbox console ever, and the first to support HDR. The system is expected to go on sale in the coming weeks. Microsoft also announced their next-generation game console, code-named Project Scorpio, for the 2017 holidays.\\\\nProject Scorpios is designed to be fully compatible with existing Xbox One software, while leveraging AMD's leadership gaming technologies to create more immersive 4K and VR gaming experiences. Project Scorpio is one of the semicustom design wins we communicated previously.\\\\nOur next generation Zen processor products passed several key milestones in the quarter as well. I'm excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers' labs.\\\\nWe are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.\\\\nIn closing, over the last 18 months, we have been diligently executing our strategic plan to improve our financial performance by delivering great products, strengthening our customer relationships, and simplifying our business. In the past six months alone, we released our game-changing Polaris architecture, completed our ATMP JV transaction, announced a JV and IP licensing transaction with THATIC, and returned to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWhile we recognize we have more work to do, we believe that, based on the ongoing ramps of our semicustom SoCs, Polaris GPUs, and seventh generation APUs, we can deliver full-year revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on delivering our road map of high performance products and technologies, including Zen and our next generation Vega GPU architecture that can drive long-term growth.\\\\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second-quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was a strong quarter, punctuated by better-than-expected financial performance, driven by demand for our semicustom SoCs and the closure of our ATMP joint venture transaction with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, which bolstered our cash position.\\\\nSecond-quarter revenue was $1.027 billion, up 23% sequentially, driven by higher sales of semicustom SoCs. The year-over-year revenue increase was 9% with higher sales in both reportable segments. Gross margin was 31%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of semicustom SoCs sales.\\\\nOperating expenses were $342 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased marketing investments. We also recognized a $26 million licensing gain associated with our JV with THATIC, and restructuring credits of $7 million, primarily related to facilities. We are pleased to report operating income of $3 million this quarter.\\\\nNet loss was $40 million with loss per share of $0.05, calculated using 794 million basic shares in the quarter. We recorded a pretax gain of $150 million related to the ATMP JV transaction, an equity loss of $3 million based on our 15% ownership stake, and taxes of $27 million related to the JV transaction. Adjusted EBITDA was a positive $36 million compared to negative $22 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments -- Computing and Graphics revenue was $435 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of client desktop processors and chipsets. Revenue was up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by higher client notebook Processor and Graphics sales.\\\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating loss was $81 million compared to $70 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower revenue. Enterprise, embedded and semicustom revenue was $592 million, up 59% from the prior quarter and 5% higher than the prior year, driven by higher semicustom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from [$16 million] in the prior quarter, driven by higher revenue and a $26 million IP licensing gain compared to a licensing gain of $7 million in the first quarter.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter. Inventory was $743 million, up $68 million or 10% from the prior quarter, and higher than guided, in support of expected higher semicustom sales in the third quarter.\\\\nIn the second quarter, we recorded a $62 million investment on our balance sheet related to our 15% ownership stake in the ATMP JV. Total wafer purchases from GlobalFoundries in the second quarter were 75 million and year-to-date, we have purchased 259 million.\\\\nDebt as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, and includes total borrowings of $226 million on our secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow in the second quarter was negative $106 million compared to a negative $68 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the inventory build in support of strong second-half revenue.\\\\nNow turning to the outlook, which is based on a 13-week fiscal quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by our graphics and semicustom products, including the ramp of new semicustom business; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million, due to an increase in R&D investments; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $22 million to maintain non-GAAP operating profitability; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes or other -- and other to be approximately $45 million; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately flat; and inventory to be approximately $700 million. And lastly, for the full-year 2016, we expect low-single digit revenue growth year-over-year.\\\\nIn closing, we are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. We launched exciting new products in the second quarter, with more expected to come to help drive strong revenue growth and improved financial performance in the third quarter. We recognize there's a lot more work to be done to return AMD to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation, and look forward to continuing our progress over the coming quarters.\\\\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Ruth.

So, our semicustom business overall, we see as strong for the year. I think the predominant business is the current generation game consoles, and as they ramp into the second half and the stronger holiday season.\\\\nWe expect the seasonality of semicustoms to be similar to prior years. We'll see a peak in the third quarter and a decline in the fourth quarter, and we will see the new business layer in starting in the third quarter. But I don't expect that to change the seasonality pattern. So, we are building up for a strong holiday season overall.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay.

And since the launch of your Radeon 480 graphics product end of last month, have you been able to supply to demand for the cards? Or if not, when do you expect demand will rise to match supply?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So, David, we're very pleased with the launch of the Radeon RX 480. We had good supply at major retailers on launch day. Since then, the demand has continued to be strong and so some of the retailers are out of supply. We do see that the 14 LPP yields are good and we're ramping up production steeply.\\\\nSo we expect that will equalize as we go through the quarter. We're also very soon going to launch the rest of the Radeon RX family. And so you'll see three products in the third quarter in terms of overall product momentum.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat.

First one -- Lisa, maybe for you -- the China licensing deal was -- I thought it was creative and fascinating. Can you characterize kind of the pipeline of IP deals that you have or the technology deals? Is this it? Or do you have more in the pipe? Can you talk about timing or the types of deals you might be working on?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Mark. So the China JV, as you said, we announced it last quarter and it's now in operation. It's actually going well, so we're on track for some of the important milestone deliveries that we had.\\\\nIn terms of the overall pipeline, I would say we have a nice set of interesting opportunities. They're -- very much, as you know, they take a while for them to come to fruition, but we feel good about the model which is partnering with folks that need high-performance technology. And we'll continue to work those deals as we go through the next couple of quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great.\"), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"And I'll follow-up if I may. I was hoping that you could just help me with the accounting of the semicustom design wins. So if I remember properly, there was two that you expect in the back half of this year, and then one -- I thought it was the first half of next year.\\\\nSo Scorpio is one of those three? But that's next year; so that's the one for next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, let me help you out with the accounting -- I know that we've had several different pieces of information on the semicustom new design wins. So what we said is we'll have a total of three semicustom new design wins that will account for about -- let's call it $1.5 billion of revenue approximately over the next three to four years.\\\\nWe are starting the ramp of new business this coming quarter, this third quarter, and that will be one of the semicustom design wins. Scorpio is also a design win, and that, as our customer said, will be in 2017. And we'll give you more information about the third one as we have more visibility.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd do you have more design wins that you just haven't announced or mentioned timing of?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, we're trying to get out a little bit of the counting game, but I think overall, we're pleased with the semicustom pipeline. I think some of the questions that we've been asked are, do we believe we have design wins outside of game consoles, and the answer is yes. We have design wins outside of game consoles. I think we view the pipeline as good, and it's a business model that works well with our high-performance technology plans and our SoC capabilities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.

Lisa, I have a couple of questions on Zen. You gave some color in your prepared remarks about server opportunities for Zen starting in the first half of next year. Maybe you could give us a little color on potentially what markets you are going after there, where you see the opportunities?\\\\nIt seems to me that a lot of different moving parts in the cloud market with open power and ARM, and then custom CPUs from Intel, but a pretty big enterprise space that's x86 captive for you guys to go after. So I would just be interested to see what the strategy is going forward there and where the design wins might come from?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Matt. So, yes, let me give you a little bit of color how we see it. First of all, look, Zen is a brand-new CPU design and we had very ambitious goals for it. And given where we are today, it's actually coming up very well.\\\\nWe've demoed both desktop systems, and now we have server systems working in both our labs and our customers' labs. I would say as the progress of Zen is -- goes along in terms of validation, the customer interest has increased. And so, while we did close a number of design wins in the second quarter and we have a number more in the pipeline, as we go into the third quarter and more widespread availability.\\\\nOur view is, Zen is a general-purpose server architecture that can play in many different places. So you mentioned the cloud. I think that's certainly one target market given the growth there. We also see there are workloads that would be particularly -- fit well for sort of the performance areas that we're targeting. I think enterprise is also again very much a target area for Zen.\\\\nWhat we are looking for again is ensuring that we have a very high quality launch, and so we're working very closely with customers to make sure that we run their workloads and demonstrate the performance improvement that we expect. But as I said overall, it's going well, and we continue to work with customers to ensure that they see the benefits of Zen and working with AMD.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you for the color and it's good to hear. I guess another question on Zen more in the PC market -- because I think your prepared remarks focused a bit more on server -- but maybe you could give us a little bit of an update in the timing of desktop and notebook potential launches.\\\\nIt just seems to me going into the holiday season that it's still a little unclear as to where Zen is going to land relative to holiday ramps in the Western market and to Chinese New Year. So any color around that would be really helpful.\"), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content='Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes.'), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"No, that's a fair question, Matt. So we have been very focused on the server launch for first half of 2017. Desktop should launch before that. In terms of true volume availability, I believe it will be in the first quarter of 2017. We may ship some limited volume towards the end of the fourth quarter, based on how bring-up goes and the customer readiness.\\\\nBut again, if I look overall at what we are trying to do, I think the desktop product is very well-positioned for that high-end desktop segment, that enthusiast segment, in both channel and OEM, which is very much a segment that AMD knows well. And so that's where we would focus -- on desktop.\\\\nYou should expect a notebook version of Zen with integrated graphics in 2017, and that development is going on as well. And so I think it's just a time of a lot of activity around the Zen and the different Zen product families.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much.

I was looking at the implied guidance for Q4. You said the -- I guess for the full year, up low single digits. So, I mean, call it 3%. But it would imply Q4 down 16%/17% sequentially, and actually down on an absolute basis, lower than I would've thought. I think Q4 also has an extra week in it.\\\\nI was wondering if you could give us, I guess, some color on how you see the drivers, I guess, for seasonality going from Q3 to Q4 across both of the businesses, given that, I guess, the trajectory of the different product launches that we have in the back half? Like, how do you come to that number?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. Stacy, maybe I'll start and see if Devinder would like to add to it. So, look, our -- when we started the year, our expectation is that we would grow revenue in 2016 versus 2015, but we were coming off of a very low base in the first quarter. So we've been pleased with how it played out certainly in our second-quarter revenue and the third quarter revenue guidance.\\\\nOverall, the businesses are performing well, so we do expect both Computing and Graphics and EEFC to both grow for the year. I think the semicustom business is the large driver of the fourth quarter in terms of just how we see the overall business playing out. But the Computing and Graphics business is playing out as you might expect.\\\\nSo the second half should be seasonally higher, certainly with Polaris, and as we launch broader availability across the product line, as well as the seventh generation APUs as they go into back-to-school and holiday. So that's the way we should think about it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay.\"), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at your notebook shipments in the quarter. So they were up again sequentially -- I think they were up double digits in Q1; I think they were up in Q4 as well. So three quarters in a row of sequential increase. Obviously off a low base as well.\\\\nBut how confident are you -- like what's driving that? Is this -- is it actually sort of a sell-out that's actually driving the demand? Or is this sell-in into the channel? And how should we think about that potentially normalizing?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, so if you're talking about the notebook computing business, actually we are kind of pleased with how it performed. So if you look at it, overall, the -- our OEM customers have adopted our technologies, so we see that across both notebook and desktop, but presumably notebook.\\\\nWe are also making progress in commercial, and that was a very important initiative over the past five or six quarters. And so that's been nice to stabilize the business. And again, I don't believe it's a sell-in phenomenon. Actually it's consumption share that we see increasing. And I think we have a reasonable opportunity to add to that in the second half of the year. But it's really around our products in the platforms that we're putting together with the OEMs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. If I could ask one more really quick. I was just a little bit surprised at how much your wafer purchases at GlobalFoundries came down quarter-over-quarter, given the increase in notebooks as well as the timing of the Polaris launch. Any -- what -- should we read anything into that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think basically the purchases of the wafers are in line with product demand and mix of business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the other day we purchased about [$260 million] of wafers, and we are getting into the back half of the year, which as you can see, with our revenue guidance in Q3, is pretty strong.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer, Credit Suisse Group.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on orchestrating the turnaround. I guess, Lisa, my first question, I would kind of like to get your view on the news earlier this week around Softbank and ARM. You are sort of in a unique position because you are both kind of a partner with ARM as an ARM licensee. But if you look at your custom silicon business, especially on the x86 architecture, you could make the argument that you're a little bit of a competitor as well.\\\\nSo I'm kind of curious to know how you see kind of the reaction to that from a customer perspective? And does that change your view of how you might be able to monetize your own IP in the future?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn, thanks for the question. Look, I think it's a very interesting deal -- the ARM SoftBank deal. I think we have a lot of respect for ARM; they are a close partner. I'm not sure we would call them a competitor. Overall, they are a partner.\\\\nAs it relates to how we think about our IP, we really believe that our IP, particularly the high performance element of it on the microprocessor and the graphic side, is very unique, and in some sense, there are very few places in the industry where you have access to it. I think the applications that need it, whether you are talking about consumer applications or enterprise cloud applications, are growing. And so it's an opportunity for us to look for larger markets to monetize beyond just our own products.\\\\nAnd that's, in general, the way we think about IP monetization. We have a set of products that is very important to our business model, but our IP can go further than our products themselves. And so we would continue to look for opportunities to monetize our IP.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd again, I apologize if I missed this -- you commented on sort of your expectations for GPUs going into Q3 and for semicustom. How do you view the PC outlook within your total outlook above ATM? And I've got a quick follow-on.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. So let me talk about the PC market overall. I think our view of the PC market is pretty similar to others in the industry. We would say, overall for 2016, high-single digit decline. We have seen some positive signals, and we saw some positive data points from IDC earlier the last week. And then we saw a little bit of pickup in consumption in June from our OEM customers. But again, that was compared to -- let's call it a soft April/May.\\\\nOur view is OEM business looks okay. The channel for us is still weaker than we would like, and that's our view of the PC business. Even in that framework, we believe we can grow our Computing and Graphics business on the strength of the products. The Graphics products, we've talked about, as they ramp in the second half of the year. And on the Computing side as well, I think we have a number of new platforms, and back-to-school and holiday are important for us. So that's the way would characterize PCs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo, Lisa, not to put words in your mouth, but for Q3, PC's up but perhaps not up as much as seasonal? Is that the best way to think about it within your guide?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI would say roughly seasonal -- roughly seasonal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat's helpful. And then lastly, guys, I apologize, but Devinder, now that you've got revenue growth behind you and you've got some momentum here, how do we think about the gross margin progression from here and kind of the puts and takes? And I know there's lot of different dynamics there, including the mix of semicustom. But from these levels, how should we think about gross margin progression over the next, call it, two to four quarters?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, John, I think the way you think about it is, it is the mix of business, so that's a good observation. But also you see us making continuing investments in our roadmap in graphics and in other areas, and we believe that will help us improve the gross margin. And then as you look out longer-term, as you observe -- get beyond a couple of quarters and get into 2017, we do have the Zen product introduction coming up. We also have a product in the pro graphics area, and that should drive even higher gross margins compared to where we are today, given the mix will get better with those products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks. Well, thanks, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\"), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"- President and CEO    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, John.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore, Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. This is Sidney Ho asking -- calling in for Ross. Just follow up to -- with the last question by focusing on third quarter, you guided third-quarter gross margin to be flat, but the profile seem -- of revenue growth seems to be -- would suggest gross margin should decline on a mix adjusted basis.\\\\nHow should we think about gross margin by segment in Q3? What are some of the moving parts? And maybe follow-up to that, do you expect the gross margin of the new custom design wins ramping this quarter to have better or worse margins than your game console business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think that's well-put. I mean if you look overall when we have a higher mix of semicustom business, typically the gross margin is lower since the business model on the semicustom side has for the lower margin just the way the model is constructed. So keeping it flat at 31% with the guide in Q3 was variable in Q2. We were pretty pleased with that. And I think you're seeing some of the strength underlying the non-semicustom business is allowing us to keep it flat quarter-on-quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. And then my follow-up question is -- you guys talked about the Zen products at Computex and it's on track for launching in the first half of 2017. Can you talk about the impact on R&D expense and maybe on gross margin on the preparation of this launch over the next few quarters? And if you hit your revenue plan that you have thought about, at what point do you need to start increasing OpEx from the $330 million to $350 million level?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThe OpEx side of it, if I look at it from that standpoint, you have seen our OpEx actually go up; in Q3, we are guiding at the $350 million level with specific targeted investments we are making in key R&D areas and products, in particular the high performance roadmap that we have laid out. But we are also making some specific investments in the marketing area, given the new products that are coming out on the PC side as well as the GPU side, trying to attract end-users back to the AMD brand.\\\\nAnd I think you'll continue to see us do that. And that helps obviously with this new product underlying the better margins that you get with the fresh cycle, in particular with the new technology areas that we are putting our products in.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Maybe just one quick follow-up. For Q4 with an extra week in the fiscal quarter, should we expect OpEx to be at the high end of levels, that that will be enough -- that $350 million?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI'm not prepared -- you know, one of the things about OpEx as I always say even if you look at Q3, the OpEx is up on a guided basis at $350 million, but very much as I always say, we manage the OpEx pretty tightly. We've done that over the last several years, and obviously it gets modulated somewhat by revenue. Q3, our revenue is up 18%, OpEx is at $350 million and we'll talk about Q4 when we gather here in about 90 days.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI was also curious about GlobalFoundries being so low in Q2. And I guess have you guys finalized the 2016 wafer supply agreement? And can you talk more generally about which products -- how you are deciding which products are allocated to Global and TSMC? And is there anything that's exclusive to one or the other?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, several parts to it. I mean the working relationship, as Lisa said, with GlobalFoundries is very good. We continue to work through the 2016 WSA and that's not finalized; we're in the process of negotiating that. In the meantime, we continue to get delivery of wafers for the products that we need in line with the product demand and mix of business. And relative to your -- which products from which foundry, we typically do not share the source of foundry for any of our wafers or products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. That's fair. And then with regards to kind of thinking about next year's OpEx, when you look at the importance of a CPU that can attack the server market and can attack the high end of the sort of enthusiast CPU market, I guess I don't want you to necessarily be constrained by the R&D requirements of the last couple of years.\\\\nI mean, so how do you think about that? If you start to show some revenue traction, I mean, can you -- how much flexibility do you think there is on spending? I'm not asking for a number, but just qualitatively, how are you thinking about profitability versus investing in these opportunities next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe, I would say my engineers would be very happy to hear you say that.\"), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"So look, I appreciate the question. I think you've seen -- and Devinder said this -- we're going to be disciplined in OpEx. And as this quarter was an important turning point for us, to return to operating profitability, I think we have a nice sort of a view into Q3.\\\\nWe will look for opportunities to ensure that we are strategically placing the big bets in R&D, and both on the CPU and the GPU side. For example, this year, we have ramped up our investments on the graphics side with the formation of the Radeon Technologies Group, and what we're doing in both hardware and software -- very significant investments.\\\\nAnd similarly on the CPU side as well. So, I think we take very seriously our commitments in terms of profitability, but we will invest in the future and we'll continue to look for opportunities to balance those in the right way.\\\\nI don't know, Devinder, if you want to add --?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nNo, I think that's well-said. In 2017, obviously, as we get to the back half of the year, Q3 we have guided, we're getting to that -- get through Q3 and get into Q4. And at that point, we'll start thinking about where we want to place our bets as these are put in terms of the longer-term investments in 2017. Right now we're really focused on getting -- we got to non-GAAP operating profitability this quarter. We want to maintain that in Q3 and then we'll see what happens from there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Danely, Citigroup.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis is Marco Chan calling on behalf of Chris Danely.\"), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is, could you please update us on your expectations on the THATIC x86 server JV in China? Are there any potential legal risks with it, potentially Intel?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So relative to the server JV that we have with THATIC, as we stated before, we believe that our joint venture is operational. I think it's well underway. The technology that we're licensing is AMD technology, and so we don't have any issues relative to licensing. I think --\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. If I may add, I mean, one thing on the update, I guess, if you look at the prepared remarks and the commentary for Q3 is, we now expect, based on technology transfer milestone completion, to recognize $22 million to authorize a gain in Q3 and approximately $75 million for the year, which is higher than what we had said previously when we said it was $52 million for the year. So you can see it's incremental and therefore, as Lisa said, things are operationally on track and we continue to meet our technology transfer milestones from a date standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up -- I know you guys mentioned PCs and Graphics segment should be up year-over-year. Could you guys get into more detail, maybe talk about each segment individually, your trends for PCs versus GPUs?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we don't usually go into granularity about the subsegments of the business. I think it's fair to say that our PC business has stabilized. And what we're seeing now is the opportunity, as we go into the seasonally stronger half of the year on both the PC side and graphics side, on top of that with some new product launches, we believe that we will end up growing year-over-year. But again, we don't usually guide to the details within the segment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava, BMO.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish.\"), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on your Project Scorpio comment. I think it's going to be launched in 2017. And I think you had significantly higher performance and support 4K and V. So how should we think about the pricing on ASP that compares to what you have indicated on the current generation game console platform?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So, again we don't -- we wouldn't disclose anything that's incrementally more than what our customer has disclosed. So I think Microsoft has talked about their goals with Project Scorpio. I think we are in support of those goals. Given the performance level, you would imagine that there's more capability on chip, but I wouldn't want to go more than that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. As a follow-up -- I think your competitor has launched a comparable mainstream product -- I think GeForce 10 6P, so given the absence of your maybe higher performance part launching maybe in the second half, so how should we think about the rest of the year on the demand on your graphics side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we are feeling very good about our Polaris launch. This was our strategy from the beginning. I mean we laid out a strategy where we were going after the mainstream, and growth rate, really a new experience in terms of both capability and price point. And I think we've done that.\\\\nWe've also been very focused on DX 12 and our performance -- on new APIs like Vulcan. So we are happy with our competitiveness. I think it's played out as we thought it would do. Certainly our aspirations in GPU are to certainly have very competitive products across the entire product line. And so I've talked about working on Vega, which is the next generation high-end architecture.\\\\nBut in terms of our competitiveness, you know, we -- again, we've executed what we thought we were going to execute. And it seems like, from both customer reviews and analyst reviews, that it's pretty well-received by the market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay.

So EESC -- looks like you achieved operating income same level as third quarter of last year but with $45 million lower revenue. So just wondering how you got more profitable in this segment, given these are both strong game console quarters and also you've got annual price declines in game consoles, I assume. Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think if you look at the profitability, you've got to remember that in the EESC segment, we also have other businesses embedded for one, and also the investment we are making for the enterprise side of it, for the data center product that's coming out in 2017. So the profitability -- you're right about the observation, but profitability depends upon obviously -- the largest business we have in there right now is the semicustom business, but also the investments on the OpEx standpoint that we make year-on-year. And we talked about the targeted investments we are making in some of the product areas.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay.\"), Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"Great. But these are relatively older products that are embedded into enterprise products at the moment then, it sounds like. Okay, great. And then my follow-on is -- you are at a one-year cadence for GPUs now. Could you talk about expectations on how last year's R9300 series winds down and how that plays out? It looks like in Q2, it was really just a lack of a pause ahead of a known refresh. And do you expect sort of a sharp wind-down at some point? Or is it more gradual?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [77]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nActually, Ian, that's a good observation. The 390 series or the 300 series overall actually did do okay in the second quarter. We were also wondering whether there would be a pause prior to a new generation. I think we see it as a very orderly transition; it's actually one of our better product transitions as we go from the 300 series over to the 400 series.\\\\nSo again, nothing very spectacular to report other than the sellthrough has continued -- the sellthrough was good in the second quarter. And we believe that it's an orderly transition of the inventory.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [78]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay, great. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [79]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Ian.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [80]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Jaguar Bajwa from Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [81]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. Just a question on Q3. Could you just lay out which would be the fastest-growing sequential segment in Q3? Will that be the GPU business, CPU or semicustom? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [82]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar, I think what we would say is that our Q3 guidance is both semicustom and graphics will be the drivers of the sequential revenue growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [83]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thanks. And then could you just give a bit more clarity around Vega timing? And also what do you expect to be your differentiation here versus what Nvidia has done with Pascal?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [84]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAgain, I think we'll talk more about the details of the Vega architecture in time, but certainly Vega is a high-performance GPU that will use high-bandwidth memory as part of it. So, I would leave the details for a more -- as we go -- get closer to the Vega launch date.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [85]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Well, maybe just one final one then. When we get into the server CPU cycle with Zen, should we expect any kind of contribution from an APU format with CPU plus Vega? Because we're seeing a lot of acceleration now in the data center. Do you think that could be a key product for you guys which maybe your competitors may not have, bringing an APU to the server market for high-performance servers?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [86]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think it's fair to say that we do believe we can combine high-performance CPU with the high-performance GPU. As we look at our GPU compute in general, sort of our both professionals graphics and server markets for GPU, I think that will increasingly become an area of focus for us as we continue to grow the graphics business.\\\\nSo I think the answer is yes. I mean, obviously, it will come in time, but it's an area where combining the two technologies makes a lot of sense.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [87]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay.

And our third-quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, September 16, 2016. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that second quarter -- that the second-quarter 2016 was a 13-week quarter, and we expect to record our extra week in the fourth quarter of 2016.\\\\nToday\\'s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.\\\\nAdditionally, please note we will be referring to non-GAAP figures during this call except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and CFO commentary that we\\'ve posted on our website at quarterlyearnings.AMD.com.\\\\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements in today\\'s earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD\\'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 2016.\\\\nNow with that, I\\'d like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Ruth. And good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our ongoing focus on diversifying our business model and delivering great products is creating solid market and financial momentum. Looking at the second-quarter specifically, strong semicustom demand and better-than-seasonal graphic sales drove a 23% sequential revenue increase and our return to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWe also recorded our first full quarter licensing gain from our China server JV, THATIC, and improved our balance sheet with cash proceeds from the formation of our ATMP joint venture, with NFME. Looking at our Computing and Graphic segment, revenue decreased 5% sequentially, as stronger-than-seasonal GPU sales were offset by a decline in desktop processor sales.\\\\nFirst-half 2016 GPU sales increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, as the investments we have been making to develop leadership graphics hardware, software and drivers, combined with new marketing campaigns, are paying off.\\\\nOur strong second-quarter graphics performance was capped by the launch of our new Polaris based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June, which helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014. The Radeon RX family resets expectations around the experiences and features gamers now want in a mainstream GPU.\\\\nWe are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desk top GPUs, and Polaris based notebooks from our OEM customers. We also delivered our third straight quarter of sequential professionals graphics revenue growth and believe we gained share driven by increased adoption of FirePro graphics by OEMs as well as several cloud data center GPU compute wins.\\\\nIn client, mobile APUs sales increased for the third straight quarter, partially offsetting decreased desktop processor sales led by channel softness in China. Shipments of our recently launched seventh generation APUs are ramping well and outpacing sales of our six-generation APUs at this point in their lifecycle.\\\\nMore than 25 new seventh generation APU systems, including several premium designs, are expected to be widely available in the coming months from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, providing us with confidence in this part of our business as we enter the seasonally stronger second half of the year.\\\\nTurning to our enterprise embedded and semicustom segment, our 59% sequential revenue increase is the largest since our first full quarter of semicustom products shipments in 2013. As in the previous two years, we expect semicustom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semicustom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.\\\\nLast quarter at E3, Microsoft announced two new members of the Xbox One family powered by AMD. The Xbox One S is the slimmest Xbox console ever, and the first to support HDR. The system is expected to go on sale in the coming weeks. Microsoft also announced their next-generation game console, code-named Project Scorpio, for the 2017 holidays.\\\\nProject Scorpios is designed to be fully compatible with existing Xbox One software, while leveraging AMD\\'s leadership gaming technologies to create more immersive 4K and VR gaming experiences. Project Scorpio is one of the semicustom design wins we communicated previously.\\\\nOur next generation Zen processor products passed several key milestones in the quarter as well. I\\'m excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers\\' labs.\\\\nWe are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.\\\\nIn closing, over the last 18 months, we have been diligently executing our strategic plan to improve our financial performance by delivering great products, strengthening our customer relationships, and simplifying our business. In the past six months alone, we released our game-changing Polaris architecture, completed our ATMP JV transaction, announced a JV and IP licensing transaction with THATIC, and returned to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWhile we recognize we have more work to do, we believe that, based on the ongoing ramps of our semicustom SoCs, Polaris GPUs, and seventh generation APUs, we can deliver full-year revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on delivering our road map of high performance products and technologies, including Zen and our next generation Vega GPU architecture that can drive long-term growth.\\\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second-quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was a strong quarter, punctuated by better-than-expected financial performance, driven by demand for our semicustom SoCs and the closure of our ATMP joint venture transaction with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, which bolstered our cash position.\\\\nSecond-quarter revenue was $1.027 billion, up 23% sequentially, driven by higher sales of semicustom SoCs. The year-over-year revenue increase was 9% with higher sales in both reportable segments. Gross margin was 31%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of semicustom SoCs sales.\\\\nOperating expenses were $342 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased marketing investments. We also recognized a $26 million licensing gain associated with our JV with THATIC, and restructuring credits of $7 million, primarily related to facilities. We are pleased to report operating income of $3 million this quarter.\\\\nNet loss was $40 million with loss per share of $0.05, calculated using 794 million basic shares in the quarter. We recorded a pretax gain of $150 million related to the ATMP JV transaction, an equity loss of $3 million based on our 15% ownership stake, and taxes of $27 million related to the JV transaction. Adjusted EBITDA was a positive $36 million compared to negative $22 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments -- Computing and Graphics revenue was $435 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of client desktop processors and chipsets. Revenue was up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by higher client notebook Processor and Graphics sales.\\\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating loss was $81 million compared to $70 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower revenue. Enterprise, embedded and semicustom revenue was $592 million, up 59% from the prior quarter and 5% higher than the prior year, driven by higher semicustom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from [$16 million] in the prior quarter, driven by higher revenue and a $26 million IP licensing gain compared to a licensing gain of $7 million in the first quarter.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter. Inventory was $743 million, up $68 million or 10% from the prior quarter, and higher than guided, in support of expected higher semicustom sales in the third quarter.\\\\nIn the second quarter, we recorded a $62 million investment on our balance sheet related to our 15% ownership stake in the ATMP JV. Total wafer purchases from GlobalFoundries in the second quarter were 75 million and year-to-date, we have purchased 259 million.\\\\nDebt as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, and includes total borrowings of $226 million on our secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow in the second quarter was negative $106 million compared to a negative $68 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the inventory build in support of strong second-half revenue.\\\\nNow turning to the outlook, which is based on a 13-week fiscal quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by our graphics and semicustom products, including the ramp of new semicustom business; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million, due to an increase in R&D investments; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $22 million to maintain non-GAAP operating profitability; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes or other -- and other to be approximately $45 million; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately flat; and inventory to be approximately $700 million. And lastly, for the full-year 2016, we expect low-single digit revenue growth year-over-year.\\\\nIn closing, we are pleased with the progress we\\'ve made this quarter. We launched exciting new products in the second quarter, with more expected to come to help drive strong revenue growth and improved financial performance in the third quarter. We recognize there\\'s a lot more work to be done to return AMD to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation, and look forward to continuing our progress over the coming quarters.\\\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Devinder. Operator, if you could poll the audience please for a question-and-answer session?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================================================================\\\\nQuestions and Answers\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [1]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n(Operator Instructions) David Wong, Wells Fargo.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [2]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMy first question -- can you give us any detail on the ramp in dollar terms of revenues from new semicustom products in the September/December quarters, and what the seasonal pattern of these products might be?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, David. This is Lisa. Let me start with that. So, our semicustom business overall, we see as strong for the year. I think the predominant business is the current generation game consoles, and as they ramp into the second half and the stronger holiday season.\\\\nWe expect the seasonality of semicustoms to be similar to prior years. We\\'ll see a peak in the third quarter and a decline in the fourth quarter, and we will see the new business layer in starting in the third quarter. But I don\\'t expect that to change the seasonality pattern. So, we are building up for a strong holiday season overall.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Lisa. And since the launch of your Radeon 480 graphics product end of last month, have you been able to supply to demand for the cards? Or if not, when do you expect demand will rise to match supply?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [5]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So, David, we\\'re very pleased with the launch of the Radeon RX 480. We had good supply at major retailers on launch day. Since then, the demand has continued to be strong and so some of the retailers are out of supply. We do see that the 14 LPP yields are good and we\\'re ramping up production steeply.\\\\nSo we expect that will equalize as we go through the quarter. We\\'re also very soon going to launch the rest of the Radeon RX family. And so you\\'ll see three products in the third quarter in terms of overall product momentum.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDavid Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [6]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Thanks very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [7]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, David.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [8]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis, Jefferies.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [9]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. First one -- Lisa, maybe for you -- the China licensing deal was -- I thought it was creative and fascinating. Can you characterize kind of the pipeline of IP deals that you have or the technology deals? Is this it? Or do you have more in the pipe? Can you talk about timing or the types of deals you might be working on?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [10]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Mark. So the China JV, as you said, we announced it last quarter and it\\'s now in operation. It\\'s actually going well, so we\\'re on track for some of the important milestone deliveries that we had.\\\\nIn terms of the overall pipeline, I would say we have a nice set of interesting opportunities. They\\'re -- very much, as you know, they take a while for them to come to fruition, but we feel good about the model which is partnering with folks that need high-performance technology. And we\\'ll continue to work those deals as we go through the next couple of quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. And I\\'ll follow-up if I may. I was hoping that you could just help me with the accounting of the semicustom design wins. So if I remember properly, there was two that you expect in the back half of this year, and then one -- I thought it was the first half of next year.\\\\nSo Scorpio is one of those three? But that\\'s next year; so that\\'s the one for next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [12]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, let me help you out with the accounting -- I know that we\\'ve had several different pieces of information on the semicustom new design wins. So what we said is we\\'ll have a total of three semicustom new design wins that will account for about -- let\\'s call it $1.5 billion of revenue approximately over the next three to four years.\\\\nWe are starting the ramp of new business this coming quarter, this third quarter, and that will be one of the semicustom design wins. Scorpio is also a design win, and that, as our customer said, will be in 2017. And we\\'ll give you more information about the third one as we have more visibility.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [13]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd do you have more design wins that you just haven\\'t announced or mentioned timing of?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [14]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nWell, we\\'re trying to get out a little bit of the counting game, but I think overall, we\\'re pleased with the semicustom pipeline. I think some of the questions that we\\'ve been asked are, do we believe we have design wins outside of game consoles, and the answer is yes. We have design wins outside of game consoles. I think we view the pipeline as good, and it\\'s a business model that works well with our high-performance technology plans and our SoC capabilities.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [15]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. That\\'s very helpful.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [16]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Mark.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [17]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [18]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my questions. Lisa, I have a couple of questions on Zen. You gave some color in your prepared remarks about server opportunities for Zen starting in the first half of next year. Maybe you could give us a little color on potentially what markets you are going after there, where you see the opportunities?\\\\nIt seems to me that a lot of different moving parts in the cloud market with open power and ARM, and then custom CPUs from Intel, but a pretty big enterprise space that\\'s x86 captive for you guys to go after. So I would just be interested to see what the strategy is going forward there and where the design wins might come from?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Matt. So, yes, let me give you a little bit of color how we see it. First of all, look, Zen is a brand-new CPU design and we had very ambitious goals for it. And given where we are today, it\\'s actually coming up very well.\\\\nWe\\'ve demoed both desktop systems, and now we have server systems working in both our labs and our customers\\' labs. I would say as the progress of Zen is -- goes along in terms of validation, the customer interest has increased. And so, while we did close a number of design wins in the second quarter and we have a number more in the pipeline, as we go into the third quarter and more widespread availability.\\\\nOur view is, Zen is a general-purpose server architecture that can play in many different places. So you mentioned the cloud. I think that\\'s certainly one target market given the growth there. We also see there are workloads that would be particularly -- fit well for sort of the performance areas that we\\'re targeting. I think enterprise is also again very much a target area for Zen.\\\\nWhat we are looking for again is ensuring that we have a very high quality launch, and so we\\'re working very closely with customers to make sure that we run their workloads and demonstrate the performance improvement that we expect. But as I said overall, it\\'s going well, and we continue to work with customers to ensure that they see the benefits of Zen and working with AMD.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you for the color and it\\'s good to hear. I guess another question on Zen more in the PC market -- because I think your prepared remarks focused a bit more on server -- but maybe you could give us a little bit of an update in the timing of desktop and notebook potential launches.\\\\nIt just seems to me going into the holiday season that it\\'s still a little unclear as to where Zen is going to land relative to holiday ramps in the Western market and to Chinese New Year. So any color around that would be really helpful. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. No, that\\'s a fair question, Matt. So we have been very focused on the server launch for first half of 2017. Desktop should launch before that. In terms of true volume availability, I believe it will be in the first quarter of 2017. We may ship some limited volume towards the end of the fourth quarter, based on how bring-up goes and the customer readiness.\\\\nBut again, if I look overall at what we are trying to do, I think the desktop product is very well-positioned for that high-end desktop segment, that enthusiast segment, in both channel and OEM, which is very much a segment that AMD knows well. And so that\\'s where we would focus -- on desktop.\\\\nYou should expect a notebook version of Zen with integrated graphics in 2017, and that development is going on as well. And so I think it\\'s just a time of a lot of activity around the Zen and the different Zen product families.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much. Congratulations on the return to profitability.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [23]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Matt.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [24]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [25]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [26]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my questions. I was looking at the implied guidance for Q4. You said the -- I guess for the full year, up low single digits. So, I mean, call it 3%. But it would imply Q4 down 16%/17% sequentially, and actually down on an absolute basis, lower than I would\\'ve thought. I think Q4 also has an extra week in it.\\\\nI was wondering if you could give us, I guess, some color on how you see the drivers, I guess, for seasonality going from Q3 to Q4 across both of the businesses, given that, I guess, the trajectory of the different product launches that we have in the back half? Like, how do you come to that number?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. Stacy, maybe I\\'ll start and see if Devinder would like to add to it. So, look, our -- when we started the year, our expectation is that we would grow revenue in 2016 versus 2015, but we were coming off of a very low base in the first quarter. So we\\'ve been pleased with how it played out certainly in our second-quarter revenue and the third quarter revenue guidance.\\\\nOverall, the businesses are performing well, so we do expect both Computing and Graphics and EEFC to both grow for the year. I think the semicustom business is the large driver of the fourth quarter in terms of just how we see the overall business playing out. But the Computing and Graphics business is playing out as you might expect.\\\\nSo the second half should be seasonally higher, certainly with Polaris, and as we launch broader availability across the product line, as well as the seventh generation APUs as they go into back-to-school and holiday. So that\\'s the way we should think about it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at your notebook shipments in the quarter. So they were up again sequentially -- I think they were up double digits in Q1; I think they were up in Q4 as well. So three quarters in a row of sequential increase. Obviously off a low base as well.\\\\nBut how confident are you -- like what\\'s driving that? Is this -- is it actually sort of a sell-out that\\'s actually driving the demand? Or is this sell-in into the channel? And how should we think about that potentially normalizing?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, so if you\\'re talking about the notebook computing business, actually we are kind of pleased with how it performed. So if you look at it, overall, the -- our OEM customers have adopted our technologies, so we see that across both notebook and desktop, but presumably notebook.\\\\nWe are also making progress in commercial, and that was a very important initiative over the past five or six quarters. And so that\\'s been nice to stabilize the business. And again, I don\\'t believe it\\'s a sell-in phenomenon. Actually it\\'s consumption share that we see increasing. And I think we have a reasonable opportunity to add to that in the second half of the year. But it\\'s really around our products in the platforms that we\\'re putting together with the OEMs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. If I could ask one more really quick. I was just a little bit surprised at how much your wafer purchases at GlobalFoundries came down quarter-over-quarter, given the increase in notebooks as well as the timing of the Polaris launch. Any -- what -- should we read anything into that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think basically the purchases of the wafers are in line with product demand and mix of business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the other day we purchased about [$260 million] of wafers, and we are getting into the back half of the year, which as you can see, with our revenue guidance in Q3, is pretty strong.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer, Credit Suisse Group.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on orchestrating the turnaround. I guess, Lisa, my first question, I would kind of like to get your view on the news earlier this week around Softbank and ARM. You are sort of in a unique position because you are both kind of a partner with ARM as an ARM licensee. But if you look at your custom silicon business, especially on the x86 architecture, you could make the argument that you\\'re a little bit of a competitor as well.\\\\nSo I\\'m kind of curious to know how you see kind of the reaction to that from a customer perspective? And does that change your view of how you might be able to monetize your own IP in the future?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn, thanks for the question. Look, I think it\\'s a very interesting deal -- the ARM SoftBank deal. I think we have a lot of respect for ARM; they are a close partner. I\\'m not sure we would call them a competitor. Overall, they are a partner.\\\\nAs it relates to how we think about our IP, we really believe that our IP, particularly the high performance element of it on the microprocessor and the graphic side, is very unique, and in some sense, there are very few places in the industry where you have access to it. I think the applications that need it, whether you are talking about consumer applications or enterprise cloud applications, are growing. And so it\\'s an opportunity for us to look for larger markets to monetize beyond just our own products.\\\\nAnd that\\'s, in general, the way we think about IP monetization. We have a set of products that is very important to our business model, but our IP can go further than our products themselves. And so we would continue to look for opportunities to monetize our IP.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd again, I apologize if I missed this -- you commented on sort of your expectations for GPUs going into Q3 and for semicustom. How do you view the PC outlook within your total outlook above ATM? And I\\'ve got a quick follow-on.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. So let me talk about the PC market overall. I think our view of the PC market is pretty similar to others in the industry. We would say, overall for 2016, high-single digit decline. We have seen some positive signals, and we saw some positive data points from IDC earlier the last week. And then we saw a little bit of pickup in consumption in June from our OEM customers. But again, that was compared to -- let\\'s call it a soft April/May.\\\\nOur view is OEM business looks okay. The channel for us is still weaker than we would like, and that\\'s our view of the PC business. Even in that framework, we believe we can grow our Computing and Graphics business on the strength of the products. The Graphics products, we\\'ve talked about, as they ramp in the second half of the year. And on the Computing side as well, I think we have a number of new platforms, and back-to-school and holiday are important for us. So that\\'s the way would characterize PCs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo, Lisa, not to put words in your mouth, but for Q3, PC\\'s up but perhaps not up as much as seasonal? Is that the best way to think about it within your guide?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI would say roughly seasonal -- roughly seasonal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s helpful. And then lastly, guys, I apologize, but Devinder, now that you\\'ve got revenue growth behind you and you\\'ve got some momentum here, how do we think about the gross margin progression from here and kind of the puts and takes? And I know there\\'s lot of different dynamics there, including the mix of semicustom. But from these levels, how should we think about gross margin progression over the next, call it, two to four quarters?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, John, I think the way you think about it is, it is the mix of business, so that\\'s a good observation. But also you see us making continuing investments in our roadmap in graphics and in other areas, and we believe that will help us improve the gross margin. And then as you look out longer-term, as you observe -- get beyond a couple of quarters and get into 2017, we do have the Zen product introduction coming up. We also have a product in the pro graphics area, and that should drive even higher gross margins compared to where we are today, given the mix will get better with those products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks. Well, thanks, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [43]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, John.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [44]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRoss Seymore, Deutsche Bank.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [45]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. This is Sidney Ho asking -- calling in for Ross. Just follow up to -- with the last question by focusing on third quarter, you guided third-quarter gross margin to be flat, but the profile seem -- of revenue growth seems to be -- would suggest gross margin should decline on a mix adjusted basis.\\\\nHow should we think about gross margin by segment in Q3? What are some of the moving parts? And maybe follow-up to that, do you expect the gross margin of the new custom design wins ramping this quarter to have better or worse margins than your game console business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think that\\'s well-put. I mean if you look overall when we have a higher mix of semicustom business, typically the gross margin is lower since the business model on the semicustom side has for the lower margin just the way the model is constructed. So keeping it flat at 31% with the guide in Q3 was variable in Q2. We were pretty pleased with that. And I think you\\'re seeing some of the strength underlying the non-semicustom business is allowing us to keep it flat quarter-on-quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. And then my follow-up question is -- you guys talked about the Zen products at Computex and it\\'s on track for launching in the first half of 2017. Can you talk about the impact on R&D expense and maybe on gross margin on the preparation of this launch over the next few quarters? And if you hit your revenue plan that you have thought about, at what point do you need to start increasing OpEx from the $330 million to $350 million level?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThe OpEx side of it, if I look at it from that standpoint, you have seen our OpEx actually go up; in Q3, we are guiding at the $350 million level with specific targeted investments we are making in key R&D areas and products, in particular the high performance roadmap that we have laid out. But we are also making some specific investments in the marketing area, given the new products that are coming out on the PC side as well as the GPU side, trying to attract end-users back to the AMD brand.\\\\nAnd I think you\\'ll continue to see us do that. And that helps obviously with this new product underlying the better margins that you get with the fresh cycle, in particular with the new technology areas that we are putting our products in.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Maybe just one quick follow-up. For Q4 with an extra week in the fiscal quarter, should we expect OpEx to be at the high end of levels, that that will be enough -- that $350 million?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI\\'m not prepared -- you know, one of the things about OpEx as I always say even if you look at Q3, the OpEx is up on a guided basis at $350 million, but very much as I always say, we manage the OpEx pretty tightly. We\\'ve done that over the last several years, and obviously it gets modulated somewhat by revenue. Q3, our revenue is up 18%, OpEx is at $350 million and we\\'ll talk about Q4 when we gather here in about 90 days.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI was also curious about GlobalFoundries being so low in Q2. And I guess have you guys finalized the 2016 wafer supply agreement? And can you talk more generally about which products -- how you are deciding which products are allocated to Global and TSMC? And is there anything that\\'s exclusive to one or the other?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, several parts to it. I mean the working relationship, as Lisa said, with GlobalFoundries is very good. We continue to work through the 2016 WSA and that\\'s not finalized; we\\'re in the process of negotiating that. In the meantime, we continue to get delivery of wafers for the products that we need in line with the product demand and mix of business. And relative to your -- which products from which foundry, we typically do not share the source of foundry for any of our wafers or products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. That\\'s fair. And then with regards to kind of thinking about next year\\'s OpEx, when you look at the importance of a CPU that can attack the server market and can attack the high end of the sort of enthusiast CPU market, I guess I don\\'t want you to necessarily be constrained by the R&D requirements of the last couple of years.\\\\nI mean, so how do you think about that? If you start to show some revenue traction, I mean, can you -- how much flexibility do you think there is on spending? I\\'m not asking for a number, but just qualitatively, how are you thinking about profitability versus investing in these opportunities next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe, I would say my engineers would be very happy to hear you say that. So look, I appreciate the question. I think you\\'ve seen -- and Devinder said this -- we\\'re going to be disciplined in OpEx. And as this quarter was an important turning point for us, to return to operating profitability, I think we have a nice sort of a view into Q3.\\\\nWe will look for opportunities to ensure that we are strategically placing the big bets in R&D, and both on the CPU and the GPU side. For example, this year, we have ramped up our investments on the graphics side with the formation of the Radeon Technologies Group, and what we\\'re doing in both hardware and software -- very significant investments.\\\\nAnd similarly on the CPU side as well. So, I think we take very seriously our commitments in terms of profitability, but we will invest in the future and we\\'ll continue to look for opportunities to balance those in the right way.\\\\nI don\\'t know, Devinder, if you want to add --?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nNo, I think that\\'s well-said. In 2017, obviously, as we get to the back half of the year, Q3 we have guided, we\\'re getting to that -- get through Q3 and get into Q4. And at that point, we\\'ll start thinking about where we want to place our bets as these are put in terms of the longer-term investments in 2017. Right now we\\'re really focused on getting -- we got to non-GAAP operating profitability this quarter. We want to maintain that in Q3 and then we\\'ll see what happens from there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [59]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nChristopher Danely, Citigroup.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [60]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis is Marco Chan calling on behalf of Chris Danely. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is, could you please update us on your expectations on the THATIC x86 server JV in China? Are there any potential legal risks with it, potentially Intel?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So relative to the server JV that we have with THATIC, as we stated before, we believe that our joint venture is operational. I think it\\'s well underway. The technology that we\\'re licensing is AMD technology, and so we don\\'t have any issues relative to licensing. I think --\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. If I may add, I mean, one thing on the update, I guess, if you look at the prepared remarks and the commentary for Q3 is, we now expect, based on technology transfer milestone completion, to recognize $22 million to authorize a gain in Q3 and approximately $75 million for the year, which is higher than what we had said previously when we said it was $52 million for the year. So you can see it\\'s incremental and therefore, as Lisa said, things are operationally on track and we continue to meet our technology transfer milestones from a date standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat\\'s very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up -- I know you guys mentioned PCs and Graphics segment should be up year-over-year. Could you guys get into more detail, maybe talk about each segment individually, your trends for PCs versus GPUs?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we don\\'t usually go into granularity about the subsegments of the business. I think it\\'s fair to say that our PC business has stabilized. And what we\\'re seeing now is the opportunity, as we go into the seasonally stronger half of the year on both the PC side and graphics side, on top of that with some new product launches, we believe that we will end up growing year-over-year. But again, we don\\'t usually guide to the details within the segment.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [65]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [66]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAmbrish Srivastava, BMO.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [67]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThis is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on your Project Scorpio comment. I think it\\'s going to be launched in 2017. And I think you had significantly higher performance and support 4K and V. So how should we think about the pricing on ASP that compares to what you have indicated on the current generation game console platform?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [68]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So, again we don\\'t -- we wouldn\\'t disclose anything that\\'s incrementally more than what our customer has disclosed. So I think Microsoft has talked about their goals with Project Scorpio. I think we are in support of those goals. Given the performance level, you would imagine that there\\'s more capability on chip, but I wouldn\\'t want to go more than that.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [69]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. As a follow-up -- I think your competitor has launched a comparable mainstream product -- I think GeForce 10 6P, so given the absence of your maybe higher performance part launching maybe in the second half, so how should we think about the rest of the year on the demand on your graphics side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we are feeling very good about our Polaris launch. This was our strategy from the beginning. I mean we laid out a strategy where we were going after the mainstream, and growth rate, really a new experience in terms of both capability and price point. And I think we\\'ve done that.\\\\nWe\\'ve also been very focused on DX 12 and our performance -- on new APIs like Vulcan. So we are happy with our competitiveness. I think it\\'s played out as we thought it would do. Certainly our aspirations in GPU are to certainly have very competitive products across the entire product line. And so I\\'ve talked about working on Vega, which is the next generation high-end architecture.\\\\nBut in terms of our competitiveness, you know, we -- again, we\\'ve executed what we thought we were going to execute. And it seems like, from both customer reviews and analyst reviews, that it\\'s pretty well-received by the market.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [71]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [72]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator, we\\'ll take two more callers, please.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [73]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing, MKM Partners.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [74]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, thank you for fitting me in. So EESC -- looks like you achieved operating income same level as third quarter of last year but with $45 million lower revenue. So just wondering how you got more profitable in this segment, given these are both strong game console quarters and also you\\'ve got annual price declines in game consoles, I assume. Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [75]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think if you look at the profitability, you\\'ve got to remember that in the EESC segment, we also have other businesses embedded for one, and also the investment we are making for the enterprise side of it, for the data center product that\\'s coming out in 2017. So the profitability -- you\\'re right about the observation, but profitability depends upon obviously -- the largest business we have in there right now is the semicustom business, but also the investments on the OpEx standpoint that we make year-on-year. And we talked about the targeted investments we are making in some of the product areas.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [76]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. But these are relatively older products that are embedded into enterprise products at the moment then, it sounds like. Okay, great. And then my follow-on is -- you are at a one-year cadence for GPUs now. Could you talk about expectations on how last year\\'s R9300 series winds down and how that plays out? It looks like in Q2, it was really just a lack of a pause ahead of a known refresh. And do you expect sort of a sharp wind-down at some point? Or is it more gradual?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [77]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nActually, Ian, that\\'s a good observation. The 390 series or the 300 series overall actually did do okay in the second quarter. We were also wondering whether there would be a pause prior to a new generation. I think we see it as a very orderly transition; it\\'s actually one of our better product transitions as we go from the 300 series over to the 400 series.\\\\nSo again, nothing very spectacular to report other than the sellthrough has continued -- the sellthrough was good in the second quarter. And we believe that it\\'s an orderly transition of the inventory.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nIan Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [78]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay, great. Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [79]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks, Ian.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [80]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Jaguar Bajwa from Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [81]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. Just a question on Q3. Could you just lay out which would be the fastest-growing sequential segment in Q3? Will that be the GPU business, CPU or semicustom? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [82]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar, I think what we would say is that our Q3 guidance is both semicustom and graphics will be the drivers of the sequential revenue growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [83]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thanks. And then could you just give a bit more clarity around Vega timing? And also what do you expect to be your differentiation here versus what Nvidia has done with Pascal?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [84]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAgain, I think we\\'ll talk more about the details of the Vega architecture in time, but certainly Vega is a high-performance GPU that will use high-bandwidth memory as part of it. So, I would leave the details for a more -- as we go -- get closer to the Vega launch date.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [85]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Well, maybe just one final one then. When we get into the server CPU cycle with Zen, should we expect any kind of contribution from an APU format with CPU plus Vega? Because we\\'re seeing a lot of acceleration now in the data center. Do you think that could be a key product for you guys which maybe your competitors may not have, bringing an APU to the server market for high-performance servers?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [86]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think it\\'s fair to say that we do believe we can combine high-performance CPU with the high-performance GPU. As we look at our GPU compute in general, sort of our both professionals graphics and server markets for GPU, I think that will increasingly become an area of focus for us as we continue to grow the graphics business.\\\\nSo I think the answer is yes. I mean, obviously, it will come in time, but it\\'s an area where combining the two technologies makes a lot of sense.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [87]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [88]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nRuth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Chief Human Resources Officer and SVP of Corporate Communications and IR    [89]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator, that concludes the question-and-answer session. If you wouldn\\'t mind wrapping up the call, please?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [90]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nCertainly. That concludes today\\'s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

       " Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"And good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our ongoing focus on diversifying our business model and delivering great products is creating solid market and financial momentum. Looking at the second-quarter specifically, strong semicustom demand and better-than-seasonal graphic sales drove a 23% sequential revenue increase and our return to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWe also recorded our first full quarter licensing gain from our China server JV, THATIC, and improved our balance sheet with cash proceeds from the formation of our ATMP joint venture, with NFME. Looking at our Computing and Graphic segment, revenue decreased 5% sequentially, as stronger-than-seasonal GPU sales were offset by a decline in desktop processor sales.\\\\nFirst-half 2016 GPU sales increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, as the investments we have been making to develop leadership graphics hardware, software and drivers, combined with new marketing campaigns, are paying off.\\\\nOur strong second-quarter graphics performance was capped by the launch of our new Polaris based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June, which helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014. The Radeon RX family resets expectations around the experiences and features gamers now want in a mainstream GPU.\\\\nWe are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desk top GPUs, and Polaris based notebooks from our OEM customers. We also delivered our third straight quarter of sequential professionals graphics revenue growth and believe we gained share driven by increased adoption of FirePro graphics by OEMs as well as several cloud data center GPU compute wins.\\\\nIn client, mobile APUs sales increased for the third straight quarter, partially offsetting decreased desktop processor sales led by channel softness in China. Shipments of our recently launched seventh generation APUs are ramping well and outpacing sales of our six-generation APUs at this point in their lifecycle.\\\\nMore than 25 new seventh generation APU systems, including several premium designs, are expected to be widely available in the coming months from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, providing us with confidence in this part of our business as we enter the seasonally stronger second half of the year.\\\\nTurning to our enterprise embedded and semicustom segment, our 59% sequential revenue increase is the largest since our first full quarter of semicustom products shipments in 2013. As in the previous two years, we expect semicustom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semicustom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.\\\\nLast quarter at E3, Microsoft announced two new members of the Xbox One family powered by AMD. The Xbox One S is the slimmest Xbox console ever, and the first to support HDR. The system is expected to go on sale in the coming weeks. Microsoft also announced their next-generation game console, code-named Project Scorpio, for the 2017 holidays.\\\\nProject Scorpios is designed to be fully compatible with existing Xbox One software, while leveraging AMD's leadership gaming technologies to create more immersive 4K and VR gaming experiences. Project Scorpio is one of the semicustom design wins we communicated previously.\\\\nOur next generation Zen processor products passed several key milestones in the quarter as well. I'm excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers' labs.\\\\nWe are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.\\\\nIn closing, over the last 18 months, we have been diligently executing our strategic plan to improve our financial performance by delivering great products, strengthening our customer relationships, and simplifying our business. In the past six months alone, we released our game-changing Polaris architecture, completed our ATMP JV transaction, announced a JV and IP licensing transaction with THATIC, and returned to non-GAAP operating profitability.\\\\nWhile we recognize we have more work to do, we believe that, based on the ongoing ramps of our semicustom SoCs, Polaris GPUs, and seventh generation APUs, we can deliver full-year revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on delivering our road map of high performance products and technologies, including Zen and our next generation Vega GPU architecture that can drive long-term growth.\\\\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second-quarter financial performance.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [4]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was a strong quarter, punctuated by better-than-expected financial performance, driven by demand for our semicustom SoCs and the closure of our ATMP joint venture transaction with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, which bolstered our cash position.\\\\nSecond-quarter revenue was $1.027 billion, up 23% sequentially, driven by higher sales of semicustom SoCs. The year-over-year revenue increase was 9% with higher sales in both reportable segments. Gross margin was 31%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of semicustom SoCs sales.\\\\nOperating expenses were $342 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased marketing investments. We also recognized a $26 million licensing gain associated with our JV with THATIC, and restructuring credits of $7 million, primarily related to facilities. We are pleased to report operating income of $3 million this quarter.\\\\nNet loss was $40 million with loss per share of $0.05, calculated using 794 million basic shares in the quarter. We recorded a pretax gain of $150 million related to the ATMP JV transaction, an equity loss of $3 million based on our 15% ownership stake, and taxes of $27 million related to the JV transaction. Adjusted EBITDA was a positive $36 million compared to negative $22 million in the prior quarter.\\\\nNow turning to the business segments -- Computing and Graphics revenue was $435 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of client desktop processors and chipsets. Revenue was up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by higher client notebook Processor and Graphics sales.\\\\nComputing and Graphics segment operating loss was $81 million compared to $70 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower revenue. Enterprise, embedded and semicustom revenue was $592 million, up 59% from the prior quarter and 5% higher than the prior year, driven by higher semicustom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from [$16 million] in the prior quarter, driven by higher revenue and a $26 million IP licensing gain compared to a licensing gain of $7 million in the first quarter.\\\\nTurning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter. Inventory was $743 million, up $68 million or 10% from the prior quarter, and higher than guided, in support of expected higher semicustom sales in the third quarter.\\\\nIn the second quarter, we recorded a $62 million investment on our balance sheet related to our 15% ownership stake in the ATMP JV. Total wafer purchases from GlobalFoundries in the second quarter were 75 million and year-to-date, we have purchased 259 million.\\\\nDebt as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, and includes total borrowings of $226 million on our secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow in the second quarter was negative $106 million compared to a negative $68 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the inventory build in support of strong second-half revenue.\\\\nNow turning to the outlook, which is based on a 13-week fiscal quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by our graphics and semicustom products, including the ramp of new semicustom business; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million, due to an increase in R&D investments; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $22 million to maintain non-GAAP operating profitability; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes or other -- and other to be approximately $45 million; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately flat; and inventory to be approximately $700 million. And lastly, for the full-year 2016, we expect low-single digit revenue growth year-over-year.\\\\nIn closing, we are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. We launched exciting new products in the second quarter, with more expected to come to help drive strong revenue growth and improved financial performance in the third quarter. We recognize there's a lot more work to be done to return AMD to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation, and look forward to continuing our progress over the coming quarters.\\\\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Ruth.

First one -- Lisa, maybe for you -- the China licensing deal was -- I thought it was creative and fascinating.

It's actually going well, so we're on track for some of the important milestone deliveries that we had.\\\\nIn terms of the overall pipeline, I would say we have a nice set of interesting opportunities. They're -- very much, as you know, they take a while for them to come to fruition, but we feel good about the model which is partnering with folks that need high-performance technology. And we'll continue to work those deals as we go through the next couple of quarters.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [11]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay.

I was hoping that you could just help me with the accounting of the semicustom design wins. So if I remember properly, there was two that you expect in the back half of this year, and then one -- I thought it was the first half of next year.\\\\nSo Scorpio is one of those three?

So what we said is we'll have a total of three semicustom new design wins that will account for about -- let's call it $1.5 billion of revenue approximately over the next three to four years.\\\\nWe are starting the ramp of new business this coming quarter, this third quarter, and that will be one of the semicustom design wins. Scorpio is also a design win, and that, as our customer said, will be in 2017.

Lisa, I have a couple of questions on Zen. You gave some color in your prepared remarks about server opportunities for Zen starting in the first half of next year. Maybe you could give us a little color on potentially what markets you are going after there, where you see the opportunities?\\\\nIt seems to me that a lot of different moving parts in the cloud market with open power and ARM, and then custom CPUs from Intel, but a pretty big enterprise space that's x86 captive for you guys to go after. So I would just be interested to see what the strategy is going forward there and where the design wins might come from?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [19]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure, Matt. So, yes, let me give you a little bit of color how we see it. First of all, look, Zen is a brand-new CPU design and we had very ambitious goals for it. And given where we are today, it's actually coming up very well.\\\\nWe've demoed both desktop systems, and now we have server systems working in both our labs and our customers' labs. I would say as the progress of Zen is -- goes along in terms of validation, the customer interest has increased. And so, while we did close a number of design wins in the second quarter and we have a number more in the pipeline, as we go into the third quarter and more widespread availability.\\\\nOur view is, Zen is a general-purpose server architecture that can play in many different places. So you mentioned the cloud. I think that's certainly one target market given the growth there. We also see there are workloads that would be particularly -- fit well for sort of the performance areas that we're targeting. I think enterprise is also again very much a target area for Zen.\\\\nWhat we are looking for again is ensuring that we have a very high quality launch, and so we're working very closely with customers to make sure that we run their workloads and demonstrate the performance improvement that we expect. But as I said overall, it's going well, and we continue to work with customers to ensure that they see the benefits of Zen and working with AMD.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [20]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you for the color and it's good to hear. I guess another question on Zen more in the PC market -- because I think your prepared remarks focused a bit more on server -- but maybe you could give us a little bit of an update in the timing of desktop and notebook potential launches.\\\\nIt just seems to me going into the holiday season that it's still a little unclear as to where Zen is going to land relative to holiday ramps in the Western market and to Chinese New Year. So any color around that would be really helpful.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content='Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [21]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"No, that's a fair question, Matt. So we have been very focused on the server launch for first half of 2017. Desktop should launch before that. In terms of true volume availability, I believe it will be in the first quarter of 2017. We may ship some limited volume towards the end of the fourth quarter, based on how bring-up goes and the customer readiness.\\\\nBut again, if I look overall at what we are trying to do, I think the desktop product is very well-positioned for that high-end desktop segment, that enthusiast segment, in both channel and OEM, which is very much a segment that AMD knows well. And so that's where we would focus -- on desktop.\\\\nYou should expect a notebook version of Zen with integrated graphics in 2017, and that development is going on as well. And so I think it's just a time of a lot of activity around the Zen and the different Zen product families.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMatt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [22]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you very much.

I was looking at the implied guidance for Q4. You said the -- I guess for the full year, up low single digits. So, I mean, call it 3%. But it would imply Q4 down 16%/17% sequentially, and actually down on an absolute basis, lower than I would've thought. I think Q4 also has an extra week in it.\\\\nI was wondering if you could give us, I guess, some color on how you see the drivers, I guess, for seasonality going from Q3 to Q4 across both of the businesses, given that, I guess, the trajectory of the different product launches that we have in the back half? Like, how do you come to that number?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [27]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. Stacy, maybe I'll start and see if Devinder would like to add to it. So, look, our -- when we started the year, our expectation is that we would grow revenue in 2016 versus 2015, but we were coming off of a very low base in the first quarter. So we've been pleased with how it played out certainly in our second-quarter revenue and the third quarter revenue guidance.\\\\nOverall, the businesses are performing well, so we do expect both Computing and Graphics and EEFC to both grow for the year. I think the semicustom business is the large driver of the fourth quarter in terms of just how we see the overall business playing out. But the Computing and Graphics business is playing out as you might expect.\\\\nSo the second half should be seasonally higher, certainly with Polaris, and as we launch broader availability across the product line, as well as the seventh generation APUs as they go into back-to-school and holiday. So that's the way we should think about it.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [28]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'company': 'AMD', 'date': datetime.date(2016, 7, 21), 'quarter': 'Q2 2016'}, page_content=\"Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at your notebook shipments in the quarter. So they were up again sequentially -- I think they were up double digits in Q1; I think they were up in Q4 as well. So three quarters in a row of sequential increase. Obviously off a low base as well.\\\\nBut how confident are you -- like what's driving that? Is this -- is it actually sort of a sell-out that's actually driving the demand? Or is this sell-in into the channel? And how should we think about that potentially normalizing?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [29]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, so if you're talking about the notebook computing business, actually we are kind of pleased with how it performed. So if you look at it, overall, the -- our OEM customers have adopted our technologies, so we see that across both notebook and desktop, but presumably notebook.\\\\nWe are also making progress in commercial, and that was a very important initiative over the past five or six quarters. And so that's been nice to stabilize the business. And again, I don't believe it's a sell-in phenomenon. Actually it's consumption share that we see increasing. And I think we have a reasonable opportunity to add to that in the second half of the year. But it's really around our products in the platforms that we're putting together with the OEMs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [30]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGot it. If I could ask one more really quick. I was just a little bit surprised at how much your wafer purchases at GlobalFoundries came down quarter-over-quarter, given the increase in notebooks as well as the timing of the Polaris launch. Any -- what -- should we read anything into that?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [31]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI think basically the purchases of the wafers are in line with product demand and mix of business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the other day we purchased about [$260 million] of wafers, and we are getting into the back half of the year, which as you can see, with our revenue guidance in Q3, is pretty strong.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nStacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [32]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThank you, guys.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [33]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer, Credit Suisse Group.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [34]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on orchestrating the turnaround. I guess, Lisa, my first question, I would kind of like to get your view on the news earlier this week around Softbank and ARM. You are sort of in a unique position because you are both kind of a partner with ARM as an ARM licensee. But if you look at your custom silicon business, especially on the x86 architecture, you could make the argument that you're a little bit of a competitor as well.\\\\nSo I'm kind of curious to know how you see kind of the reaction to that from a customer perspective? And does that change your view of how you might be able to monetize your own IP in the future?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [35]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn, thanks for the question. Look, I think it's a very interesting deal -- the ARM SoftBank deal. I think we have a lot of respect for ARM; they are a close partner. I'm not sure we would call them a competitor. Overall, they are a partner.\\\\nAs it relates to how we think about our IP, we really believe that our IP, particularly the high performance element of it on the microprocessor and the graphic side, is very unique, and in some sense, there are very few places in the industry where you have access to it. I think the applications that need it, whether you are talking about consumer applications or enterprise cloud applications, are growing. And so it's an opportunity for us to look for larger markets to monetize beyond just our own products.\\\\nAnd that's, in general, the way we think about IP monetization. We have a set of products that is very important to our business model, but our IP can go further than our products themselves. And so we would continue to look for opportunities to monetize our IP.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [36]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAnd again, I apologize if I missed this -- you commented on sort of your expectations for GPUs going into Q3 and for semicustom. How do you view the PC outlook within your total outlook above ATM? And I've got a quick follow-on.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [37]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSure. So let me talk about the PC market overall. I think our view of the PC market is pretty similar to others in the industry. We would say, overall for 2016, high-single digit decline. We have seen some positive signals, and we saw some positive data points from IDC earlier the last week. And then we saw a little bit of pickup in consumption in June from our OEM customers. But again, that was compared to -- let's call it a soft April/May.\\\\nOur view is OEM business looks okay. The channel for us is still weaker than we would like, and that's our view of the PC business. Even in that framework, we believe we can grow our Computing and Graphics business on the strength of the products. The Graphics products, we've talked about, as they ramp in the second half of the year. And on the Computing side as well, I think we have a number of new platforms, and back-to-school and holiday are important for us. So that's the way would characterize PCs.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [38]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSo, Lisa, not to put words in your mouth, but for Q3, PC's up but perhaps not up as much as seasonal? Is that the best way to think about it within your guide?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [39]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI would say roughly seasonal -- roughly seasonal.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [40]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat's helpful. And then lastly, guys, I apologize, but Devinder, now that you've got revenue growth behind you and you've got some momentum here, how do we think about the gross margin progression from here and kind of the puts and takes? And I know there's lot of different dynamics there, including the mix of semicustom. But from these levels, how should we think about gross margin progression over the next, call it, two to four quarters?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [41]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, John, I think the way you think about it is, it is the mix of business, so that's a good observation. But also you see us making continuing investments in our roadmap in graphics and in other areas, and we believe that will help us improve the gross margin. And then as you look out longer-term, as you observe -- get beyond a couple of quarters and get into 2017, we do have the Zen product introduction coming up. We also have a product in the pro graphics area, and that should drive even higher gross margins compared to where we are today, given the mix will get better with those products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJohn Pitzer,  Credit Suisse Group - Analyst    [42]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks.

This is Sidney Ho asking -- calling in for Ross. Just follow up to -- with the last question by focusing on third quarter, you guided third-quarter gross margin to be flat, but the profile seem -- of revenue growth seems to be -- would suggest gross margin should decline on a mix adjusted basis.\\\\nHow should we think about gross margin by segment in Q3? What are some of the moving parts? And maybe follow-up to that, do you expect the gross margin of the new custom design wins ramping this quarter to have better or worse margins than your game console business?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [46]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think that's well-put. I mean if you look overall when we have a higher mix of semicustom business, typically the gross margin is lower since the business model on the semicustom side has for the lower margin just the way the model is constructed. So keeping it flat at 31% with the guide in Q3 was variable in Q2. We were pretty pleased with that. And I think you're seeing some of the strength underlying the non-semicustom business is allowing us to keep it flat quarter-on-quarter.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [47]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Great. And then my follow-up question is -- you guys talked about the Zen products at Computex and it's on track for launching in the first half of 2017. Can you talk about the impact on R&D expense and maybe on gross margin on the preparation of this launch over the next few quarters? And if you hit your revenue plan that you have thought about, at what point do you need to start increasing OpEx from the $330 million to $350 million level?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [48]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThe OpEx side of it, if I look at it from that standpoint, you have seen our OpEx actually go up; in Q3, we are guiding at the $350 million level with specific targeted investments we are making in key R&D areas and products, in particular the high performance roadmap that we have laid out. But we are also making some specific investments in the marketing area, given the new products that are coming out on the PC side as well as the GPU side, trying to attract end-users back to the AMD brand.\\\\nAnd I think you'll continue to see us do that. And that helps obviously with this new product underlying the better margins that you get with the fresh cycle, in particular with the new technology areas that we are putting our products in.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [49]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat. Maybe just one quick follow-up. For Q4 with an extra week in the fiscal quarter, should we expect OpEx to be at the high end of levels, that that will be enough -- that $350 million?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [50]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI'm not prepared -- you know, one of the things about OpEx as I always say even if you look at Q3, the OpEx is up on a guided basis at $350 million, but very much as I always say, we manage the OpEx pretty tightly. We've done that over the last several years, and obviously it gets modulated somewhat by revenue. Q3, our revenue is up 18%, OpEx is at $350 million and we'll talk about Q4 when we gather here in about 90 days.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSidney Ho,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [51]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOperator    [52]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nI was also curious about GlobalFoundries being so low in Q2. And I guess have you guys finalized the 2016 wafer supply agreement? And can you talk more generally about which products -- how you are deciding which products are allocated to Global and TSMC? And is there anything that's exclusive to one or the other?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [54]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, several parts to it. I mean the working relationship, as Lisa said, with GlobalFoundries is very good. We continue to work through the 2016 WSA and that's not finalized; we're in the process of negotiating that. In the meantime, we continue to get delivery of wafers for the products that we need in line with the product demand and mix of business. And relative to your -- which products from which foundry, we typically do not share the source of foundry for any of our wafers or products.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [55]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. That's fair. And then with regards to kind of thinking about next year's OpEx, when you look at the importance of a CPU that can attack the server market and can attack the high end of the sort of enthusiast CPU market, I guess I don't want you to necessarily be constrained by the R&D requirements of the last couple of years.\\\\nI mean, so how do you think about that? If you start to show some revenue traction, I mean, can you -- how much flexibility do you think there is on spending? I'm not asking for a number, but just qualitatively, how are you thinking about profitability versus investing in these opportunities next year?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [56]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe, I would say my engineers would be very happy to hear you say that.\"),\n",

I think you've seen -- and Devinder said this -- we're going to be disciplined in OpEx. And as this quarter was an important turning point for us, to return to operating profitability, I think we have a nice sort of a view into Q3.\\\\nWe will look for opportunities to ensure that we are strategically placing the big bets in R&D, and both on the CPU and the GPU side. For example, this year, we have ramped up our investments on the graphics side with the formation of the Radeon Technologies Group, and what we're doing in both hardware and software -- very significant investments.\\\\nAnd similarly on the CPU side as well. So, I think we take very seriously our commitments in terms of profitability, but we will invest in the future and we'll continue to look for opportunities to balance those in the right way.\\\\nI don't know, Devinder, if you want to add --?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [57]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nNo, I think that's well-said. In 2017, obviously, as we get to the back half of the year, Q3 we have guided, we're getting to that -- get through Q3 and get into Q4. And at that point, we'll start thinking about where we want to place our bets as these are put in terms of the longer-term investments in 2017. Right now we're really focused on getting -- we got to non-GAAP operating profitability this quarter. We want to maintain that in Q3 and then we'll see what happens from there.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJoe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [58]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nGreat.

Are there any potential legal risks with it, potentially Intel?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [61]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. So relative to the server JV that we have with THATIC, as we stated before, we believe that our joint venture is operational. I think it's well underway. The technology that we're licensing is AMD technology, and so we don't have any issues relative to licensing. I think --\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nDevinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [62]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes. If I may add, I mean, one thing on the update, I guess, if you look at the prepared remarks and the commentary for Q3 is, we now expect, based on technology transfer milestone completion, to recognize $22 million to authorize a gain in Q3 and approximately $75 million for the year, which is higher than what we had said previously when we said it was $52 million for the year. So you can see it's incremental and therefore, as Lisa said, things are operationally on track and we continue to meet our technology transfer milestones from a date standpoint.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nMarco Chan,  Citigroup - Analyst    [63]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThat's very helpful.

Could you guys get into more detail, maybe talk about each segment individually, your trends for PCs versus GPUs?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [64]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we don't usually go into granularity about the subsegments of the business. I think it's fair to say that our PC business has stabilized. And what we're seeing now is the opportunity, as we go into the seasonally stronger half of the year on both the PC side and graphics side, on top of that with some new product launches, we believe that we will end up growing year-over-year.

I have a follow-up on your Project Scorpio comment. I think it's going to be launched in 2017. And I think you had significantly higher performance and support 4K and V.

So, again we don't -- we wouldn't disclose anything that's incrementally more than what our customer has disclosed. So I think Microsoft has talked about their goals with Project Scorpio. I think we are in support of those goals.

As a follow-up -- I think your competitor has launched a comparable mainstream product -- I think GeForce 10 6P, so given the absence of your maybe higher performance part launching maybe in the second half, so how should we think about the rest of the year on the demand on your graphics side?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [70]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, we are feeling very good about our Polaris launch. This was our strategy from the beginning. I mean we laid out a strategy where we were going after the mainstream, and growth rate, really a new experience in terms of both capability and price point. And I think we've done that.\\\\nWe've also been very focused on DX 12 and our performance -- on new APIs like Vulcan. So we are happy with our competitiveness. I think it's played out as we thought it would do. Certainly our aspirations in GPU are to certainly have very competitive products across the entire product line.

So EESC -- looks like you achieved operating income same level as third quarter of last year but with $45 million lower revenue.

So the profitability -- you're right about the observation, but profitability depends upon obviously -- the largest business we have in there right now is the semicustom business, but also the investments on the OpEx standpoint that we make year-on-year.

But these are relatively older products that are embedded into enterprise products at the moment then, it sounds like. Okay, great. And then my follow-on is -- you are at a one-year cadence for GPUs now. Could you talk about expectations on how last year's R9300 series winds down and how that plays out? It looks like in Q2, it was really just a lack of a pause ahead of a known refresh. And do you expect sort of a sharp wind-down at some point? Or is it more gradual?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [77]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nActually, Ian, that's a good observation. The 390 series or the 300 series overall actually did do okay in the second quarter. We were also wondering whether there would be a pause prior to a new generation. I think we see it as a very orderly transition; it's actually one of our better product transitions as we go from the 300 series over to the 400 series.\\\\nSo again, nothing very spectacular to report other than the sellthrough has continued -- the sellthrough was good in the second quarter.

Our final question today is coming from Jaguar Bajwa from Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [81]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nThanks for taking my question. Just a question on Q3. Could you just lay out which would be the fastest-growing sequential segment in Q3? Will that be the GPU business, CPU or semicustom? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [82]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar, I think what we would say is that our Q3 guidance is both semicustom and graphics will be the drivers of the sequential revenue growth.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [83]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Thanks. And then could you just give a bit more clarity around Vega timing? And also what do you expect to be your differentiation here versus what Nvidia has done with Pascal?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [84]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nAgain, I think we'll talk more about the details of the Vega architecture in time, but certainly Vega is a high-performance GPU that will use high-bandwidth memory as part of it. So, I would leave the details for a more -- as we go -- get closer to the Vega launch date.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [85]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay. Well, maybe just one final one then. When we get into the server CPU cycle with Zen, should we expect any kind of contribution from an APU format with CPU plus Vega? Because we're seeing a lot of acceleration now in the data center. Do you think that could be a key product for you guys which maybe your competitors may not have, bringing an APU to the server market for high-performance servers?\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nLisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [86]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nYes, I think it's fair to say that we do believe we can combine high-performance CPU with the high-performance GPU. As we look at our GPU compute in general, sort of our both professionals graphics and server markets for GPU, I think that will increasingly become an area of focus for us as we continue to grow the graphics business.\\\\nSo I think the answer is yes. I mean, obviously, it will come in time, but it's an area where combining the two technologies makes a lot of sense.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nJaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [87]\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nOkay.
